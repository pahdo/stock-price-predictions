Note 1. Basis of Presentation  

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Aina Le a, Inc. its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Lulana Gardens, LLC and Island Vista, LLC (collectively,
the Company, we, our or us). The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in February 2012. Prior to February 2012, we
operated as a Nevada limited liability company, Aina Le a LLC (the  LLC ). The LLC was formed in April 2009 with
DW Aina Le a Development, LLC ( DW ) as its managing member and sole owner. In February 2012, the LLC was converted
into Aina Le a, Inc. pursuant to a plan of conversion. In connection with the conversion, we issued 5,500,000 shares of common
stock to DW. The assets and liabilities of the LLC were recorded by us at their historical cost. We expect to eventually operate
two of our  villages  through Lulana Gardens, LLC and Island Vista, LLC. 

We are in the business of acquiring
and developing land for residential and commercial development. Our initial project is Phase 1 of the Villages of Aina Le a
( Villages ) project located on the Kohala Coast on the  Big Island  of Hawaii. We plan to construct 384
town homes ( Lulana Gardens ) and 48 villas ( Whale s Point ), and develop 70 single family residential
lots ( Ho olei Village ) for sale in Phase 1. We have developed substantial infrastructure and commenced construction
on 64 of the town homes. We acquired an additional 1,011 acres on November 17, 2015 from Bridge Aina Le a, LLC ( Bridge ).
Marketing of the Lulana Gardens townhomes and the Ho olei Village lots can begin once we file for and obtains the required
approval of its homeowner s association updates to its DCCA public filings and has met certain requirements of its development
obligations with Hawaii County. 

Our registration statement for our ongoing
initial public offering, for which Newbridge Securities Corporation ( Newbridge ) was approved by FINRA to serve as
our exclusive placement agent in the best efforts offering, was effective as of June 30, 2016. We have since withdrawn the registration
statement for our initial public offering to effectively remove Newbridge as its exclusive placement agent. We expect our shares to be traded over NASDAQ under the symbol  AIZY. As of the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, no proceeds have been received or used from the registered offering. 

These unaudited consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) applicable to interim financial information and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, such unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures required in annual
financial statements. 

In management s opinion, these
unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements contained in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on July 14, 2016. The interim results
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending
March 31, 2017 or any future period.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  

Principles of consolidation  

The condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of management estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Restricted cash  

Restricted cash consists of funds held
for construction consisting of an $85,000 bond for waterline infrastructure and $2,000,000 for the road and intersection infrastructure
required by Hawaii County ordinance. The Waikoloa Village Association accepted the completion of the waterline and the $85,000
was released November 3, 2016. The $2,000,000 will be used to pay the road/intersection construction costs upon approval by the
Hawaii Department of Transportation. 

Prepaid expense  

Prepaid expenses consist of amounts
paid in advance for which we will receive goods or services within the next normal accounting cycle. Included in prepaid expenses
are initial public offering costs of $21,643 and $850,454 as of September 30 and March 31, 2016, respectively. These costs, plus
costs incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016, are associated with the registration statement withdrawn on July 29,
2016. We have reviewed the detail of these costs and determined that $893,381 in costs incurred prior to the withdrawal of the
registration statement no long continue to have value to the registration statement. These costs have been expensed in the period
ended September 30, 2016. 

Real estate project in development  

The real estate project in development
is stated at cost. We capitalize all direct costs of the project including land acquisition, planning, design, grading, infrastructure,
town home construction, landscaping, taxes, fees and direct project management. General management and administration costs are
expensed as incurred. We also capitalize interest and other carrying costs used in developing properties from the date of initiation
of development activities through the date the property is substantially complete and ready for sale. During periods of extended
delays, interest capitalization may be suspended, depending on the cause and duration of the delay. Interest capitalization was
suspended from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015 due to delays caused by difficulties in gaining financing related to zoning
challenges by the Hawaii State Land Use Commission ( LUC ). During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
we capitalized $2,513,698 and $1,459,899 in interest, respectively. Certain costs are allocated based on the purchase price of
individual land parcels identified in the purchase and sale agreement. Land in development includes leasehold interests in land
resulting from the transfer of Undivided Land Fractions ( ULFs ). Certain identified common costs are required to be
allocated among the different phases of the development as it is completed. We are currently evaluating the different allocation
methods before initial sales begin.

Impairment of long-lived assets  

We perform an impairment test when events
or circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that we consider
indicators of impairment include significant decreases in market values and adverse changes in regulatory requirements, including
environmental laws. Impairment tests for properties under development involve the use of estimated future net undiscounted cash
flows expected to be generated from the use of property and its eventual disposition. Measurement of the impairment loss is based
on the fair value of the asset. Generally, we determine fair value using valuation techniques such as discounted expected future
cash flows. 

We estimate the fair value of the project
based upon the expected net proceeds from the sales of the units and lots, giving consideration to selling costs, the absorption
period and estimated costs to complete. Proceeds from sales of Lulana Gardens and Ho olei Village developments are estimated
based upon comparable sales transactions and give consideration to affordable housing pricing limitations where applicable. The
absorption period used gives consideration to our need to raise construction funding and complete development. 

Estimated costs to complete are derived
from estimates from our contractors and consulting engineers and give consideration to current and projected labor and materials
costs. As of September 30 and March 31, 2016, we determined that no write down from the carrying value of the project was required. 

Other noncurrent assets  

Other assets at September 30, 2016 primarily
includes primarily $1,150,000 related to the purchase of loans (see Note 8), and repayment terms with the contractor have not been
finalized. 

Contracts payable to land trust  

In order to raise capital for the initial
development of the Villages project, we sold undivided land fractions to investors from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2014.
The ULF agreements require that we repurchase the ULFs at a future date for a price higher than the original purchase price. Due
to the repurchase provision, the ULF sales are accounted for as debt instruments, contracts payable to land trust, and the difference
between the purchase price and the repurchase price is recognized over the period of the ULF as interest expense, using a method
which materially approximates the effective interest method. 

We have acquired the beneficial interests
associated with certain of the contracts payable to land trust and in accordance with terms of an agreement with the power of interest
of the land trust has presented the balance due net of such amounts. 

Reclassifications   

Certain prior period financial statement
amounts been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We have also revised classification of certain cash flow
statement items for the period ended September 30, 2015 which reduced cash used in operating activity by $1,893,016, from $5,737,086
to $3,844,070, and decreased cash provided by financing activities by $1,893,016, from $2,651,287 to $758,271.

Income taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for using
an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred
tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided
when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain
tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement .  We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. We will file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in Hawaii. We did not have any uncertain
tax positions at September 30 and March 31, 2016. 

Our policy for deducting interest and
penalties is to treat interest as interest expense and penalties as taxes. We have not accrued any amounts for the payment of interest
or penalties related to any uncertain tax positions at September 30 and March 31, 2016, as its review of such positions indicated
that such potential positions were minimal. We are subject to the examination of its tax returns by tax authorities beginning April
1, 2012. 

Fair Value Disclosures  

The carrying amounts of cash, restricted
cash and trade payables approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of our borrowing approximate
their carrying value based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 

Concentrations and other risks  

Financial instruments that potentially
subject us to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and restricted cash. Cash is held in financial institution. Restricted
cash consists of $2,085,000 at September 30 and March 31, 2016. At September 30 and March 31, 2016, $1,833,810 and $1,750,000,
respectively, were held in accounts not covered by FDIC insurance. 

We conduct our operations in the state
of Hawaii, on Hawaii Island. Consequently, any significant economic downturn in the Hawaii real estate market could potentially
have an effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We have entered into a fixed price contract
with a contractor under which the contractor is to construct all the Lulana Gardens units at a fixed, per unit price. We have not
obtained a performance bond from the contractor. Should the contractor fail to complete its contract or should the contractor seek
price increases as a result of increased material or labor costs, we may encounter delays or cost increases which could negatively
impact our ability to complete the construction, as well as the profitability, of the Lulana Gardens project. 

We have entered into cost plus contracts
with a guaranteed maximum price with a contractor to complete certain phases of the infrastructure of Phase 1 of the Villages.
We have not obtained a performance bond from the contractor.

Recently issued accounting standards  

The FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update 2014-15   Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about
an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   The new standard requires management to assess the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. Disclosures are required if there is substantial doubt as to the Company's continuation as a going
concern within one year after the issue date of financial statements. The standard provides guidance for making the assessment,
including consideration of management's plans, which may alleviate doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. The guidance is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
We are currently evaluating the potential impact that adoption may have on our consolidated financial statements. 

The FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2015-16   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  
which requires that acquirers in business combinations recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during measurement
periods in the reporting periods in which adjusted amounts are determined. The update requires that acquirers  record, in
the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects,
if any, resulting from changes in provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at acquisition date.
The update also requires separate income statement presentation or note disclosure of amounts recorded in current period earnings
by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the provisional amount adjustments had been recognized
at acquisition date (requirements to retrospectively account for those adjustments have been eliminated). This update applies to
all entities that reported provisional amounts in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by reporting period
end, and in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized.
Entities should disclose the nature and reason for changes in accounting principle in the first annual period of adoption, and
in interim periods within the first annual period if there are measurement-period adjustments during the first annual period in
which the changes are effective. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including
interim periods within that reporting period. Amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional
amounts that occur after its effective date, with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
We plan to apply this guidance where applicable in any future business combinations. 

The FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
 which provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and any amendments must be
adopted in the same period. We do not expect adoption of this amendment to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3. Going Concern  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. We have sustained losses and experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception,
and have an accumulated deficit of $42,485,210 at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue to operate in the normal course of business as a going concern. We have funded our activities to date almost exclusively
from equity and debt financings. 

We will continue to require substantial
funds to continue development of the Villages project. Management s plan in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements
includes financing activities such as private issuances of debt, equity financing and the continued establishment of strategic
relationships which we expect will lead to the completion of our revenue opportunities.

        Table of Contents  

While we believe that we will be successful
in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations, there is no assurance that such additional funding will be achieved
or that we will succeed in our future operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note
5   .  Real    Estate  Project
 in  Development   

Our current real estate projects in
development consist of approximately 61 acres with 384 townhomes (Lulana Gardens) and 48 luxury villas (Whale s Point) on
38 acres, and 70 residential lots on 23 acres (Ho olei Village) (collectively  Phase 1 ). On November 17, 2015,
we purchased and closed on the remaining 1,011-acres of residential property of the Villages from Bridge. Real estate project in
development costs are summarized as follows: 

We capitalized $2,267,197 in interest
cost through March 31, 2011, during active development of the land and construction of the town homes. Interest costs from April
1, 2011 through March 31, 2015 were expensed due to a substantial reduction in construction activities. The reduction in activity
relates to difficulties in gaining financing due to alleged zoning issues raised by the LUC. From the inception of the project
through March 31, 2015, we expensed a total of $27,746,664 in interest costs including the amortization of loan costs. We resumed
normal development activities in April 2015 and capitalized $2,513,698 and $1,459,899 for the six months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. 

Note 6. Contracts Payable to Land
Trust  

To assist in its acquisition and development
of real estate projects, we sell ULFs to investors. Through the ULF program, an investor receives a warranty deed to an undivided
fractional interest in a property and then contributes the deed to a land trust (the  Trust ) in exchange for a beneficial
interest in the Trust. Concurrent with the transfer of the ULF, the investor enters into a joint development agreement with the
Company. Concurrently, the investor also appoints CAG as the holder of the power of direction in the Trust. The arrangement also
provides for the appointment of an independent third party as trustee to manage the Trust and for the trustee to take direction
from CAG. Upon completion and sale of the improvements on the property, the Trust receives a fixed sum from the Company, the trustee
distributes the proceeds to the ULF investor and re-conveys the deed covering the property back to us and cancels the beneficial
interest in the Trust. If the land is not sold within 30 months of the transfer of the deed to the beneficiary of the Trust, we
are required to increase the fixed sum by 1% per month.

Pursuant to the ULF arrangement, the
Company is obligated to immediately pay to the Trust a one-time lump sum lease payment of $500 within 90 days of purchase of ULF
and an additional $12,000 upon the sale of the townhouse or lot. All lease payments have been made to investors totaling $2,299,500
through September 30, 2016. As a result of construction delays during the course of the zoning litigation, the Company has not
paid the $12,000 at or prior to the end of 30 months from the date of the transfer of the deed. Accordingly, the Company has accrued
a penalty interest of 1% per month is due on the $9,600 original investment as required. Additionally, the Company could be removed
as developer of Trust No. 1 of the Project 32 months after the last deed was delivered to the Trust. As of September 30, 2016,
the last deed was delivered to the Trust on October 1, 2012. No additional deeds were to be transferred to the Trust, and as such,
the Company could be removed as developer of Trust No. 1 of the Project effective April 2016. The Company has not received any
notices from the Trust and does not expect to be removed as the developer. Additionally, all deeds were contributed to Trust No.
2 in November 2015.  

We accrete interest on the ULF proceeds
over a 32-month period. If we repurchase the ULF before the 32-month period has expired, the full accreted interest for the 32-month
period must be paid. ULF financial activity and position is summarized as follows: 

Certain ULF contracts totaling $2,496,000
at September 30 and March 31, 2016 provide for us to repay the ULF holders in Singapore dollars. Based on applicable foreign exchange
rates, gains of $18,790 and $86,556 were recorded for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In March 2012, we entered into an arrangement
with the power of interest in the Trust which governs how the proceeds from sales are to be distributed. Under the arrangement,
as sales proceeds are received into escrow, the Company is to receive directly from escrow, prior to any payments being made to
the Trust, the pro-rata share of the sales proceeds represented by the beneficial interests held by us. Based on the arrangement,
we have netted the carrying value of its beneficial interests against the contract payable due to the Trust. The amounts attributable
to the beneficial interests and contracts payable to land trust is summarized as follows:

Note 8. Financing Activities  

Pursuant to recently issued accounting
standard FASB ASU 2015-03   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs  , we have adopted this guidance for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 which includes interim periods within
this reporting period. The comparative March 31, 2016 loan fees and note payable balances have been retrospectively reclassified
to conform to the reporting standards for this reporting period. Loan fees of $685,488 have been reclassified from other current
assets to the respective loans as of March 31, 2016 and are disclosed on the following short-term and long-term summaries. 

Short-Term Debt  

We have mutually agreed with American
Savings Bank, F.S.B. to extend the Loan Purchase Agreement to May 15, 2017 for an extension fee which was paid on October 31,
2016. The extension also includes monthly installments that will be applied to the balance of the loan purchase. Additionally,
if we are able to make a lump sum payment of the balance due under the amended Loan Purchase Agreement before December 29, 2016,
there would be a waiver of an extension fee.  $500,000 of the purchase agreement was removed from the condensed consolidated
financial statements as of June 30, 2016 because we were in default of the original payment terms. The $500,000 has been included
in the September 30, 2016 condensed consolidated financial statements as an increase in other assets due to the renegotiation.  

 On November 12, 2015, we executed a
one-year $6,000,000 land loan with Libo Zhang, a Chinese national, with the net proceeds made available for the purchase of the
1,011 residential acres acquired from Bridge. The loan is secured by a portion of Phase 1 (parcel D-1-B-1), bears interest at 12%
per annum and matures on November 12, 2016. DW transferred 33,091 (23,091 and 10,000 shares in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively)
of its shares in the Company to the lender as additional security to this loan. We have recorded this consideration as an additional
debt discount of $455,001 based on the number of shares transferred at the per share offering price of $13.75 as listed in our
registration statement. Interest of $720,000 was withheld by the lender from of the gross proceeds at funding. 

On November 17, 2015, we executed
a three-year $14,000,000 land loan with Bridge, with the net proceeds made available for the purchase of the 1,011-acres. The
loan is secured by a mortgage bearing interest at 12% per annum, payable, interest only, monthly and matures November 17,
2018.  In July 2016, we did not make the required monthly interest payment on the loan with Bridge and went into
default. We negotiated a Forbearance Agreement in October 2016 that has relieved monthly interest payments until March
15, 2017, with a required payment of $150,000 against accrued interest and related penalties due of $947,940 from July 1,
2016 through September 30, 2016. The loan is accruing interest at the default rate of 24%. 

In June 2016, we executed a
maximum borrowing of $400,000 temporary bridge working capital note with Adriatic Ventures LLC. The note was reduced
to $163,500, bears a 7% annual interest rate, requires a 3% loan fee for each advance against the note, and is due the
earlier of December 15, 2016 or the date of the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering, as amended in October 2016.
The note is personally guaranteed by the Company s CEO. 

During the period, we executed one commercial
premium finance agreement for an insurance policy with a maturity of less than one year.

On July 24, 2015, we executed and closed
on a two-year $12,000,000 construction loan with Romspen Investment Corporation, with the net proceeds available for operations
and project development. The loan is secured by the Company s interest in a portion of Phase 1 (parcel D-1-B-2), bears interest
at 12.5% per annum, payable monthly, and required advance fees of $712,112 upon the first draw. The loan requires an interest reserve
of $1,250,000 to be held by the lender. The loan is personally guaranteed by the Company's CEO. 

We closed on a portion of the 6% interest,
five-year $34,000,000 term loan with Whales Point Fund LLP on September 30, 2016, which will be funded by the EB-5 investor program.
The loan will be secured by a portion of Phase 1 (parcel D-1-B-2). Interest on advanced funds is due and payable quarterly.

Note 9. Legal Proceedings  

Mauna Lani Resort Association
v. County of Hawaii, et.al.   

We are party to a lawsuit wherein its
former parent company, DW, Relco and the County of Hawaii are party to a case in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit State of
Hawaii ( See Mauna Lani Resort Ass n. v. County Planning Department of Hawaii, et. al, No. 11-01-005K ) (the  Mauna
Lani Lawsuit ). The plaintiff s cause of action is for declaratory and injunctive relief and alleges that Hawaii County,
in its review of the Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) that was prepared to address the environmental impact of
the Villages development, failed to consider the full area that might be developed in the future as a result of a joint development
agreement amongst DW and Bridge whose land is adjacent to the Villages development. The matter was heard by the Circuit Court of
Hawaii. The court remanded the matter back to the planning department to determine whether the project was a segment of a larger
project or whether there were cumulative impacts that were not fully analyzed. The court denied compensation or legal fees for
Mauna Lani Resort Association. The County requested and the Company have commenced a supplemental environmental impact statement.
Additionally, Hawaii County confirmed our permits and confirmed it will issue certificates of occupancy for Phase 1 of the project
once the supplemental environmental impact statement, town homes, and infrastructure are completed. We expect satisfactory completion
of the supplemental environmental impact statement and believe that the Mauna Lani Lawsuit is without merit and will not substantially
impact or delay our development of the Villages. 

In addition to the above, from time
to time, we may be involved in various legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.

Overview and Recent Developments  

Aina Le a,
Inc. is in the business of acquiring and developing land for residential and commercial development. Our mission is to build the
finest integrated communities for high growth local economies. 

Our initial project,
known as the Villages of Aina Le a (the  Villages ), consists of approximately 1,099 acres of land located on
the Kohala Coast on Hawaii Island in the state of Hawaii. Our plans for the Villages include approximately 2,200 residential homes,
an exclusive lodge and a 440,000 square foot mixed use commercial center complete with medical facilities. The first phase of the
Villages is a 61.4-acre land parcel ( Phase 1 ), which consists of 38 acres, on which we are constructing 384 town
homes ( Lulana Gardens ) and 48 villas ( Whale s Point ) and of 23 acres, where 70 single-family
residential lots ( Ho olei Village ) are for sale. As of the date of this report, we have developed substantial
infrastructure and commenced construction of 64 town homes. We have begun development activity on the additional 1,011 acres surrounding
Phase 1. The 1,011 acres will be developed for 1,807 luxury home lots. We have an option to acquire an additional 27 acres of adjacent
commercial property. 

Our principal executive
offices are located at 69-201 Waikoloa Beach Drive, #2617, Waikoloa, Hawaii 96738, and our telephone number is (808) 886-1702.

Our Initial Project The Villages of Aina Le a  

For our first project,
we acquired Phase 1 of the Villages, consisting of 384 town homes, 48 luxury villas and 70 single family lots aggregating 61.4
acres in Waikoloa, South Kohala, on Hawaii Island in the state of Hawaii. The Villages include a residential multifamily townhome
condominium project (with each lot being developed as a separate single-lot project or a phase of a multi-lot project), pursuant
to Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 514B, as amended ( Condo Town Home Project ). We anticipate that the townhome units
being built in the Condo Town Home Project will be offered for sale to moderate income families to satisfy state and county of
Hawaii affordable housing requirements imposed on the project and the surrounding planned community described below. The remaining
portion of Phase 1 is an additional 70 lots that will be developed separately. The 70-lot portion of the land is comprised of approximately
23 acres located on the east side of Phase 1, and the 384 town homes of Phase 1 is comprised of approximately 38 acres. Phase 1
is located within the Villages project, a 1,099-acre master-planned community. The completion of the development of Phase 1 is
dependent on our success in obtaining additional debt or equity financing. Marketing of the Lulana Gardens town homes and the Ho olei
Village lots can begin once we file for and obtain the required approval of our homeowner s association, update our real
estate public filings with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in Hawaii, and have met certain requirements of our
development obligations with Hawaii County. 

On the Kohala Coast,
each resort has built its own utilities and infrastructure. In building the Villages, we are constructing a water system, a wastewater
treatment facility, an electrical distribution system, a cable system, county roadways connecting to the major highway, a signalized
intersection on the major highway and all internal roadways. This infrastructure is being developed in phases as each of the parcels
are planned and developed for sale. Currently, we are finishing the infrastructure for Phase 1 of the Villages. The infrastructure
will be expanded as each additional village is planned and approved for sale to luxury home builders. We have retained Schmidt
  Curley, one of the leading golf course architects in the world, to design and supervise the construction and installation
of a world-class tournament golf course. 

We completed the
installment purchase of the 1,072 acres of residential property on November 17, 2015. We paid $24,000,000 for the remaining 1,011
acres with cash at closing of $10,000,000 and we issued a three-year, 12% interest, note to Bridge for the remaining $14,000,000,
due at maturity. We have an option to purchase the adjacent 27 acres of commercial zone property on or before November 17, 2018.
We have made deposits for certain identified infrastructure improvements to the acreage, including a $2,000,000 deposit for development
and construction of a road/intersection at Queen Kaahumanu Highway. 

From 2009 through
September 30, 2016, we raised approximately $44,000,000 (before fees and commissions) in financing for the development of Phase
1 from the sale of Undivided Land Fractions ( ULFs ) to over 1,000 investors from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan,
Australia, and Indonesia. The proceeds were used to acquire and fund the development of Phase 1. 

The ULF sales were
marketed through an exclusive marketing arrangement with Capital Asia Group Pte Ltd ( CAG ), which, pursuant to a registered
Public Offering Statement in Hawaii, allowed us to begin transferring 4,320 Lulana Gardens ULFs deeds and 2,800 Ho olei Village
ULFs in Phase 1 to our investors. Investors were required to transfer their deeds into a designated land trust (the  Trust ),
in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Trust, and sign a development agreement allowing us to develop the project. The contribution
of the deeds into the associated trusts was completed in November 2015. Upon completion and sale of the improvement on Phase I,
the beneficial interest holders will receive a fixed sum plus accreted interest, if any, from us, and the related Trust will convey
the deeds covering the improvements which are the subject of our sales.

        Table of Contents  

We have finalized
the engineering for the infrastructure needed to complete the town homes and have completed and filed the architectural design
for a Planned Unit Development of 70 single-family home lots on Phase 1. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell
the completed improvements or that we will realize the estimated value. 

As an added potential
benefit of our East Asian-focused ULF program and the direct investment in the Company by Shanghai Zhongyou Real Estate Group ( ZY )
(see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below), we believe that our Asian investors are also ideally suited to introduce
the Villages to prospective homebuyers, commercial real estate buyers and retail operators throughout East Asia. We believe that
their extensive network of investors may enable our company to access buyers in China, Japan, Korea and other Asian markets, as
well as to benefit from our ULF Trust interest holders input into residential product planning that appeals to potential buyers. 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements included in this Report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 

See Item 7,  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and the notes to our audited financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 for further discussion of critical accounting
policies and estimates. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2016. 

Pursuant to the
JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company, we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised
accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC. We have elected not to opt out
of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make
comparisons of our financial statements with any other public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging
growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible, as different or revised standards
may be used. 

Although we are
still evaluating the JOBS Act, we currently intend to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements
that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an  emerging growth company.  We have elected not to opt out
of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS
Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation
report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company,
which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise,
so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide certain information, including certain financial
information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide
in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us. As a result, investor
confidence in us and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.

Results of Operations  

We are in the construction
and development stage of Phase 1 of our initial project and the development planning stage of the additional 1,011 acres, the
Villages at Aina Le a, and as such, has recorded no operating revenues to date. Construction activity on the Villages project
was substantially delayed from April 2011 until March 2015 due to difficulties in securing financing as a result of zoning challenges
by the Hawaii Land Use Commission. After a favorable final judgment, we have now secured the necessary financing to resume construction
activities and have determined that capitalization of interest cost was appropriate beginning April 1, 2015. 

Following is a discussion
of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the information
included in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The net loss
increase is mainly attributable to increased payroll related expenses, interest expense, and the write-off of IPO costs over the
prior period comparison. The increase in interest expense relates to amounts that exceed the calculation for capitalization required
under generally accepted accounting principles. 

The following summarizes the results of our operations for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our net loss increased by $1,931,611
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to increase
interest expense and the write off of previously capitalized IPO costs, offset by the foreign exchange gains.  

The following summarizes the results of our operations for
the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our net loss increased by $2,918,158
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to increase interest
expense and the write off of previously capitalized IPO costs, offset by the foreign exchange gains.

Cash Flows   

As of September
30, 2016 we had $587,986 in cash and cash equivalents, which is being used to fund ongoing operations and development for the Villages
project. We had $2,085,000 in restricted cash of which $85,000 was held in a bond for the waterline and $2,000,000 was held in
escrow for road/intersection costs as of September 30 and March 31, 2016. 

Our total liabilities
increased $6,945,939 from March 31, 2016 primarily due to increased debt associated with additional cost incurred for the real
estate project in development. 

Our net working
capital deficit increased by $3,684,551 compared with March 31, 2016 primarily due to the renegotiation of short-term debt of $350,000
to long-term, net decrease in debt issuance cost of $683,950, increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1,546,200,
increase in related party notes of $278,528, increase in short-term debt $175,518 and decreases in cash and cash equivalents and
prepaid expenses of $1,000,355. 

We had $20,471,947
in short-term financing and $10,255,601 in long-term financing (see Note 8 to the condensed unaudited financial statements). We
also had $40,465,107 in contracts payable to the ULF investors, of which $26,171,600 is reported as a current liability, and will
be paid as the town homes are sold (see Note 6 of the condensed unaudited financial statements). 

Cash used by operating
activities decreased by $1,269,191 for the six months ended September 30, 2015 to the six months ended September 30, 2016, primarily
due to a net decrease in cash from the changes in working capital expended on the project, which is driven by accounts payable
and other current and non-current assets and other current liabilities. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was decreased net
income adjusted for non-cash items, including non-cash capitalized interest costs. 

We used no cash
for investing activities in 2016 or 2015. 

Cash provided by
financing activities increased by $1,581,439 from the six months ended September 30, 2015 to the six months ended September 30,
2016, primarily due to a net increase in debt used to finance the project under development partially offset by repayments of short-term
debt and fees paid associated with the initial public offering. 

In June 2016, we
executed and closed on a temporary bridge financing promissory note to fund operations with a maximum of $400,000. The note matures
at the earlier of December 15, 2016 or the date of the closing of a firmly written public offering, as amended. The unpaid principal
balance bears a 7% annual interest rate and a lender fee of 3% for each advance against the loan. We received one advance of $150,000
on June 29, 2016, accrued a $4,500 loan fee and two loan extension fees for $4,500 each.

We received additional
advances in April 2016 of $350,000 and in September 2016 of $300,000 for project expenditures related to the EB-5 investor program.
We closed on a portion of the $34,000,000 term loan with Whales Point Fund LLP on September 30, 2016 which will be funded by the
EB-5 investors (see Note 8 of the condensed unaudited financial statements). 

We have negotiated
a $77,000,000 bond issuance through the investment firm Ziegler Capital Markets ( Ziegler ) to buy out the Trust and
fund the development and sale of the townhomes. Ziegler has agreed to complete the bond closing upon the guarantee of Certificates
of Occupancy by Hawaii County. The remaining funds, after purchase of the Trust ownership, will be used to finance remaining portions
of Phase 1 on 38 acres. No assurances can be made that any or all of such financings will close or that such amounts will be raised. 

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have sustained losses and experienced negative cash flows
from operations since inception, and have an accumulated deficit of $42,485,210 at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue to operate in the normal course of business as a going concern. We have funded our activities
to date almost exclusively from equity and debt financings. 

We will continue
to require substantial funds to continue development of the Villages project. Management s plan in order to meet our operating
cash flow requirements includes financing activities such as private issuances of debt, equity financing and the continued establishment
of strategic relationships which we expect will lead to the completion of our revenue opportunities. 

While we believe
that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations, there is no assurance that such additional
funding will be achieved or that we will succeed in our future operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We did not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements as of September 30, 2016. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk   

We are a smaller
reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this Item. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2016, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified below. 

As further described
in  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures  in our 2016 Annual Report, management concluded that material weakness existed
as of March 31, 2016 because we did not design and maintain effective controls over documentation of procedures including procedures
related to testing of internal controls and entity-level controls, disclosure review, and other analytics, and the complexity in
accounting for multi-phase development projects.

        Table of Contents  

Our
management feels the weaknesses identified above have not had any material effect on our financial results.  However, we
are currently reviewing and revising our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect
to implement changes in the next fiscal year, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and
financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses. 

Our management will
continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements,
as necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no significant
changes made to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting at the reasonable assurance level. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings    

Mauna Lani Resort Association v.
County of Hawaii, et.al.   

Mauna Lani Resort
Association, a neighboring development, sued Hawaii County and the Company challenging that our final environmental impact statement
was deficient. The case was remanded to the County, and the Company along with the County are addressing any deficiencies. On May
23, 2014, Hawaii County confirmed our permits and confirmed it will issue certificates of occupancy for Phase 1 of the project
once the supplemental environmental impact statement, townhomes, and infrastructure are completed. We expect satisfactory completion
of the supplemental environmental impact statement and believe that the Mauna Lani Lawsuit is without merit and will not substantially
impact or delay our development of the Villages. 

From time to time, we may be involved
in various legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.

 benefit pursuant to the provisions   of this 
 note.  

6.                     
  Computation   of 
 Interest   and   Fees. 
 All   computations   of 
 interest   and   fees 
 under this   note   will 
 be   made   on 
 the   basis   of 
 a   year   of 
 360 days   and   in 
 each   case   for 
 the   actual number of days   (including 
 the   first day   but excluding 
 the last   day (actual/360) occurring in   the 
 period for which such   interest   or
fees are   payable (to the extent computed on   the
basis   of   days elapsed). 
 Each determination by Lender of   an interest amount 
 or fee under this   note will be made   in 
 good faith and, except for manifest error,   will 
 be final, conclusive, and binding on   Borrower.  

7.                     
  Prepayments   and 
 Prepayment   Prohibition.   (a) 
 Borrower   acknowledges   that 
 all loan   fees   and 
 other   prepaid   finance 
 charges   are earned on   the 
 day that   Borrower   signs this note,
and that Lender   will not refund   these 
 sums if   Borrower prepays some or   all 
 of   the sums   due under this 
 note,   unless required by   law.  

Whales   Point   Fund,   LLP   -   Promissory   Note      Page 2  of 8   

(b)               
  Borrower   shall 
 not   prepay   any 
 part   of   the 
 sums   advanced   under 
 this   note prior   to 
 the   Maturity   Date. 
 Borrower   acknowledges   that 
 the   funds   Lender 
 is providing to   Borrower are funds obtained 
 through the   EB-5 program, and that the   EB-5
program   requires that an investor's   funds
be    at-risk    for 
 the duration of   the EB-5 program. As   such, 
 Borrower acknowledges that attempts   to   pre-pay
sums advanced under this   note will   likely
jeopardize Lender's relationship with   Lender's investors. 
 As such,   Lender shall not to attempt to 
 prepay sums advanced   pursuant to   this
note and the   Term   Loan Agreement. Any 
 prepayments made   in violation of   this
section   7 will be   void.  

(c)               
  Borrower   shall 
 not   send   Lender 
 any   payments   marked 
  paid   in   full ,  without 
 recourse ,   or   with 
 any   similar   language. 
 If   Borrower   sends 
 such a payment to   Lender,   Lender 
 may accept   that   payment 
 without losing   any   of 
 Lender's rights   under   this note, the
 paid  in full  and  without recourse  language will be ineffective, and Borrower will remain obligated
to pay all   sums due under this   note.  

8.                     
   Manner   of 
 Payment.    Borrower   shall 
 make   each   payment 
 required   to   be 
 made under   this   note 
 (whether   of   principal, 
 interest,   fees,   or 
 of   other   amounts 
 payable   under   this 
 note) prior   to   2:00 
 p.m.   CST, on the   date when due, in 
 immediately available   funds,   without 
 set-off   or   counterclaim. Any 
 amounts   received after   such 
 time   on   any date 
 may,   in   Lender's discretion, 
 be deemed   to have been   received on
the   next   succeeding 
 Business   Day   for purposes of calculating
interest   on that   payment. 
 Borrower shall   make all   such payments
to Lender either   at its Payment Office or by   electronic 
 transfer   from   Borrower's operating 
 account.   If any payment under this   note
becomes   due on a day that   is not 
 a Business Day, the   date   for that
payment will   be extended   to the next 
 Business   Day,   and, in the case of 
 any payment accruing interest,   interest on that payment 
 will be   due   for the period of 
 the extension.  

9.                     
   Repayment   of 
 the   Indebtedness.    Subject 
 to   any   extensions, 
 Borrower   shall   repay the 
 principal   amount   of 
 all   sums   advanced 
 under   this   note, 
 together   with   all 
 accrued and unpaid interest,   on the Maturity Date. 
 Borrower shall   pay   Lender at Lender's
address stated   in section 22, or   at 
 another   place that   Lender designates
in   writing.  

10.                   
   Interest   after 
 Default.    Upon   an 
 Event   of   Default, 
 including   Borrower's   failure 
 to make   the   final 
 payment   due   under 
 this   note, the   interest rate on 
 this   note will automatically,   and
without   notice   required from Lender, increase
to 10% annual   interest. The   increased 
 interest rate will apply on   the   day
after the occurrence   of an Event   of 
 Default.  

11.                   
   Extension   of 
 the   Maturity   Date. 
  Borrower   may,   not 
 more   than   one 
 time,   by delivering   a 
 written   notice   to 
 Lender   no   earlier than 
 60 days and no later than 30 days   prior to the Maturity 
 Date,   request   that 
 Lender extend   the Maturity Date for   an 
 additional 12 calendar months. Lender may, in   its 
 sole discretion,   grant Borrower's request 
 for this one-year   extension,   but
only   if, as of   the first 
 day   of   the proposed one-year extension, 
 Borrower is not   in Default and no Event of Default 
 exists. The Interest Rate   during any extension 
 will be the   Default   Rate. If Lender
grants the extension,   Borrower shall pay   Lender's
costs and   expenses   including 
 legal   fees, arising   out 
 of   the extension.

12.                    
  Collateral.   This 
 note   is   secured 
 by   the   Collateral 
 described   in   the 
  Term    Loan 
 Agreement.  

13.                    
  Interest   Rate 
 Limitation.   If,   for 
 any   reason,   the 
 fulfillment   of   any 
 provisions   of this   note 
 or   of   any other document signed
in   connection   with 
 this note, at the time   performance of such provision, causes the 
 interest rate   of   this note to 
 exceed the maximum rate   permitted by law, the 
 obligation   to be   fulfilled 
 will   be reduced to the maximum rate   permitted
by   law.  

14.   Events   of   Default. 
 The   occurrence   of 
 any   Event   of 
 Default   as   defined 
 in   Article   8   

 of   the 
  Term    Loan 
 Agreement   will   be 
 deemed   to   be 
 an   Event   of 
 Default   under   this 
 note. 

15.                   
  Effect   of 
 an   Event   of 
 Default.   Upon   occurrence 
 of   an   Event 
 of   Default,   Lender may 
 declare   the   entire 
 unpaid   balance   plus 
 all   accrued   unpaid 
 interest   immediately due, and Borrower must pay 
 this amount.   In addition,   Lender
may   exercise any   other 
 right or   remedy granted   by 
 any   other Loan   Document with 
 respect to   an   Event 
 of   Default.  

16.                    
  Recovery   of 
 Returned   Payments.   If 
 Lender   must   return 
 to Borrower   any   payment previously 
 applied   to   Borrower's 
 obligations   under   this 
 note because of   a voidable preference under the Bankruptcy Code 
 or for   any other reason, Borrower and   any 
 guarantor   of   this note will remain 
 liable for the   full amount   returned. 
 Borrower   and   every 
 guarantor of this   note will   remain
liable   for the returned sum as   though 
 Lender had never received it.  

17.

 other   person   who

 hereby   waives   presentment 
 for   payment,   demand for payment,
and notice   of dishonor.  

18.                    
  Lender's   Rights. 
 Lender   may   exercise 
 the   following   rights 
 without   giving   notice 
 to   anyone,   getting 
 consent   from   anyone, 
 or   releasing   anyone from the 
 obligation to pay   the full amount of this note:  

(1)   Reduce   the   amount 
 of   or   delay 
 the   due   date 
 of   any   payment 
 due   under   this 
 note;    

(2)   Extend,

 other   provision   of 
 this   note   in 
 a   manner   that

(3)   Release   any   security, 
 including   one   or 
 more   co-guarantors;    

(4)   Sue   any 
 guarantor   without   first 
 suing   Borrower   or 
 any   other   person 
 or   pursuing   any 
 other remedy   available   to 
 Lender;   or    

(5)   Collect   money 
 from   one   or 
 more   guarantors   irrespective 
 of   any   real 
 or   personal   defenses that 
 Borrower   may   have.    

19.                    
 Lender's   Exercise   of 
 Lender's   Rights.   Each 
 right   granted   to 
 Lender   under   this 
 note   is   separate

a 
 time,   all   at 
 once,   or   not 
 at   all.   Lender's 
 decision   not   to 
 exercise   a   particular 
 right   will   not 
 be deemed to   be   Lender's waiver of
the   unexercised right. 

20.                   
  Collection   Expenses. 
 Lender   may   hire 
 or   pay   someone 
 else   to   help 
 collect   on   this note 
 or   recover   the

 when   an Event of   Default occurs.

 court filing fees, court costs,   arbitration fees,

 Except   in   the 
 case   of   notices

  For   Borrower's 
 convenience,   Lender   may 
 permit   Borrower   to 
 provide notices   by   telephone, 
 fax,   or   email. 
 Unless   Lender   behaves recklessly
with regard to   any notice provided to Lender   by
telephone,   fax,   or email, 
 Lender   may rely on the authority of any Person purporting 
 to be a Person   authorized   by Borrower
to give that notice and   Lender will not   be
liable to Borrower or other   Person because of any action taken or not taken 
 by   Lender in   reliance upon any telephonic, 
 facsimile,   or email   notice. Lender's
failure   to receive   written 
 confirmation of any telephonic, facsimile, or   email notice or 
 receipt by   Lender of valid notice   in
accordance with section 22(b) that varies   with   the
provisions understood   by   Lender to 
 be   contained in   any telephonic, 
 facsimile, or email notice will not   affect 
 Borrower's obligation   to repay   the
Term   Loan   or Borrower's performance or observance 
 of   the   provisions of this 
 agreement or the other Loan Documents.  

23.                   
  Waivers   and 
 Amendments.   No   failure 
 or   delay   by 
 Lender   in   exercising 
 any   right or   power 
 under   this   note 
 or under   any   other 
 Loan Document, and   no course of   dealing 
 between Borrower and   Lender, will operate as a waiver of 
 any provision of   this   note 
 or the   other   Loan Documents, 
 nor   will   any 
 single or partial exercise   of   any
such right   or power   or any 
 abandonment or discontinuance of   steps to 
 enforce   such   right 
 or power,   preclude any other or further 
 exercise of those rights   or powers   or
the   exercise of any other right or power   under 
 this note or under this note. No   waiver   of
any provision of   this   note or 
 any   other   Loan Document or consent
to   any   departure by Borrower 
 from those   documents   will 
 be effective unless   the   amendment
or waiver is in writing, signed by   Borrower and 
 Lender, and   any   such waiver or consent
will be effective   only in   the specific instance 
 and   for   the 
 specific purpose for which   given.  

24.                   
  Successors   and 
 Assigns.   (a)   The 
 provisions   of   this 
 note   are   binding 
 upon   and   inure to 
 the   benefit   of 
 Borrower   and   Lender 
 and   their respective successors and assigns. Borrower shall not 
 assign or transfer   any right   or obligation 
 established by this note   without Lender 's prior written consent (which Lender
may withhold   for any   reason). Any attempted
assignment   or transfer in violation of   this
section 24 will be void.  

(b)               
  Lender   may 
 assign   all   or 
 a   portion   of 
 Lender's   rights   and 
 obligations   under this   note 
 and   the   other Loan Documents to one 
 or more assignees.  

25.   Governing   Law.   The 
 laws   of   the 
 State   of   Hawai'i, 
 without   giving   effect 
 to   

 Hawai 
 'i's   principals   of 
 conflicts   of   law, 
 will   govern   interpretation 
 of   this   note 
 and   the   other 
 Loan Documents.

  Jurisdiction.   Borrower

 or   more   federal 
 or   state courts   located in the State
of Hawai'i,   County   of Hawai'i and 
 any   appellate   court in the State
of Hawai'i,   in any action   or proceeding
arising out   this   note,

other   Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement 
 of   any judgment. Borrower   irrevocably
and unconditionally agree   that   all claims 
 with   respect   to 
 any   such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such 
 Hawai 'i state   court   or, to 
 the   extent permitted   by law, federal 
 court.   A final judgment in   any action
or   proceeding   initiated in 
 a permitted court will be   conclusive   and 
 may be enforced in other jurisdictions by   suit on the judgment or 
 in any   other manner provided by law. Nothing in 
 this note   or   any other 
 Loan Document affects any   right   that
Lender may otherwise   have to bring any   action 
 or proceeding relating   to this   note
or any   other Loan   Document 
 against   Borrower any Loan Party in the   courts 
 of any   other jurisdiction.  

27.                   
  V  enue.
  Borrower   irrevocably 
 and   unconditionally   waives, 
 to   the   fullest 
 extent   permitted   by 
 law,   every   past, 
 present,   and   future 
 objection to   the   defense 
 of an inconvenient forum or any   other defense 
 the maintenance   of   any action 
 or proceeding in one or   more federal or 
 state courts   located in the State   of
Hawai'i, County of Hawai'i and any   appellate court in the State 
 of Hawai'i.  

28.                   
  Consent   to 
 Service   of    Process .
 Borrower    irrevocably 
 consents   that   service 
 of   process   for 
 any   action   may 
 be   made in any manner expressly permitted in section 22. Nothing in this 
 note   or in any other   Loan 
 Document affects Lender's   right   to 
 serve process   in any   other manner
permitted   by law.  

29.                   
  Waiver   of 
 Jury   Trial.   Borrower 
 irrevocably   waives,   to 
 the   fullest   extent 
 permitted by   law,   any 
 right   that   Borrower may 
 have   to   a 
 jury trial   in   any 
 proceeding arising   directly or indirectly 
 arising   out of this   note, any
other   Loan Document, or the   transactions 
 contemplated by this   note   or the 
 Loan Documents, regardless   of whether the 
 proceeding is one   of contract, tort,   or
any other   legal theory. Borrower   hereby:  

(1)   Represents 
 that   no   representative, 
 agent, or   attorney   of 
 any   party   has 
 represented,   expressly or   otherwise, 
 that   Lender   would 
 not,   in   the 
 event   of   litigation, 
 seek to   enforce   this 
 waiver; and    

(2)   Acknowledges 
 that   Borrower   was 
 not   induced   to 
 enter   into   this 
 note   by,   among 
 other things,   the   waivers 
 embodied   in   this 
 section   29.    

30.                   
  Entire   Agreement. 
 This   note,   together

Borrower  (i}  acknowledges, admits,
and confirms that  it  does not have any legal right or theory on which
to invoke legal or equitable relief, whether injunctive relief or otherwise, in order to abate, postpone, or terminate enforcement

or equitable relief to cause any such abatement, postponement, or termination of enforcement proceedings.

during the Forbearance Period. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is not intended to set forth all the outstanding
terms, covenants, and agreements between and among the Parties, such that the absence of an express provision herein is not to
