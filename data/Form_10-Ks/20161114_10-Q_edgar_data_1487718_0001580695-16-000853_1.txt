Statements  

  September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Company entered the business of developing,
marketing and distributing various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America with
the merger with U-Vend Canada, Inc. on January 7, 2014. The Company seeks to place its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such
as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. Currently, the Company leases, owns and operates
their kiosks but intends to also provide the kiosks, through a distributor relationship, to the entrepreneur wanting to own their
own business. 

The Company s vending kiosks incorporate
advanced wireless technology, creative concepts, and ease of management. The Company s kiosks have been designed to be tech-savvy
and can be managed on line 24 hours a day/7 days a week, accepting traditional cash input as well as credit and debit cards. Host
locations and suppliers have been drawn to this distribution concept of product vending based on the advantages of reduced labor
and lower product theft as compared to non-kiosk merchandising platforms. The Company takes a solutions development approach for
the marketing of products through a variety of kiosk offerings. The Company s approach to the market can include the addition
of a digital LCD monitor to most makes and models in a kiosk program. This would allow the Company to offer digital advertising
as a national and/or local loop basis and a corresponding additional revenue stream for the Company. 

Management s plans  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company incurred a loss of $2,011,864 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, has incurred accumulated losses totaling $7,839,286, and has a working capital deficit of $2,882,118
at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

To fund the Company s operations
for the next 12 months, to allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a
timely basis the Company needs to raise additional financing. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have
to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing. 

On January 7, 2014, U-Vend, Inc. (formerly
Internet Media Services, Inc. ( IMS )) entered into an Exchange of Securities Agreement with U-Vend Canada, Inc., and
the shareholders of U-Vend Canada, Inc. ( U-Vend Canada ) The Company believes the merger with U-Vend Canada will provide
it with business operations and also working capital. The Company is in discussion to raise additional capital to execute on its
current business plans. There is no assurance that future financing arrangements will be successful or that the operating results
of U-Vend, Inc. will yield sufficient cash flow to execute the Company s business plans or satisfy its obligations. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis of Presentation -   The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and related condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items necessary for their fair presentation in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results expected for a full year. For further
information regarding the Company s accounting policies, please refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and
footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s 10-K annual report filed with the SEC on April 28,
2016. 

The preparation of financial statements,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. 

Principles of Consolidation   -
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of U-Vend, Inc. (formerly Internet Media Services, Inc.),
and the operations of U-Vend America, Inc., U-Vend Canada, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, U-Vend USA LLC. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

6  

Common Shares Issued and Earnings
Per Share   - Common shares issued are recorded based on the value of the shares issued or consideration received, including
cash, services rendered or other non-monetary assets, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company presents basic and diluted
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share reflect the actual weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are computed including the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive
potential shares had been issued. In a loss period, the calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share is considered to be
the same, as the impact of potential common shares is anti-dilutive. 

As of September 30, 2016, there were approximately
54.7 million (44.9 million at September 30, 2015) shares potentially issuable under convertible debt agreements, options,
and warrants that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the Company s losses during the periods presented. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
   -    Financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative
warrant liabilities, promissory notes payable, capital lease obligation, convertible notes payables, and senior convertible notes
payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments, except for derivative warrant
liabilities, convertible notes payable and senior convertible notes payable, since they are short term in nature or they are payable
on demand. The senior convertible notes and the convertible notes payable are recorded at face value net of any unamortized discounts,
based upon the number of underlying convertible shares. The estimated fair value of the convertible notes is determined based on
the trading price on September 30, 2016 since the underlying shares are trading in an active observable market, the fair value
measurement qualifies as a Level 1 input. Certain convertible notes payable are recorded at fair value at September 30, 2016. (See
Note 2). The determination of the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities include unobservable inputs and is therefore
categorized as a Level 3 measurement. Changes in unobservable inputs may result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ASC 820  Fair
Value Measurement  establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;   

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and   

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.   

Reclassifications   -     Certain
prior period amounts in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to current period presentation.
These reclassifications had no effect on the results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented. 

Accounting
Pronouncements   - FASB ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330):  Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory . This ASU requires inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. FASB ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with
prospective application required. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on
the consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting
guidance, ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the
amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. The updated
guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. This guidance is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The guidance requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The
guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early
application is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated
financial statements. 

7  

In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting
standard update ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity
recognizing an asset and liability. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet evaluated nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The standard is
intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification
on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 and the Company is
currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  to clarify two
aspects of Topic 606: (i) identifying performance obligations and (ii) the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the
related principles for those areas. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of this standard will have on the
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OPEN  

The following table provides a summary
of changes in derivative warrant liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The fair value of warrants outstanding
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 has been determined based on the consideration of the enterprise value of the Company,
the limited market of the shares issuable under the agreement and modeling of the Monte Carlo simulation using multiple volatility
assumptions. Warrants issued in and prior to 2012 are significantly out of the money and diluted therefore, management has deemed
the fair value of these to be de minimis. Due to certain unobservable inputs in the fair value calculations of the warrants, derivative
warrant liabilities are classified as Level 3.

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

Certain statements contained herein constitute
 forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the  1995
Reform Act ). U-Vend, Inc. desires to avail itself of certain  safe harbor  provisions of the 1995 Reform Act
and is therefore including this special note to enable us to do so. Except for the historical information contained herein, this
report contains forward-looking statements (identified by the words  estimate,   project,   anticipate, 
 plan,   expect,   intend,   believe,   hope,   strategy 
and similar expressions), which are based on our current expectations and speak only as of the date made. These forward-looking
statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those discussed under Part I, Item 1A
 Risk Factors  in this Annual Report, and those described herein that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements, and the following: 

Our limited operating history with our business model.  

The low cash balance and limited financing currently available to us. We may in the near future have a number of obligations that we will be unable to meet without generating additional income or raising additional capital.  

Further cost reductions or curtailment in future operations due to our low cash balance and negative cash flow.  

Our ability to effect a financing transaction to fund our operations which could adversely affect the value of our stock.  

Our limited cash resources may not be sufficient to fund continuing losses from operations.  

The failure of our products and services to achieve market acceptance.  

The inability to compete in our market, especially against established industry competitors with greater market presence and financial resources.  

The following discussion and analysis provides
information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial
condition and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes that appear elsewhere in this report. 

General  

U-Vend, Inc. was incorporated in March
2007 as a Delaware corporation and herein we refer to the company as  we ,  us , the  Company 
or  U-Vend.  We are headquartered in Santa Monica, California and maintain operations in Ontario, Canada, Chicago,
Illinois, southern California, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Our corporate office is located at 1507 7th Street, #425, Santa Monica, CA
90401 and our telephone number is (800) 467-1496. Our corporate website address is  www.u-vend.com.  Information contained
on our websites is not a part of this interim report. 

Nature of Business  

The Company entered the business of developing,
marketing and distributing various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America with
the merger with U-Vend Canada, Inc. on January 7, 2014. The Company seeks to place its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such
as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. Currently, the Company leases, owns and operates
their kiosks but intends to also provide the kiosks, through a distributor relationship, to the entrepreneur wanting to own their
own business. 

The Company s vending kiosks incorporate
advanced wireless technology, creative concepts, and ease of management. The Company s kiosks have been designed to
be tech-savvy and can be managed on line 24 hours a day/7 days a week, accepting traditional cash input as well as credit and debit
cards. Host locations and suppliers have been drawn to this distribution concept of product vending based on the advantages of
reduced labor and lower product theft as compared to non-kiosk merchandising platforms. The Company takes a solutions development
approach for the marketing of products through a variety of kiosk offerings. The Company s approach to the market includes
the addition of digital LCD monitors to most makes and models of their kiosk program. This would allow the Company to offer digital
advertising as a national and/or local loop basis and a corresponding additional revenue stream for the Company. 

The Company began its current business
efforts with the acquisition of the U-Vend Canada business in January 2014. The business acquired from U-Vend Canada was focused
on the Chicago, Illinois region at the date of the acquisition and has since expanded to include southern California during the
fourth quarter of 2014 and Las Vegas, Nevada in the third quarter of 2015. The Company has a depot and staffing to develop and
service customers in each of these geographic regions. The Company will experience increased expenses with the growth in sales
and number of kiosks in service, both of which increased as the Company executed it business plan. 

In February 2015, the Company announced
entering into an exclusive five year North American sponsorship and licensing agreement with the National Hockey League ( NHL )
for the development, manufacturing and marketing of a novelty ice cream product. The Company has branded the product Frozen Pond
Premium Ice Cream. This is the first consumer product the Company has taken from concept to market and will seek to establish a
wide distribution network for the sale of the product to consumers throughout Canada and the United States. 

13  

In June 2016, the Company entered into
a license agreement beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 with Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. ( MLB ,
 Licensor ) for the non-exclusive right to certain proprietary intangible property of the Licensor to be used in connection
with the manufacturing, distribution, promotion and advertisement of an ice cream novelty product to be sold within the U.S., the
District of Columbia and U.S. territories. 

Management s plans  

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company incurred a loss of $2,011,864 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, has accumulated losses totaling $7,839,286, and has a working capital deficit of $2,882,118 at September
30, 2016. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

To fund the Company s operations
for the next 12 months, to allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a
timely basis, the Company needs to raise additional financing. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have
to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing. 

On January 7, 2014, U-Vend, Inc., formerly
Internet Media Services, Inc. ( IMS ) entered into an Exchange of Securities Agreement with U-Vend Canada, Inc., and
the stockholders of U-Vend Canada, Inc. ( U-Vend Canada ). The Company believes the merger with U-Vend Canada will
provide it with business operations and also working capital. The Company is in discussion to raise additional capital to execute
on its current business plans. There is no assurance that future financing arrangements will be successful or that the operating
results of U-Vend, Inc. will yield sufficient cash flow to execute the Company s business plans or satisfy its obligations.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Results of Operations: For the Three and Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

Revenues:  

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 the Company s revenues increased by $139,576 or 50.7% to $414,842 compared to revenues of $275,266 during the three
months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s revenues increased by $465,387
or 74.5% to $1,089,865 during the comparable period in 2015. The increases in revenues were due to additional electronic kiosks
installed and operational during 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 140 electronic kiosks installed and operational
in Greater Chicago, Illinois, southern California and Las Vegas, Nevada compared to 118 at September 30, 2015. A substantial number
of kiosks were installed in the first quarter of 2015 and the benefit of a full operational of these kiosks was realized in 2016. 

Cost of Revenues:  

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company s cost of revenues increased by $17,705 or 9.4% to $205,404 compared to cost of revenues of $187,699 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s cost of revenues increased
by $124,926 or 31.0% to $527,894 compared to cost of revenues of $402,968 during the comparable period in 2015. The increase in
cost of revenues in 2016 was due to higher revenues generated by the Company in 2016 compared to 2015. The Company s cost
of revenues as a percentage of revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 49.5% and 48.4%, respectively,
compared to 68.2% and 64.5%, respectively, in 2015. 

Selling Expenses:  

Selling expenses for three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $184,440 and $430,528 compared to the comparable period in 2015. Selling expenses
increased, in part, due to increased revenues attained by the Company during 2016 resulting in increases in selling expenses such
as commissions paid to host locations where the Company s kiosks are based. In addition, during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company accrued or expensed $475,843 for sponsorship and media commitment fees in connection with the NHL Corporate
Marketing Agreement and MLB compared to $230,004 during the comparable period in 2015. 

General and Administrative Expenses:  

General and Administrative expenses for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $57,944 and $106,662, respectively, compared to the comparable
period in 2015. Increased levels of operations and revenues in 2016 resulted in increases in support costs including compensation,
revenue based incentives and travel expenses. However the increases were offset by decreases in professional fees and merger related
expenses compared to costs incurred in 2015. 

14  

Reversal of earn-out liability:  

The Company had estimated the earn-out liability pursuant to
its merger agreement U-Vend Canada. The Company paid part of the liability through issuance of 2,261,425 common shares. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company determined that it is unlikely that there will be additional earn-out payments
since the revenue targets stipulated for the earn-out will not be achieved. Accordingly, the Company reversed the liability for
contingent consideration in the amount of $201,013, resulting in non-cash operating income reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated Statement of Operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Change in fair value of debt and warrant
liabilities:  

The Company evaluates financial
instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
Certain warrants the Company has issued have a  down round provision  as a result the warrants are classified as
derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities,
the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued at each reporting date with any
change in fair value reported in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the amount of $11,486
and $119,671, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recognized a gain on the
change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the amount of $32,042 and $67,743, respectively. 

Amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs:  

Amortization of debt discount and deferred
financing costs increased by $170,494 from ($333) during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $170,161 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. For nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discount and deferred financing
costs increased by $191,548 compared to comparable period in 2015. The increase in debt discount and deferred financing costs were
due to additional interest, expenses, fine and penalties of $95,844 arising from Senior Convertible Notes and 2016 SPA notes issuance
charged as debt discount and deferred financing costs in 2016. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, Company charged to operations as amortization of deferred financing costs $150,00 incurred for a proposed financing as the
Company determined that it is unlikely that the proposed financing will be completed. 

Interest expense:  

Interest expense for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased by $16,086 and $10,926, respectively over the comparable period in 2015. The increases were due to
higher levels of borrowings the Company had in 2016. 

Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign currency:  

The Company had two convertible notes payable
in Canadian dollars that were acquired in connection with the U-Vend Canada merger on January 7, 2014.  During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on foreign currency related to these notes and
the related accrued interest of $1,776. For the the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a unrealized loss
of $7,251. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on foreign currency
translation of $8,602 and, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on foreign currency translation of $24,561, respectively, related
to these notes and the accrued interest.  

Net Loss:  

As a result of the foregoing, the net loss
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $953,514 compared to a net loss of $619,039 during the three months ended September
30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net loss was $2,011,864 compared to a net loss of $1,431,764 in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
a working capital deficiency of $2,882,118 compared to working capital deficiency of approximately $2,914,000 at
December 31, 2015. The decrease in the working capital deficiency is primarily due to the refinancing short term debt with long
term debt pursuant to Senior Convertible Notes and 2016 SPA Notes issuance but the decrease was offset by Company s operating
losses during the nine months September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s operating
activities used cash of approximately $496,000 compared to approximately $434,000 used during the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company s operations, after adjusting for non-cash items, used approximately $1,429,000 of cash. Changes in

nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s operations, after adjustment for non-cash items, used approximately $1,119,000
of cash and working capital items provided approximately $685,000 of cash. 

15

on December 31, 2017 and can be convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price $.05 per share. The Company determined
that the Senior Convertible Note had beneficial conversion and allocated $87,043 as debt discount representing the beneficial conversion.
The Company will amortize the debt the discount over the term of the note. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company repaid one convertible note payable in Canadian dollars that were acquired in connection with the U-Vend
Canada merger on January 7, 2014 in the face amount of $19,250. 

On June 30, 2016, the Company issued five
Convertible Notes in the aggregate face amount of $761,597 pursuant to 2016 Stock Purchase Agreement (2016 SPA). 2016 SPA Notes
are due in 24 months and bear interest at 9.5% and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.17 per
share. The Company satisfied its obligations for: previously issued Promissory Notes of $549,000, accrued interest of $38,615,

ended September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, aggregate principal
amounts of approximately $237,000 are due for repayment pursuant to the terms of the related notes. The Company is in discussion
with the note holders for an extension of the repayment date. However, as of November 4, 2016 no agreement has been reached. There
is no assurance that an acceptable extension agreement will be reached. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company incurred a loss of $2,011,864 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, has accumulated losses totaling $7,839,286, and has a working capital deficit of $2,882,118 at September
30, 2016. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

To fund the Company s operations
for the next 12 months, to allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a
timely basis the Company needs to raise additional financing. Should additional financing not be available the Company will have
to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, an effect on our financial condition, financial statements, revenues or expenses. 

Inflation  

Although our operations are influenced
by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the
last three years as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers, or absorb them
as we improve the efficiency of our operations. 

16  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements
and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 describe the significant accounting policies and methods used
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and be based on events
different from those assumptions. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; estimating therefore, requires
the exercise of judgment. Thus, accounting estimates change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired or as additional
information is obtained. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Financial instruments include cash, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative warrant liabilities, promissory notes payable, capital lease obligations,
convertible notes payables, and senior convertible notes payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these
financial instruments, except for derivative warrant liabilities, convertible notes payable and senior convertible notes payable,
since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable or payable on demand.
The convertible notes payable are recorded at face amount, net of any unamortized discounts based on the underlying shares the
notes can be converted into. The estimated fair value of the convertible notes is determined based on the trading price on September
30, 2016, since the underlying shares are trading in an active, observable market, the fair value measurement qualifies as a Level
1 input. The determination of the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities include unobservable inputs and is therefore
categorized as a Level 3 measurement. 

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. FASB ASC 820  Fair Value Measurement  establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;  

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and  

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We do not use derivative instruments to
hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such
instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Certain warrants the Company has issued have
a  down round provision.  As a result, the warrants are classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. 

For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued
at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The methodology for valuing
our outstanding warrants classified as derivative instruments was determined based on the consideration of the enterprise value
of the Company, the limited market of the shares issuable under the agreement and modeling of the Monte Carlo simulation using
multiple volatility assumptions. A financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The warrant liability is measured at fair value using
certain estimated factors such as volatility and probability which are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Significant
unobservable inputs are used in the fair value measurement of the Company s derivative warrant liabilities include impact
of dilution and volatility. Significant increases (decreases) in the volatility input would result in a significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement. 

Share-Based Payments  

We record our common shares issued based
on the value of the shares issued or consideration received, including cash, services rendered or other non-monetary assets, whichever
is more readily determinable. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC 718  Stock
Compensation.  This statement requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the period in which the employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is usually the vesting period. In accordance with FASB ASC 505
 Equity , the measurement date for the non-forfeitable awards to nonemployees that vest immediately is the date the
award is issued. 

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  

The Company maintains disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s chief executive officer also acting as chief
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

17  

Our chief executive officer also acting
as chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures 
(as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered
by this quarterly report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that material weaknesses
described in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 exist in our internal control over financial reporting based
on the evaluation of these controls and procedures as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. 

To address the material weaknesses we performed
additional analyses and other post-closing procedures and retained the services of a consultant to ensure that our condensed consolidated
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP). Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows for
the periods presented. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting:  

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
