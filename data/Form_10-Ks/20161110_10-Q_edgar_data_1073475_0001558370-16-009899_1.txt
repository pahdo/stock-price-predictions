Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Citizens First Corporation (the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens First Bank, Inc. (the  Bank ), conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and general practices within the banking industry.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Bank.  All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted.  These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are based on various factors including the current interest rate environment and the general strength of the local economy.  Changes in the overall interest rate environment can significantly affect the Company s net interest income and the value of its recorded assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements.  Those adjustments consist only of normal recurring adjustments. Results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.     

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2014 the FASB amended existing guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. This amendment supersedes and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model, changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics and expands and improves disclosures about revenue. In addition, this amendment specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent.  The amendments in this update affect this guidance issued in 2014 that is not yet effective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 which amends existing guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  This new standard revises and entity s accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 which establishes the principles to report information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases.  This new standard changes the way operating leases are account for and reflected on the lessee s balance sheet.  The new standard is intended to increase transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to recognize the financial obligation and right-of-use asset associated with operating leases that have a lease term of more than 12 months on the balance sheet.  The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 which provides guidance on share-based payment accounting.  The new standard includes multiple provision intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments.  The

Table of Contents  

new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model and replaces the incurred loss model.  The most significant impact for financial institutions will be to the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).  The standard allows for various expected credit loss estimation methods and is scalable.  This standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2 - Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial statements of prior periods to conform to the current period presentation.  These reclassifications do not affect net income or total stockholders  equity as previously reported. 

Note 3 - Available-For-Sale Securities 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income: 

10 

Table of Contents  

The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity were as follows.  Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, are shown separately. 

The following table summarizes the investment securities with unrealized losses by portfolio segment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in continuous unrealized loss position: 

Other-Than-Temporary-Impairment 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.  Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are generally evaluated for OTTI under ASC Topic 320,  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.  

In determining OTTI under the ASC Topic 320 model, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 

All rated securities are investment grade.  For those that are not rated, the financial condition has been evaluated and no adverse conditions were identified related to repayment.  Declines in fair value are a function of rate differences in the   

11 

Table of Contents  

market and market illiquidity.  The Company does not intend or is not expected to be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

All of the Company s unrealized losses 12 months or more relate to its investment in a single trust preferred security.  The security is a single-issuer trust preferred that is not rated.  No impairment charge is being taken as no loss of principal or interest is anticipated.  All principal and interest payments are being received as scheduled.  On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer, a bank holding company with operations in the state of Kentucky.  Based on the issuer s continued profitability and well-capitalized position, we do not deem that there is credit loss.  The decline in fair value is primarily attributable to illiquidity affecting these markets and not the expected cash flows of the individual securities.  We have evaluated the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and expect to fully recover our cost basis.  This security continues to pay interest as agreed and future payments are expected to be made as agreed.  This security is not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 

Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses 

Categories of loans include: 

The following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the three months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Table of Contents  

The following tables present the aging of the recorded investment in past due loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by class of loans.  Non-accrual loans are included and have been categorized based on their payment status: 

Troubled Debt Restructurings: 

The Company reported total troubled debt restructurings of $2.4 million and $2.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company has no commitments to lend additional amounts to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings.  Troubled debt restructurings are included in impaired loans. The modifications of the terms of these loans included reducing the interest rate, granting an interest only payment period, or extending the terms of the debt for customers experiencing financial difficulties. Of the 12 troubled debt restructurings reported at quarter end, all loans were on accrual status.   

16 

Table of Contents  

There were no troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the three months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The following table presents loans by class modified as troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Specific allocations of $228,000 and $267,000 were reported for troubled debt restructurings as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. No payment defaults or charge-offs were reported for troubled debt restructuring during  the three months ending September 30, 2016, and one troubled debt restructuring totaling $3,000 was charged off in the nine months ending September 30, 2016. No payment defaults or charge-offs were reported for troubled debt restructurings during the three and nine months ending September 30, 2015.  

The terms of certain other loans were modified during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 that did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring. These loans modified during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 have a total recorded investment of $25.6 million as of September 30, 2016. These loans modified during the nine months ending September 30, 2015 had a total recorded investment of $19.2 million as of September 30, 2015. The modification of these loans involved either a modification of the terms of a loan to borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulties or a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant. 

In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting policy. 

Credit Quality Indicators: 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk.  This analysis includes commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance greater than $25 thousand and is reviewed on a monthly basis. For residential real estate and consumer loans the analysis primarily involves monitoring the past due status of these loans and at such time that these loans are past due, the Company evaluates the loans to determine if a change in risk category is warranted. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Special Mention.  Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. 

Substandard.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful.  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

17 

Table of Contents  

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be Pass rated loans.  All loans in all loan categories are assigned risk ratings.  Based on the most recent analyses performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows: 

Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2   Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, reflect a company s own assumptions about market participant assumptions of fair value, and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

In determining the appropriate levels, the Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each     type of financial instrument: 

Investment Securities: The fair value of securities available-for-sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (level 2 inputs).  The Company does   

18 

Table of Contents  

not have any Level 1 securities.  Level 2 securities include certain U.S. agency bonds, collateralized mortgage and debt obligations, and certain municipal securities. The Company also has one Level 3 security. The value of this single issue trust preferred security is obtained on a quarterly basis directly from the originating broker. 

Impaired Loans: The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.  Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 

Other Real Estate Owned: Commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value, less costs to sell.  Fair values are based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may use a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.  Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 

Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans and real estate properties classified as other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by Bank management.  The appraisal values for collateral-dependent impaired loans are discounted to allow for selling expenses and fees, the limited use nature of various properties, the age of the most recent appraisal, and additional discretionary discounts for location, condition, etc. The Bank annually obtains an updated current appraisal value for each OREO property to certify that the fair value has not declined.  For each parcel of OREO that has declined in value, the Bank records the decline in value by a direct writedown of the asset.   

Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Table of Contents  

The table below presents a reconciliation of all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30: 

Impaired loans which are measured for impairment using the fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a principal balance of $148,000 at September 30, 2016 with a valuation allowance of $107,000.  Impaired loans which were measured for impairment using the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans had a principal balance of $537,000 at December 31, 2015, with a valuation allowance of $198,000.  Increases in the provision for loan losses of $107,000 and $260,000 were recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of net changes in fair values on collateral dependent loans and other factors affecting the provision for loan losses. 

Other real estate owned, which is measured at fair value less costs to sell, had a net carrying value of $0 at September 30, 2016 and $100,000 at December 31, 2015.  Total writedowns of other real estate owned were $0 and $27,000 in the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The following table presents quantitative and qualitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2016. There was no other real estate owned as of September 30, 2016.

The carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows: 

(a) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.      

(b) 

Interest Bearing Deposits in Other Financial Institutions: Fair values are based on quoted market prices.     

(c) 

FHLB Stock: It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.      

(d) 

Loans: Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. The fair value

Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. The carrying amounts of variable rate certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 2 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.

Note 6 - Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share have been computed by dividing net income available for common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share have been computed the same as basic earnings per share, and assumes the conversion of outstanding stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants, if dilutive.  The following table reconciles the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Table of Contents  

Stock options for 26,571 shares of common stock were not considered in computing diluted earnings per common share for September 30, 2015 because they are anti-dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive stock options at September 30, 2016. 

Note 7 - Regulatory Capital Matters 

Banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies.  Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators.  Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action.  Management believes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and Citizens First Bank, Inc. met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 

Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition.  If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits.  If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required.  The most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category. 

Under quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy, we are required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and to total assets. For 2016, interim Final Basel III rules require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets. Under Basel III rules, the decision was made to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in computing regulatory capital. The rules also established a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5%, to be phased in through January 1, 2019, above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. The buffer is 0.625% as of September 30, 2016.  The buffer could limit the payment of dividends and discretionary bonuses to officers if a bank fails to maintain required capital levels.

Note 8 - Preferred Stock 

In 2004, the Company issued 250 shares of Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, stated value $31,992 per share (Cumulative Preferred Stock), for an aggregate purchase price of $7,998,000. The Cumulative Preferred Stock was sold for $31,992 per share, is entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends at an annual fixed rate of 6.5% and is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at an initial conversion price per share of $15.50 (currently $14.06, adjusted for stock dividends) on and after three years after the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2016, 13 preferred shares have converted to 29,575 common shares.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysi  s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management s discussion and analysis of Citizens First Corporation (the  Company ) is included to provide the shareholders with an expanded narrative of our results of operations, changes in financial condition, liquidity and capital adequacy.  This narrative should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

We may from time to time make written or oral statements, including statements contained in this report, which may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).  The words  may ,  expect ,  anticipate ,  intend ,  consider ,  plan ,  believe ,  seek ,  should ,  estimate , and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but other statements may constitute forward-looking statements.  These statements should be considered subject to various risks and uncertainties.  Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management s belief as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management pursuant to  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.  Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially are current and future economic conditions generally and in our market areas, changes in the interest rate environment, overall loan demand, increased competition in the financial services industry which could negatively impact our ability to increase total earning assets, and retention of key personnel.  Actions by the Department of the Treasury and federal and state bank regulators in response to changing economic conditions, changes in interest rates, loan prepayments by and the financial health of our borrowers, and other factors described in the reports filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission could also impact current expectations. 

Results of Operations 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we reported net income of $1.14 million or $0.45 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $775,000, or $0.31 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $360,000.  The increase in net income is attributable to a reduction in non-interest expenses of $385,000, combined with an increase in net interest income of $165,000.  The reduction in non-interest expense is related to a branch disposal loss of $262,000 that occurred in 2015, and a reduction in professional fees of $85,000.  The increase in net interest income is the result of an increase in earning assets over the prior year, primarily loans. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported net income of $3.11 million or $1.23 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $2.46 million, or $0.95 per diluted common share in the previous year. This represents an increase of $658,000, or $0.28 per share. The increase in net income is attributable to a reduction in the provision for loan losses of $285,000, combined with an increase in net interest income of $487,000, and a decrease in non-interest expenses of $167,000.  The increase in net interest income is the result of an increase in earning assets over the prior year, primarily loans. 

Our annualized return on average assets, defined as net income divided by average assets, was 1.02% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.72% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The annualized return on average assets was 0.95% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.76% in September 30, 2015.  Our annualized return on average equity, defined as net income divided by average equity, was 10.75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 7.97% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Our annualized return on average equity was 10.14% for the nine months ending September 30, 2016, compared to 8.51% for the nine months ending September 30, 2015.  

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund these assets.  Factors that influence the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, yields earned and rates paid, the level of non-performing loans and non-earning assets, and the amount of non-interest bearing deposits supporting earning assets.   

25 

Table of Contents  

Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $165,000, or 4.4%, compared to September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income was a result of an increase in the volume of average earning assets over the previous year. 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $487,000 or 4.3%, compared to September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income was a result of an increase in the volume of average earning assets over the previous year. 

The Company s net interest margin was 3.83% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 3.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 1 basis point.  The net interest margin decreased due to a decline in the yield on loans.  The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.89%, compared to 3.84% in 2015.  The increase of 5 basis points is attributable to both a decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the yield on earning assets.  

The following tables set forth for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities and average yields and costs.  Such yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented.

Provision for Loan Losses 

There was no provision for loan losses recorded for the third quarter of 2016 or for the third quarter of 2015. The allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.45% of total loans at September 30, 2016 compared to 1.53% at September 30, 2015. Net charge-offs (recoveries) were ($12,000) for the third quarter of 2016 compared to ($38,000) in the third quarter of 2015. 

(Credit) provision expense for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 decreased $285,000, from $200,000 to ($85,000). Net charge-offs (recoveries) were ($130,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $64,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $12,000, or 1.4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to gain on the sale of mortgage loans. 

Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $103,000, or 4.4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to gains on sale of securities and gains on sale of mortgage loans, offset by a decline in lease income and non-deposit brokerage fees. 

Non-Interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $385,000, or 10.9%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a branch disposal loss of $262,000 that occurred in 2015, and a reduction in professional fees of $85,000. 

Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $167,000, or 1.7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to branch disposal losses of $235,000 and professional fees of $119,000, partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses, which were a result of normal salary adjustments.

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was calculated using our expected effective rate for 2016 and 2015.  We have recognized deferred tax liabilities and assets to show the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Our statutory federal tax rate was 34.0% in both 2016 and 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 30.2% compared to a 27.1% effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015. The difference between the statutory and effective rates are impacted by such factors as income from tax-exempt loans, tax-exempt income on state and municipal securities, and income on bank owned life insurance. 

Balance Sheet Review 

Overview 

Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $441.7 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 2.2%, from $432.2 million at December 31, 2015.  Average assets during the third quarter were $442.0 million, an increase of 3.2%, or $13.7 million, from $428.3 million in the third quarter of 2015.  Average interest earning assets increased 4.4%, or $17.6 million, from $397.0 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $414.6 million in the third quarter of 2016. 

Loans 

Loans increased $12.4 million, or 3.75%, from $330.8 million at December 31, 2015 to $ 343.2 million at September 30, 2016.  Total loans averaged $344.7 million the third quarter of 2016, compared to $319.1 million the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $25.6 million, or 8.02%.  We experienced an increase in the commercial real estate portfolio during the first nine months of the year compared to December 31, 2015. The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio by category: 

The majority of our loans are to customers located in south central Kentucky and central Tennessee.  As of September 30, 2016, our twenty largest credit relationships consisted of loans and loan commitments ranging from $3.9 million to $11.3 million.  The aggregate amount of these credit relationships was $113.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our twenty largest credit relationships consisted of loans and loan commitments ranging from $3.8 million to $6.6 million.  The aggregate amount of these credit relationships was $95.9 million. 

Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state and federal law.  Citizens First Bank s secured legal lending limit to a single borrower was approximately $12.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $17.0 million of participations in loans purchased from, and $20.7 million of participations in loans sold to, other banks. As of December 31, 2015, we had $21.1 million of participations in loans purchased from, and $21.8 million of participations in loans sold to, other banks.

Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth the maturity distribution of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016.  Maturities are based on contractual terms.  Our policy is to specifically review and approve all loans renewed; loans are not automatically rolled over. 

Credit Quality and the     Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. 

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated.  This allocation is not intended to suggest how actual losses may occur. 

We maintain a modest unallocated amount in the allowance to assist in mitigating inherent risk that cannot be quantitatively or qualitatively determined, including, but not limited to, new loan products and new markets for which insufficient history exists for a robust analysis.  Allocations on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. The unallocated portion of the allowance was $72,000 at September 30, 2016 and $121,000 at December 31, 2015. 

31 

Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth selected asset quality measurements and ratios for the periods indicated: 

Non-performing assets totaled $156,000 at September 30 2016, compared to $637,000 at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $481,000. Payoffs and paydowns of $637,000 included the charge off of $73,000 in principal deficiency balances after the disposition of collateral and the sale of $100,000 in other real estate owned, with decreases offset by the addition of $57,000 in residential real estate loans and $100,000 in commercial and agricultural loans.  

Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Non-performing assets are defined as non-performing loans, other real estate owned, and repossessed assets. Management classifies commercial and commercial real estate loans as non-accrual when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and the loan is not adequately collateralized, or earlier when, in the opinion of management, principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation. We charge off consumer loans after 120 days of delinquency unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans are not reclassified as accruing until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear reasonably certain. 

Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered TDRs when the concession provided is not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. Our standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other factors, minimum verified income requirements, cash flow analysis, and collateral valuations. However, each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the loan are modified to meet a borrower s specific circumstances at a point in time. TDRs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. Non-accrual TDRs are included in non-accrual loans whereas accruing TDRs are excluded because the borrower remains contractually current.  

Loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review. Where appropriate, allocations for individual loans are included in the allowance calculation based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flow and legal options available to us.  Included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in ASC Topic 310  Receivables . We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.  Historical loss rates are applied to other loans not subject to individual allocations.  These historical loss rates may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition.  Factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies, trends in the nature and volume of loans (delinquencies, charge-offs and non-accrual loans), changes in mix, asset quality trends, risk management and loan administration, changes in internal lending policies and credit standards, and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and our internal credit examiners. 

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt   

32 

Table of Contents  

restructurings and classified as impaired.  Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.  Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all loan classes by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.   

Securities 

The investment securities portfolio is comprised of U.S. Government agency and government sponsored entity securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, tax-exempt securities of states and political subdivisions, a taxable municipal security, a corporate bond, and a trust preferred security. The purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is a part of managing our effective tax rate.  Securities are all classified as available-for-sale, and averaged $59.0 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $58.7 million for 2015. 

The tables below present the maturities and yield characteristics of securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The trust preferred security category consists of one single issue trust preferred security which has experienced a decline in fair value due to inactivity in the market. No impairment charge is being taken as no loss of principal is anticipated and all principal and interest payments are being received as scheduled. The Company does not intend to sell this security and does not believe it will be required to sell this security before recovery. All rated securities are investment grade. For those that are not rated, the financial condition has been evaluated and no adverse conditions were identified related to repayment. Declines in fair value are a function of rate changes in the market and market illiquidity.  

Deposits 

Our primary funding source for lending and investment activities results from customer deposits and a deposit listing service.  Deposits at September 30, 2016 were $353.8 million, a decrease of $16.6 million, or 4.5%, compared to $370.4 million at December 31, 2015.  Total deposits averaged $355.0 million the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $11.6 million, or 3.2%, compared to $366.6 million during the third quarter of 2015.   

Time deposits that meets or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 were $11.2 million and $11.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $62.8 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $73.4 million at December 31, 2015.  Interest expense on time deposits of $100,000 or more was $569,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $615,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our cost has decreased as these certificates of deposit matured and were renewed at lower current market rates.  The following table shows the maturities of time deposits as of September 30, 2016.  

Borrowings 

FHLB Advances.   We obtain advances from the Federal Home Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) for funding and liability management.  These advances are collateralized by a blanket agreement of eligible 1-4 family residential mortgage loans

Table of Contents  

and eligible commercial real estate. Total advances as of September 30, 2016 were $38.0 million compared to $13.0 million at December 31, 2015. Rates vary based on the term to repayment, and are summarized below as of September 30, 2016: 

At September 30, 2016, we had available collateral to borrow an additional $37.3 million from the FHLB compared to $63.5 million at December 31, 2015. 

Other Borrowings.    In 2015, we renewed a credit agreement with a community bank to be used for operating capital and general corporate purposes.  The line has a total availability of $3.0 million, matures November 21, 2016, and bears interest at the prime rate as published in the Money Rates section of   The Wall Street Journal  , plus 0.25%, with interest payable monthly. The line has a floor rate of 4.5%. The line is secured by the Bank s common stock.  As of September 30, 2016 there was no balance on the line compared to a balance of $2.0 million at December 31, 2015.  

At September 30, 2016, we had established Federal Funds lines of credit totaling $18.8 million with three correspondent banks.  No amounts were drawn as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

We issued $5.0 million in subordinated debentures in October, 2006.  These trust preferred securities bear an interest rate, which reprices each calendar quarter, of 165 basis points over 3-month LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offering Rate).  Our rate as of September 30, 2016 was 2.30%.  The subordinated debentures may be included with tier 1 capital (with certain limitations) under current regulatory guidelines. 

Liquidity 

Our objective for liquidity management is to ensure that we have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability.  In order to maintain a proper level of liquidity, the Bank has several sources of funds available on a daily basis that can be used for liquidity purposes. Those sources of funds include the Bank s core deposits, cash flow generated by repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities; FHLB borrowings; and federal funds purchased. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds, deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition in our local markets. 

Our asset and liability management committee meets monthly and monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity.  We prepare a monthly cash flow report which forecasts funding needs and availability for the coming months, based on forecasts of loan closings and payoffs, potentially callable securities, and other factors.

Stockholders  equity increased to $42.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $39.5 million at December 31, 2015.  The book value per common share improved to $17.56 at September 30, 2016 compared to $16.18 at December 31, 2015.  The Company has paid $0.08 per share in common dividends year-to-date in 2016, and declared a dividend of $0.08 per share in October, 2016 to be paid in November, 2016. 

The Company previously issued 250 shares of Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, (Preferred Stock), for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. The Preferred Stock was sold for $31,992 per share, is entitled to quarterly cumulative

dividends at an annual fixed rate of 6.5% and is currently convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at an initial conversion price per share of $15.50 (currently $14.06, adjusted for stock dividends).  Approximately 5% of preferred shareholders (holding 13 shares of Preferred Stock) have converted their shares into 29,575 shares of common stock as of September 30, 2016. 

We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies.  Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators.  Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action.  The final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks, (Basel III rules) became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The rules also established a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5%, to be phased in over three years, above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. The buffer as of September 30, 2016 is 0.625%.  The buffer could limit the payment of dividends and discretionary bonuses to officers if a bank fails to maintain required capital levels. The net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. We believe as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

Our capital ratios, calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines, were as follows:

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure  s about Market Risk 

We use a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure.  The model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates over future time periods.  Forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires us to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes, including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities.  Other assumptions include, but are not limited to, projected prepayments, projected new volume, and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances.  These effects are combined with our estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast of net interest income and net income.  The forecasted results are then adjusted for the effect of a gradual increase and decrease in market interest rates on our net interest income and net income.  Because assumptions are inherently uncertain, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income.  Actual results could differ significantly from simulated results. 

At September 30, 2016, the model indicated that if rates were to increase by 200 basis points during the remainder of the calendar year, then net interest income would increase 8.20% over the next twelve months.  The model indicated that if rates were to decrease by 200 basis points over the same period, then net interest income would decrease .69%.  The table below notes the projected changes in net interest income as indicated by the model for increases in rates up to 400 basis points and decreases in rates to 200 basis points.
