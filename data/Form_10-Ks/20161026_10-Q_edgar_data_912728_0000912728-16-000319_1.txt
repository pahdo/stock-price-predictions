1.    Basis of Presentation 
    
  Forward Air Corporation's ( the Company ,  We ,  Our ) services can be classified into   four   principal reportable segments: Expedited LTL, Expedited Truckload Services ( TLX ), Intermodal and Pool Distribution (See note 11). 
    
  In our Expedited LTL segment, we provide time-definite transportation services to the North American deferred air freight market. Our Expedited LTL service operates a comprehensive national network for the time-definite surface transportation of expedited ground freight. The Expedited LTL service offers customers local pick-up and delivery and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective, reliable alternative to air transportation. Expedited LTL s other services include shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage, and other handling. The Expedited LTL segment primarily provides its transportation services through a network of terminals located at or near airports in the United States and Canada. 
    
  In our TLX segment, we provide expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services and maximum security and temperature-controlled logistics services. We are able to expedite this service by utilizing a dedicated fleet of team owner operators, some team company drivers as well as third party transportation providers. The TLX segment provides full truckload service in the United States and Canada.   
    
  In our Intermodal segment, we provide container and intermodal drayage services primarily within the Midwest region of the United States. Drayage is essentially the first and last mile of the movement of an intermodal container. We are providing this service both to and from ports and rail heads. Our Intermodal segment also provides dedicated contract and Container Freight Station ( CFS ) warehouse and handling services. Today Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest but through acquisition as well as green-field start-ups we anticipate moving into other geographies within the United States. 
    
  In our Pool Distribution segment, we provide pool distribution services throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest continental United States. Pool distribution involves managing high-frequency handling and distribution of time-sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions. Our primary customers for this service are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers, such as mall, strip mall and outlet based retail chains.  
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The Company s operating results are subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis; therefore operating results for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Forward Air Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include Forward Air Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

2.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital (APIC) pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. The guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this guidance in January 2017 and while the elimination of APIC pools will result in increased volatility of our effective tax rate, the overall impact is expected to be minimal.

  (Unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016 

In February 2016, the FASB, issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes", an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes ( Update ). Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The FASB also decided to permit earlier application by all entities as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. The FASB further provides that this Update may be applied to all deferred tax liabilities and assets retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted the Update retrospectively for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 

3.    Acquisitions and Goodwill 
    
  Acquisition of Towne 
    
  On March 9, 2015, the Company acquired CLP Towne Inc. ( Towne ) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) resulting in Towne becoming an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.   For the acquisition of Towne, the Company paid   $61,878   in net cash and assumed   $59,544   in debt and capital leases.  With the exception of assumed capital leases, the assumed debt was immediately paid in full after funding of the acquisition.  Of the total aggregate cash consideration paid,   $16,500   was placed into an escrow account, with   $2,000   of such amount being available to settle any shortfall in Towne s net working capital and with   $14,500   of such amount being available for a period of time to settle certain possible claims against Towne s common stockholders for indemnification. To the extent the escrow fund is insufficient, certain equity holders have agreed to indemnify Forward Air, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, as a result of inaccuracies in or breaches of certain of Towne s representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and other matters. Forward Air financed the Merger Agreement with a   $125,000     2 year   term loan available under the senior credit facility discussed in note 5.   
    
  Towne is a full-service trucking provider offering time-sensitive less-than-truckload shipping, full truckload service, an extensive cartage network, container freight stations and dedicated trucking. Towne s airport-to-airport network provides scheduled deliveries to   61   service points. A fleet of approximately   525   independent contractor tractors provides the line-haul between those service points.  The acquisition of Towne provides the Expedited LTL and TLX segments with opportunities to expand their service points and service offerings, such as pick up and delivery services.  Additional benefits of the acquisition include increased linehaul network shipping density and a significant increase to our owner operator fleet, both of which are key to the profitability of the Company. 
    
  The assets, liabilities, and operating results of Towne have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Expedited LTL and TLX reportable segments.  As the operations of Towne

were fully integrated into the Company's existing networks and operations, the Company is not able to provide the revenue and operating results from Towne included in our consolidated revenue and results since the date of acquisition. 
  Effective with the acquisition of Towne, the Company immediately entered into a restructuring plan to remove duplicate costs, primarily in the form of, but not limited to salaries, wages and benefits and facility leases.  As a result of these plans, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recognized expense and recorded liabilities of   $2,588   and   $11,290   for severance obligations and remaining net payments on vacated, duplicate facilities, respectively.  The expenses associated with the severance obligations and vacated, duplicate facilities were recognized in the salaries, wages and benefits and operating lease line items, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company also incurred expense of   $9,059   for various other integration and transaction related costs which are largely included in other operating expenses. 
  In conjunction with the Towne acquisition, the Company vacated certain duplicate facilities under long-term non-cancelable leases and recorded contract termination costs. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's reserve for remaining payments on vacated facilities was   $4,775  . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid   $700   and   $3,862   respectively in recurring payments on these non-cancelable leases.   
  Acquisition of Triumph and Ace 
    
  As part of the Company's strategy to expand its Intermodal operations, in August 2016, we acquired certain assets of Triumph Transport, Inc. and Triumph Repair Service, Inc. (together referred to as  Triumph ) for   $10,100   and a potential earnout of   $1,250  .  The assets, liabilities, and operating results of Triumph have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Intermodal reportable segment.  
  In January 2016, the Company also acquired certain assets of Ace Cargo, LLC ("Ace") for   $1,700  .  The assets, liabilities, and operating results of Ace have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Intermodal reportable segment.  
  Allocations of Purchase Prices 
  The following table presents the allocations of the Towne, Triumph and Ace purchase prices to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values and resulting residual goodwill (in thousands):

The acquired definite-live intangible assets have the following useful lives:

    - 

The fair value of the non-compete agreements and customer relationships assets were estimated using an income approach (level 3). Under this method, an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To estimate fair value, the Company used cash flows discounted at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each type of asset. The Company believes that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions.  Cash flows were assumed to extend through the remaining economic useful life of each class of intangible asset. 
  Pro forma 
  The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the Company's consolidated results of operations as if the Towne acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2015 (in thousands, except per share data).

The unaudited pro forma consolidated results for the nine month periods are based on the historical financial information of Towne. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results incorporate historical financial information since January 1, 2015. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are: (i) directly attributable to the acquisition, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the Company s consolidated results of operations actually would have been had it completed these acquisitions on January 1, 2015. 
  Goodwill 
  The Company conducted its annual impairment assessments and tests of goodwill for each reporting unit as of June 30, 2016.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test is the Company's assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill.  When performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers the impact of factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance of each reporting unit, litigation and new legislation.  If based on the qualitative assessments, the Company believes it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the reporting unit's carrying amount, or periodically as deemed appropriate by management, the Company will prepare an estimation of the respective reporting unit's fair value utilizing a quantitative approach.  If a quantitative fair value estimation is required, the Company estimates the fair value of the applicable reportable units, using a combination of discounted projected cash flows and market valuations for comparable companies as of the valuation date.  The Company's inputs into the fair value estimates for goodwill are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( the FASB Codification ). If this estimation of fair value indicates that impairment potentially exists, the Company will then measure the amount of the impairment, if any.  Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.  Changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these fair value estimates and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. 
    
  Our 2016 assessments and calculations for LTL, Intermodal and Pool Distribution indicated that, as of June 30, 2016, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value.  However, due to the financial performance of the Total Quality, Inc. ("TQI") reporting unit falling notably short of previous projections, declining revenue from significant customers and strategic initiatives not having the required impact on financial results, the Company reduced TQI's projected cash flows and as a result the estimate of TQI's fair value no longer exceeded the respective carrying value.  As a result of these assessments, the Company concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated for the TQI reporting unit, which is included in the TLX reportable segment.  Consequently, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of   $25,686   for the TQI reporting unit during the three months ended June 30, 2016.   
    
  The following is a summary of the changes in goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Approximately   $100,156   of goodwill, not including the goodwill acquired with the Towne acquisition, is deductible for tax purposes.

Additionally, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized on assets classified as held and used when the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value. If such measurement indicates a possible impairment, the estimated fair value of the asset is compared to its net book value to measure the impairment charge, if any.  In conjunction with the TQI goodwill impairment assessment the Company determined there were indicators that TQI's customer relationship and non-compete intangible assets  were impaired as the undiscounted cash flows associated with the applicable assets no longer exceeded the related assets' net book values.  The Company then estimated the current market values of the customer relationship and non-compete assets using an income approach (level 3).  Under this method, an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To estimate fair value, the Company used cash flows discounted at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each type of asset. The Company believes that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions.  As a result of these estimates the Company recorded an impairment charge of   $16,501   related to TQI customer relationships.   
    
  The Company is still in the process of finalizing certain valuations related to the goodwill and customer relationship impairment analyses.  Adjustments, if any, to its estimates as a result of completing its valuation analysis will be recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2016. 
         
  In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company also discontinued use of an owned maintenance facility and began efforts to sell the property.  In conjunction with these actions, the Company incurred a   $255   impairment charge that was estimated using current offers received to sell the property less estimated cost to sell the facility. 

4.    Share-Based Payments 
    
  The Company s general practice has been to make a single annual grant of share-based compensation to key employees and to make other employee grants only in connection with new employment or promotions.  Forms of share-based compensation granted to employees by the Company include stock options, non-vested shares of common stock ( non-vested share ), and performance shares.  The Company also typically makes a single annual grant of non-vested shares to non-employee directors in conjunction with the annual election of non-employee directors to the Board of Directors.  Share-based compensation is based on the grant date fair value of the instrument and is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period, or vesting period.  The Company estimates forfeitures based upon historical experience.  All share-based compensation expense is recognized in salaries, wages and employee benefits. 
    
  Employee Activity - Stock Options 
    
  Stock option grants to employees generally expire   seven   years from the grant date and typically vest ratably over a   three  -year period.  The Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of options granted.  The weighted-average fair value of options granted and assumptions used to estimate their fair value during the three and    nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:

Employee Activity - Performance Shares 
    
  The Company annually grants performance shares to key employees.  Under the terms of the performance share agreements, on the third anniversary of the grant date, the Company will issue to the employees a calculated number of common stock shares based on the   three   year performance of the Company s total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of a selected peer group.  No shares may be issued if the Company's total shareholder return outperforms   30%   or less of the peer group, but the number of shares issued may be doubled if the Company's total shareholder return performs better than   90%   of the peer group.  The fair value of the performance shares was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation.  The weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo estimate were as follows:

Employee Activity - Employee Stock Purchase Plan  
  Under the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ), which has been approved by shareholders, the Company is authorized to issue up to a remaining   387,395   shares of common stock to employees of the Company. These shares may be issued at a price equal to   90%   of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six-month purchase period. Common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and/or up to   two   large lump sum contributions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, participants under the plan purchased   5,592   shares at an average price of   $38.50   per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, participants under the plan purchased   5,087   shares at an average price of   $44.74   per share. The weighted-average fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP granted for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is equal to the discount from the market value of the common stock at the end of each six month purchase period, was   $6.03   per share. The weighted-average fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP granted for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is equal to the discount from the market value of the common stock at the end of each six month purchase period, was   $7.52   per share. Share-based compensation expense of   $34   and   $37   was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Non-employee Director Activity - Non-vested Shares 
    
  Grants of non-vested shares to non-employee directors vest ratably over the elected term to the Board of Directors, or approximately   one   year.  The following tables summarize the Company s non-employee non-vested share activity and related information:

5.    Senior Credit Facility 
    
  On February 4, 2015, the Company entered into a   five  -year senior, unsecured credit facility (the  Facility ) with a maximum aggregate principal amount of   $275,000  , including a revolving credit facility of   $150,000   and a term loan facility of   $125,000  .  The revolving credit facility has a sublimit of   $25,000   for letters of credit and a sublimit of   $15,000   for swing line loans.  The revolving credit facility is scheduled to expire in February 2020 and may be used to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Unless the Company elects otherwise under the credit agreement, interest on borrowings under the Facility are based on the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus   0.5%  , (b)

the administrative agent's prime rate and (c) the   LIBOR   Rate plus   1.0%  , in each case plus a margin that can range from   0.1%   to   0.6%   with respect to the term loan facility and from   0.3%   to   0.8%   with respect to the revolving credit facility depending on the Company s ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to earnings as set forth in the credit agreement. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales, investments, transactions or to incur liens or indebtedness, as set forth in the credit agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had utilized   $9,414   of availability for outstanding letters of credit and had   $140,586   of available borrowing capacity outstanding under the revolving credit facility.   
    
  In conjunction with the acquisition of Towne (see note 3), the Company borrowed   $125,000   on the available term loan.  The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of   11.1%   of the original principal amount of the term loan plus accrued and unpaid interest, and matures in March 2017.  The interest rate on the term loan was   1.8%   at September 30, 2016. The remaining balance on the term loan was   $41,675   as of September 30, 2016 and is a current liability. The balance on the term loan was $83,338 and the interest rate was 1.5% as of December 31, 2015. 

6.    Net Income Per Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share: 

The number of instruments that could potentially dilute net income per basic share in the future, but that were not included in the computation of net income per diluted share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented, are as follows: 

7.    Income Taxes 
    
  The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and Canada. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or Canadian examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.

  September 30, 2016 

For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the effective income tax rates varied from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35.0%, primarily as a result of the effect of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, and permanent differences between book and tax net income.  The combined federal and state effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   50.7%   compared to a rate of   36.8%     for the same period in 2015.  The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate was attributable to the TQI goodwill write off (Note 3) that is not deductible for tax purposes.  

8.    Financial Instruments 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments: 
    
  Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value based on their short-term nature. 
    
  The Company s revolving credit facility and term loan bear variable interest rates plus additional basis points based upon covenants related to total indebtedness to earnings.  As the term loan bears a variable interest rate, the carrying value approximates fair value. Using interest rate quotes and discounted cash flows, the Company estimated the fair value of its outstanding capital lease obligations as follows: 

The Company's fair value estimates for the above financial instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

9.    Shareholders' Equity 
    
  During each quarter of 2015 and the first, second and third quarters of 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of   $0.12   per share of common stock.  The Company expects to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors. 
    
  On February 7, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase authorization for up to   two million   shares of our common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased   222,388   shares for $9,996, or an average of $44.95 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 676,773 shares for $29,986, or an average of $44.31 per share.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 204,590 for $9,996, or $48.86 per share.  
    
  On July 21, 2016, our Board of Directors canceled the Company s remaining 2014 share repurchase authorization and approved a stock repurchase authorization for up to   three million   shares of the Company s common stock. All shares remain for repurchase, as shares repurchased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were made under the 2014 plan. 

10.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  From time to time, the Company is party to ordinary, routine litigation incidental to and arising in the normal course of business.  The Company does not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  The primary claims in the Company s business relate to workers  compensation, property damage, vehicle liability and medical benefits. Most of the Company s insurance coverage provides for self-insurance levels with primary and excess coverage which management believes is sufficient to adequately protect the Company from catastrophic claims. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for all incurred claims up to the self-insured limits, including provision for estimated claims incurred but not reported.

  September 30, 2016 

The Company estimates its self-insurance loss exposure by evaluating the merits and circumstances surrounding individual known claims and by performing hindsight and actuarial analysis to determine an estimate of probable losses on claims incurred but not reported.  Such losses should be realized immediately as the events underlying the claims have already occurred as of the balance sheet dates.  
    
  Because of the uncertainty of the ultimate resolution of outstanding claims, as well as uncertainty regarding claims incurred but not reported, it is possible that management s provision for these losses could change materially in the near term. However, no estimate can currently be made of the range of additional loss that is at least reasonably possible. 

11.    Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company operates in   four   reportable segments based on information available to and used by the chief operating decision maker.  Expedited LTL provides time-definite transportation and logistics services to the deferred air freight market.  The TLX segment provides expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services and maximum security and temperature-controlled logistics services.  Our Intermodal segment provides container and intermodal drayage services.   Pool Distribution provides pool distribution services primarily to regional and national distributors and retailers.   
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed its reportable segments to separate its truckload and intermodal businesses from our Expedited LTL service and to aggregate reporting for truckload services into a single segment.  The Company previously reported   three   segments: Forward Air, Forward Air Solutions and Total Quality, Inc. Consequently, the Company now reports   four   segments: Expedited LTL, Expedited Truckload Services ( TLX ), Intermodal and Pool Distribution.  All prior year segment amounts have been restated to reflect this new reporting structure. 
  Except for certain insurance activity, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For workers compensation and vehicle claims each segment is charged an insurance premium and is also charged a deductible that corresponds with the our corporate deductibles disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  However, any losses beyond our deductibles and any loss development factors applied to our outstanding claims as a result of actuary analysis are not passed to the segments, but kept at the corporate level.   
    
  Segment data includes intersegment revenues.  Assets and costs of the corporate headquarters are allocated to the segments based on usage.  The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on income from operations.  The Company s business is conducted in the U.S. and Canada. 
    
  The following tables summarize segment information about results from operations and assets used by the chief operating decision maker of the Company in making decisions regarding allocation of assets and resources as of and for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.

Item 2. 
    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview and Executive Summary 
    
  Our services are classified into   four   principal reportable segments: Expedited LTL, Expedited Truckload Services ( TLX ), Intermodal and Pool Distribution. 
    
  Through the Expedited LTL segment, we provide time-definite transportation services to the North American deferred air freight market. Our Expedited LTL service operates a comprehensive national network for the time-definite surface transportation of expedited ground freight. The Expedited LTL service offers customers local pick-up and delivery and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective, reliable alternative to air transportation. Expedited LTL s other services include shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage, and other handling. The Expedited LTL segment primarily provides its transportation services through a network of terminals located at or near airports in the United States and Canada. 
    
  Through our TLX segment we provide expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services and maximum security and temperature-controlled logistics services. We are able to expedite this service by utilizing a dedicated fleet of team owner operators, some team company drivers as well as third party transportation providers. The TLX segment provides full truckload service in the United States and Canada.   
    
  Our Intermodal segment provides container and intermodal drayage services primarily within the Midwest region of the United States. Drayage is essentially the first and last mile of the movement of an intermodal container. We are providing this service both to and from ports and rail heads. Our Intermodal segment also provides dedicated contract and Container Freight Station ( CFS ) warehouse and handling services. Today Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest but through acquisition as well as green-field start-ups we anticipate moving into other geographies within the United States. 
    
  We provide pool distribution services throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest continental United States. Pool distribution involves managing high-frequency handling and distribution of time-sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions. Our primary customers for this service are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers, such as mall, strip mall and outlet based retail chains.  
    
  Our operations, particularly our network of hubs and terminals, represent substantial fixed costs. Consequently, our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other lines of businesses, such as Truckload, Intermodal and Pool Distribution, which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments. 
    
  Trends and Developments 
    
  Acquisition of Towne 
    
  On March 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of CLP Towne Inc. ( Towne ). Towne is a full-service trucking provider offering time-sensitive less-than-truckload shipping, full truckload service, an extensive cartage network, container freight stations and dedicated trucking. For the acquisition of Towne, we paid $61.9 million in net cash and assumed $59.5 million in debt and capital leases. The transaction was funded with proceeds from a $125 million two year term loan. The assets, liabilities, and operating results of Towne have been included in the Expedited LTL reportable segment. 
  Acquisition of Triumph and Ace 
    
  As part of the Company's strategy to expand its Intermodal operations, in August , we acquired certain assets of Triumph Transport, Inc. and Triumph Repair Service, Inc. (together referred to as  Triumph ) for $10.1 million and a potential earnout of $1.3 million.  The assets, liabilities, and operating results of Triumph have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Intermodal reportable segment.  
  In January 2016, we acquired certain assets of Ace Cargo, LLC ("Ace") for   $1.7   million.  The assets, liabilities, and operating results of Ace have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Intermodal reportable segment.

Change in Reportable Segments 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we changed our reportable segments to separate our truckload and intermodal businesses from our Expedited LTL service and to aggregate our reporting for truckload services into a single segment.  We previously reported three segments: Forward Air, Forward Air Solutions and Total Quality, Inc. Consequently, we now report   four   segments: Expedited LTL, Expedited Truckload Services ( TLX ), Intermodal and Pool Distribution.  All prior year segment amounts have been restated to reflect this new reporting structure. 
  Goodwill 
            In conjunction with our policy to annually test goodwill for impairment as of June 30 we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill and other long lived assets assigned to the TQI acquisition. This determination was based on TQI's financial performance falling notably short of previous projections, declining revenue from significant customers and strategic initiatives not having the required impact on financial results.   As a result of these factors we reduced TQI's projected cash flows and consequently the estimate of TQI's fair value no longer exceeded the respective carrying value.  Based on the results of the impairment test, we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated.  Therefore, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded impairment charges for goodwill, intangibles and other assets of $42.4 million related to the TQI reporting unit.

Results from Operations 
  The following table sets forth our consolidated historical financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we experienced a 1.0% increase in our consolidated revenues compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating income increased $0.1 million, or 0.4%, from 2015 to $24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Segment Operations 
    
  Expedited LTL's revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 3.3%, while operating income decreased $0.6 million, or 2.8% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease of Expedited LTL's revenue was the result of lower airport-to-airport volumes due to a sluggish economic environment and reduced net fuel surcharge revenue as a result of the decline in fuel prices since the third quarter of 2015. The revenue decrease was partially offset by improved pricing, the implementation of the February 2016 change to our dim-factor standard and further operating efficiencies leading to a slight increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue. 
    
  TLX's revenue increased $3.7 million, or 9.6%, but operating income decreased $1.2 million, or 37.5%, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in revenue was due to an increase in overall miles and  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

new business wins. The decrease of TLX's operating income was the result of the decline of higher-margin pharmaceutical business and TLX revenue per mile declining at a faster pace than cost per mile.  
    
  Pool Distribution revenue increased $4.3 million, or 13.4%, while operating results decreased $0.4 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  The revenue increase was due to new business, rate increases and increased volumes. The decline in Pool Distribution operating income was primarily the result of higher lease costs as Pool Distribution opened new facilities and relocated others to support business wins since the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Intermodal revenue decreased $1.3 million, or 4.5%, and operating income decreased $0.5 million, or 14.3%, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015.  The decreases in operating revenue and income were primarily attributable to suppressed market conditions, the negative impact of decreased fuel surcharges and decreased chassis rental and rail storage revenues, partially offset by the Ace and Triumph acquisitions. 
    
  Fuel Surcharge  
    
  Our net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates, which are set weekly using the national average for diesel price per gallon, and volume transiting our network.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , total net fuel surcharge revenue decreased 19.9% as compared to the same period in 2015, mostly due to decreased fuel prices and decreased volumes in the Expedited LTL and Intermodal segments. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was $  0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.5 million   for the same period of   2015  .  The decrease in interest expense was attributable to principal payments made on the term loan used to finance the Towne acquisition in March 2015. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The combined federal and state effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of 2016 was   51.3  % compared to a rate of   34.8  % for the same period in   2015  . The higher effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 is the result of the impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of 2016 that is non-deductible for tax purposes. Also, 2015 benefited from the amending of prior year federal and state income tax returns to take advantage of qualified production property deductions. 
    
  Net Income 
    
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net income decreased by   $3.8 million  , or 24.2%, to   $11.9 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   $15.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .

Expedited LTL - Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Expedited LTL segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

27 

     Table of Contents  

Revenues 
  Expedited LTL (LTL), which is our legacy airport-to-airport service, had operating revenue decrease $  4.9 million  , or   3.3%  , to $  144.3 million   from $  149.2 million  , accounting for   57.8%   of consolidated operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   60.4%   for the same period in 2015.  The decrease is partly the result of a $1.2 million, or 1.1%, decrease in linehaul revenue.  The decrease in linehaul revenue is attributable to the decrease in tonnage, partially offset by the linehaul yield changes noted in the preceding table.  The increase in average base revenue per pound was attributable to targeted rate increases implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in tonnage is primarily due to the attrition of acquired, poorly-priced Towne revenue since the third quarter of 2015 and a sluggish economic environment slightly offset by the tonnage increases attributable to a February 2016 change to our dim-factor standard. This change in dim-factor standard allows us to capture more billable tonnage on certain shipments.  
  The remaining $3.7 million decrease in LTL revenue is the result of a decrease in Forward Air Complete ("Complete") pick-up and delivery revenue, net fuel surcharge revenue and other terminal based revenues. Complete revenue decreased $0.7 million, or 3.1%, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in Complete revenue was attributable to a decrease in shipping volumes in our LTL network and an 8.1% decrease in the attachment rate of Complete activity to linehaul shipments. Other terminal based revenues, which includes warehousing services and terminal handling, decreased $2.1 million, or 13.9%, to $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $15.3 million in the same period of 2015. The decrease in other terminal revenue was mainly attributable to attrition of acquired Towne activity. Compared to the same period in 2015, net fuel surcharge revenue decreased $0.9 million largely due to the decline in fuel prices and volume decreases discussed previously.   
  Purchased Transportation 
  LTL s purchased transportation decreased by   $5.4 million  , or   8.8%  , to   $56.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $61.7 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  As a percentage of segment operating revenue, LTL purchased transportation was   39.0%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   41.4%   for the same period in 2015. The decrease in percentage of revenue is due to a 3.9% decrease in LTL cost per mile, improved revenue per mile due to yield and dim-factor changes discussed previously and improved network efficiency.   The LTL cost per mile decrease and improvement in network efficiencies were largely the result of higher utilization of owner operators instead of more costly third party transportation providers.  
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
  Salaries, wages and employee benefits of LTL decreased by   $1.9 million  , or   5.3%  , to   $33.8 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 from   $35.7 million   in the same period of  2015.  Salaries, wages and employee benefits were   23.4%   of LTL s operating revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   23.9%   for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits in total dollars was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million, or 8.9%, decrease in direct LTL terminal and management salaries, wages and employee benefits offset by a $1.2 million increase in corporate support and administrative salaries, wages and employee benefits. The decrease in direct LTL expense is primarily due to a decrease in employee headcount and employee incentives.  Reduction in head count is a result of operating efficiencies gained since the Towne acquisition. These improvements were partially mitigated by higher workers' compensation and health insurance costs and increased share based compensation primarily at the corporate support level.   
  Operating Leases 
  Operating leases increased   $0.6 million  , or   7.1%  , to   $9.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $8.4 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   6.2%   of LTL operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   5.6%   for the same period in 2015. The increase in cost is due to $0.8 million of additional facility lease expenses partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in truck, trailer and equipment rentals and leases. Facility leases increased due to the expansion of certain facilities to service increased volumes from the acquisition of Towne.  
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization increased   $0.1 million   or   1.9%  , to   $5.5 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 from   $5.4 million   in the same period of 2015.  Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of LTL operating revenue was   3.8%   in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   3.6%   in the same period of 2015.  The increase was due to the purchase of trailers during the third quarter of 2016.

Insurance and Claims 
  LTL insurance and claims expense increased   $1.3 million  , or   50.0%  , to   $3.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $2.6 million   for the same period of 2015.  Insurance and claims was   2.7%   of operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.7%   for the same period of 2015.  The increase was partly attributable to a $0.5 million increase in reserves for prior period vehicle accidents and associated loss development factors. The remaining increase was attributable to higher insurance premiums associated with our current year insurance plan renewals.

  LTL fuel expense decreased $  0.2 million  , or   20.0  %, to $  0.8 million   for the third quarter of 2016 from $  1.0 million   in the same period of 2015.  Fuel expenses were   0.6  % of LTL operating revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   0.7  % in the   third   quarter of 2015.  LTL fuel expenses decreased due to a decline in year-over-year fuel prices. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  Other operating expenses increased $  1.2 million  , or   9.4%  , to   $14.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $12.8 million   in the same period of 2015.  Other operating expenses were   9.7%   of LTL operating revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   8.6%   in the same period of 2015. The increase in total dollars and as percentage of revenue was the result of increases in sales promotions for a customer appreciation event during the third quarter of 2016, vehicle maintenance reserves and higher costs, such as tolls, associated with our increased utilization of owner operators.  
  Income from Operations 
  Income from operations decreased by   $0.6 million  , or   2.8%  , to   $21.0 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with   $21.6 million   for the same period in 2015.  Income from operations as a percentage of LTL operating revenue was   14.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   14.5%   in the same period of 2015. The slight improvement in income from operations as a percentage of revenue was attributable to prior year targeted rate increases, the February 2016 change to our dim-factor standard and further operating efficiencies. The decline in income from operations in total dollars was the result of the decline in revenue and higher other operating expenses partially offset by prior year targeted rate increases, change to our dim-factor standard and other operating efficiencies.

Expedited Truckload Services - Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Expedited Truckload Services segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Revenues 
       
  Expedited Truckload Services (TLX) revenue, which is legacy Forward Air truckload services and our pharmaceutical services, increased   $3.7 million  , or   9.6%  , to   $42.2 million   in the third quarter of 2016 from   $38.5 million   in the third quarter of 2015.  TLX revenue increased due to a 19.9% increase in overall miles and new business wins in our legacy truckload services. TLX had a 7.3% decrease in average revenue per mile on a shift in business mix that moved away from revenue requiring use of more

expensive third party transportation providers. Revenue per mile also declined due to the decrease in pharmaceutical revenue which historically has a higher revenue per mile than traditional truckload business.  
  Purchased Transportation 
    
  Purchased transportation costs for our TLX revenue increased   $4.2 million  , or   16.5%  , to   $29.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  25.5 million   for the same period in 2015. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , TLX purchased transportation costs represented   70.4  % of TLX revenue compared to   66.2  % for the same period in 2015.  The increase in TLX purchased transportation was attributable to a 22.1% increase in non-Company miles driven during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in non-Company miles was slightly offset by a 2.7% decrease in cost per mile during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in TLX non-Company miles driven was attributable to the business wins discussed above. The decrease in cost per mile was due to TLX's ability to utilize owner operators to cover the additional miles instead of more costly third party transportation providers.  The increase in TLX purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to TLX cost per mile not decreasing in proportion with the previously discussed decline in TLX revenue per mile.  
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
    
  Salaries, wages and employee benefits of TLX increased by $  0.2 million  , or   4.3  %, to $  4.9 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 from $  4.7 million   in the same period of 2015.  Salaries, wages and employee benefits were   11.6  % of TLX s operating revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   12.2  % for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue was mostly attributable to a 0.4% decrease in share based compensation as a percent of revenue and a 0.2% decrease in workers' compensation as a percent of revenue.  
  Operating Leases 
  Operating leases decreased $  0.1 million  , or   50.0  %, to $  0.1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 from $  0.2 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   0.2  % of TLX operating revenue for the third quarter of September 30, 2016 compared to   0.5  % for the same period in 2015. The decrease in expense is due to reduced trailer rentals. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization decreased $  0.1 million  , or   6.3  %, to $  1.5 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 from $  1.6 million   in the same period of 2015.  Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of TLX operating revenue was   3.6  % in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   4.2  % in the same period of 2015.  The decrease was due to the impairment of TQI intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 leading to a lower amortization expense of acquired customer relationships and non-compete agreements.  
  Insurance and Claims 
    
  TLX insurance and claims expense increased $  0.3 million  , or   37.5  %, to   $1.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $0.8 million   for the same period of 2015.  Insurance and claims were   2.6%   of operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2.1%   in the same period of 2015.  The increase was due to higher vehicle insurance premiums.  The higher insurance premiums were driven by current year insurance renewals.  
  Fuel Expense 
    
  TLX fuel expense decreased $  0.1 million  , or   12.5%  , to $  0.7 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 from $  0.8 million   for the same period of 2015.  Fuel expense as a percentage of TLX operating revenue was   1.7  % in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   2.1  % in the same period of 2015.  The decrease as a percentage of revenue was mostly attributable to a decline in year-over-year fuel prices and the decrease in Company driver miles. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
    
  Other operating expenses increased $  0.5 million  , or   29.4  %, to $  2.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  1.7 million   in the same period of 2015.  Other operating expenses were   5.2  % of TLX operating revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   4.4  % in the same period of 2015.  The increase as a percentage of revenue was partly due to $0.1 million in legal fees for an ongoing legal issue. The remaining increase was attributable to higher equipment repairs and costs associated with higher owner operator utilization.

Income from Operations 
  Income from operations decreased by $  1.2 million  , or 37.5%, to $  2.0 million   during the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with $  3.2 million   of income from operations for the same period in 2015.  The deterioration in income from operations was primarily due to the revenue decline of the pharmaceutical business and TLX revenue per mile declining at a faster pace than our cost per mile.

Pool Distribution - Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Pool Distribution segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Revenues 
    
  Pool Distribution (Pool) operating revenue increased $  4.3 million  , or   13.4  %, to $  36.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  32.1 million   for the same period in 2015.  The increase was attributable to new customer business wins, current year rate increases and increased volume from previously existing customers.  The increase in revenue was partly offset by the closing of a facility in early second quarter of 2016. 
  Purchased Transportation 
    
  Pool purchased transportation increased $  1.3 million  , or   14.8  %, to $  10.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  8.8 million   for the same period of 2015.  Pool purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was   27.7  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   27.4  % for the same period of 2015.  The slight deterioration in Pool purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to an increased utilization of owner operators and third party carriers over Company drivers. The deterioration was furthered by decreased agent station revenue, which has handling costs that would not contribute to purchased transportation. 
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
    
  Pool salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $  2.2 million  , or   18.0  %, to $  14.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  12.2 million   for the same period of 2015.  As a percentage of Pool operating revenue, salaries, wages and benefits decreased to   39.6  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   38.0  % for the same period in 2015.   The increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue was the result of a 2.5% increase as a percentage of revenue in dock pay. This was partly offset by decreases as a percentage of revenue in administrative salaries, wages and benefits and workers' compensation costs. 
  Operating Leases 
    
  Operating leases increased $  0.7 million  , or   26.9  %, to $  3.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  2.6 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   9.1  % of Pool operating revenue for the three months ended  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016   compared with   8.1  % in the same period of 2015.  Operating leases increased due to an additional $0.6 million in facility rent expense as certain terminals moved to larger facilities to handle additional business wins. The remaining $0.1 million was due to additional truck rentals used to provide capacity for additional business wins throughout the network.  
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Pool depreciation and amortization was $  1.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Pool operating revenue was   3.8  % in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   4.4  % in the same period of 2015. Depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue as Pool utilized more truck rentals and purchased transportation instead of Company-owned equipment to provide the capacity for the increase in revenue.  
  Insurance and Claims 
    
  Pool insurance and claims expense increased $  0.1 million  , or   11.1  %, to $  1.0 million   for the the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  0.9 million   for the same period of 2015.  Insurance and claims were   2.7  % of operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2.8  % in the same period of 2015.  The increase was due to a $0.2 million increase in vehicle accident damage repairs partly offset by a $0.1 million decrease in cargo claims. 
  Fuel Expense 
    
  Pool fuel expense decreased $  0.1 million  , or   7.7  %, to $  1.2 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 from $  1.3 million   in the same period of 2015.  Fuel expenses were   3.3  % of Pool operating revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   4.0  % in the   third   quarter of 2015.  Pool fuel expenses decreased due to a decline in year-over-year fuel prices and increased utilization of owner-operators and purchased transportation.  These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the higher revenue volumes. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
    
  Pool other operating expenses increased $  0.5 million  , or   11.4  %, to $  4.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  4.4 million   for the same period of  2015.  Pool other operating expenses for the   third   quarter of 2016 were   13.5  % compared to   13.7  % for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in percentage of revenue is due to the decrease in agent station handling costs. This decrease was partly offset by increases in equipment maintenance and terminal expenses. 
  Income from Operations 
    
  Income from operations decreased to $  0.1 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with   $0.5 million   for the same period in 2015.  Income from operations as a percentage of Pool operating revenue was   0.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.6%   for the same period of 2015.  The decline in Pool operating results was primarily the result of  increased facility and dock handling costs associated with the on-boarding of new business.  These increases in expenses were partly offset by the increased revenue from new business wins and current year rate increases.

Intermodal - Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Intermodal segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Revenues 
    
  Intermodal operating revenue decreased $  1.3 million  , or   4.5  %, to $  27.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  28.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decreases in operating revenue were primarily attributable to the negative impact of reduced fuel surcharges, decreased rental and storage revenues and suppressed market conditions. These decreases were partly alleviated by volumes associated with the acquisition of Ace and Triumph. 
    
  Purchased Transportation 
    
  Intermodal purchased transportation increased $  0.3 million  , or   3.2  %, to $  9.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  9.4 million   for the same period in 2015.  Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was   35.1  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   32.5  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to higher utilization of owner-operators as opposed to Company-employed drivers in select markets. The increase as a percentage of revenue was also due to a change in business mix as revenues, such as rental and storage revenues, that do not utilize purchased transportation decreased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 
    
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
    
  Intermodal salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $  0.4 million  , or   6.5  %, to $  6.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  6.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  As a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue, salaries, wages and benefits increased to   23.9  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   21.5  % for the same period in   2015  . The deterioration in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increased workers' compensation and health insurance costs.  These increases were partially offset by less reliance on Company-employed drivers.  
    
  Operating Leases 
    
  Operating leases were $  3.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  Operating leases were   12.0  % of  Intermodal operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   11.4  % in the same period of  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

2015  .  Operating leases increased as a percentage of revenue due to the decrease in revenue with no reduction in fixed costs, such as facility rent. The fixed cost impact was partly tempered by reduced usage of truck rentals as Intermodal increased utilization of owner-operators. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization was $  1.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was   3.6  % in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   3.5  % in the same period of   2015  .   Depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue as Intermodal lost leverage on its fixed asset costs due to the decrease in revenue.  
    
  Insurance and Claims 
    
  Intermodal insurance and claims expense increased $  0.1 million  , or   14.3  %, to $  0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  0.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   Intermodal insurance and claims were   2.9  % of operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2.4  % for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in Intermodal insurance and claims was attributable to a $0.1 million increase in insurance premiums. The higher insurance premiums were driven by current year insurance renewals.  
    
  Other Operating Expenses 
    
  Intermodal other operating expenses decreased $  1.6 million  , or   39.0  %, to $  2.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  4.1 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Intermodal other operating expenses for the   third   quarter of 2016 were   9.1  % compared to   14.2  % for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in Intermodal other operating expenses was due mostly to a $1.5 million decline in container related rental and storage charges. The remaining decrease was due to declining terminal expenses and other variable costs corresponding with the decrease in revenue.  
    
  Income from Operations 
    
  Intermodal s income from operations decreased by $  0.5 million  , or   14.3  %, to $  3.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with $  3.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Income from operations as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was   10.9  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   12.1  % in the same period of 2015.  The deterioration in operating income was primarily attributable to the negative impact on revenue of decreased fuel surcharges and suppressed market conditions. The deterioration was partly eased by the operating income contributed by the Ace and Triumph acquisitions.

Other Operations 
    
  Other operating activity improved from a $  4.2 million   loss during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a $  1.4 million   operating loss during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The year-over-year improvement in other operations and corporate activities was largely due to $3.9 million of Towne acquisition and integration costs included in results for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and no similar costs being included in the third quarter of 2016. The prior year acquisition and integration costs included $0.1 million of severance obligations and $2.6 million in reserves for remaining net payments on duplicate facilities vacated during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The expenses associated with the severance obligations and vacated, duplicate facility costs were recognized in the salaries, wages and benefits and operating lease line items, respectively. During the third quarter of 2015, we also incurred expense of $1.2 million for various other integration and transaction related costs which are largely included in other operating expenses.  The $1.4 million in operating loss included in other operations and corporate activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily for a $0.6 million increase to reserves for remaining net payments on duplicate facilities vacated following the Towne acquisition, as several facilities have yet to be sub-leased. The remaining $0.8 million is due to increased claims activity during 2016 resulting in increases to our loss development factors for workers' compensation and vehicle claims. Other operating activity for the three months ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $0.3 million of additional expenses associated with increased loss development factors. These loss development adjustments were kept at the corporate level and not passed through to our segments.

     Table of Contents  

Revenues 
  Expedited LTL (LTL), which is our legacy airport-to-airport service, had operating revenue decrease   $3.9 million  , or   0.9%  , to   $423.4 million   from   $427.3 million  , accounting for   59.0%   of consolidated operating revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   60.8%   for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in revenue is mostly the result of a $8.9 million  decrease in Forward Air Complete ("Complete") pick-up and delivery revenue, net fuel surcharge revenue and other terminal based revenues, partly offset by a $5.0 million increase in linehaul revenue.  The increase in linehaul revenue is attributable to the linehaul yield changes noted in the preceding table.  The increase in average base revenue per pound was attributable to targeted rate increases implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Tonnage was slightly down primarily due to the attrition of acquired, poorly-priced Towne revenue since the third quarter of 2015 and a sluggish economic environment mostly offset by the tonnage increases attributable to a February 2016 change to our dim-factor standard. This change in dim-factor standard allows us to capture more billable tonnage on certain shipments. 
  Complete revenue decreased $2.4 million, or 3.9%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  The decrease in Complete revenue was attributable to declines in Complete shipment counts and a 10.6% decrease in the attachment rate of Complete activity to linehaul shipments. These declines in Complete activity are in conjunction with the attrition of Towne revenue discussed above. Compared to the same period in 2015, net fuel surcharge revenue decreased $5.1 million largely due to the decline in fuel prices. 
  Other terminal based revenues, which includes warehousing services and terminal handling, decreased $1.4 million, or 3.5%, to $37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $38.9 million in the same period of 2015. The decrease in other terminal revenue was mainly attributable to attrition of acquired Towne activity. 
  Purchased Transportation 
  LTL s purchased transportation decreased by   $15.1 million  , or   8.4%  , to   $165.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $180.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  As a percentage of segment operating revenue, LTL purchased transportation was   39.1%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   42.3%   for the same period in 2015. The decrease in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue is due to a 5.8% decrease in LTL cost per mile, improved revenue per mile due to yield and dim-factor changes discussed previously and improved network efficiency.   The LTL cost per mile decrease and improvement in network efficiencies were largely the result of higher utilization of owner operators instead of more costly third party transportation providers.  
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
  Salaries, wages and employee benefits of LTL decreased by   $2.8 million  , or   2.7%  , to   $102.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from   $105.4 million   in the same period of  2015.  Salaries, wages and employee benefits were   24.2%   of LTL s operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   24.7%   for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits in total dollars was primarily attributable to a $5.4 million, or 5.1%, decrease in direct LTL terminal and management salaries, wages and employee benefits. The decrease in terminal expense is primarily due to a decrease in employee headcount and employee incentives, which accounted for a $8.8 million decrease.  This decrease was partly offset by a $3.4 million increase in higher workers' compensation and health insurance costs and increased share based compensation.  
  The decrease was also partly offset by a $2.6 million increase in corporate support and administrative salaries, wages and employee benefits. This increase was attributable to higher workers' compensation and health insurance costs and increased share based compensation.  
  Operating Leases 
  Operating leases increased   $2.8 million  , or   12.3%  , to   $25.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $22.7 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   6.0%   of LTL operating revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   5.3%   for the same period in 2015. The increase in cost is due to a $2.1 million increase in facility lease expenses resulting from a full nine months of Towne activity and $0.7 million of additional truck, trailer and equipment rentals and leases. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization increased   $0.6 million  , or   3.8%  , to   $16.3 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from   $15.7 million   in the same period of 2015.  Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of LTL operating revenue was   3.8%   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   3.7%   in the same period of 2015.  The increase was primarily the result of trailers purchased during 2016, added trailers from the Towne acquisition and information technology upgrades.

Insurance and Claims 
  LTL insurance and claims expense increased   $2.3 million  , or   29.5%  , to   $10.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Insurance and claims was   2.4%   of operating revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.8%   for the same period of 2015.   The increase was due to a $1.6 million increase in insurance premiums, a $0.5 million increase in reserves for specific vehicle claims and a $0.6 million increase in cargo claims. These increases were partly offset by a $0.4 million decrease in claims related legal and professional fees. 
  Fuel Expense 
    
  LTL fuel expense decreased $  0.7 million  , or   22.6  %, to $  2.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  3.1 million   in the same period of 2015.  Fuel expenses were   0.6  % of LTL operating revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.7  % in the same period of 2015.  LTL fuel expenses decreased due to a decline in year-over-year fuel prices. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  Other operating expenses increased $  3.3 million  , or   9.5%  , to   $38.0 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $34.7 million   in the same period of 2015.  Other operating expenses were   9.0%   of LTL operating revenue in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   8.1%   in the same period of 2015. The increase in total dollars and as percentage of revenue was the result of increases in sales promotions for a customer appreciation event during the third quarter of 2016, vehicle maintenance reserves and increased costs, such as tolls, associated with our increased utilization of owner operator. Additional increases were incurred for the redesign of a new logo and brand image during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Income from Operations 
  Income from operations increased by   $5.7 million  , or   9.9%  , to   $63.0 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $57.3 million   for the same period in 2015.  Income from operations as a percentage of LTL operating revenue was   14.9%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   13.4%   in the same period of 2015. The improvement in income from operations was due to dim-factor standard changes implemented in February 2016, rate increases initiated during the fourth quarters of 2015 and improved efficiency in purchased transportation and dock operations.  These improvements were partially offset by increased insurance premiums and facility and other operating expenses.

Expedited Truckload Services - Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Expedited Truckload Services segment for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Revenues 
       
  TLX revenue, which is legacy Forward Air truckload services and our pharmaceutical services, increased $  7.9 million  , or   7.0  %, to $  120.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  112.4 million   in the same period of 2015.  The increase in TLX revenue was attributable to new business wins in our legacy truckload services partially offset by a decline in pharmaceutical revenue. TLX had an   11.4  % decrease in average revenue per mile and a   23.8  % increase in miles driven to support revenue.  TLX's revenue per mile decreased on a shift in business mix that moved away from revenue requiring use of more expensive third party transportation providers. Revenue per mile also declined due to the decrease in pharmaceutical revenue which historically has a higher revenue per mile than traditional truckload business.

Purchased Transportation 
    
  Purchased transportation costs for our TLX revenue increased $  10.2 million  , or   13.9%  , to $  83.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  73.5 million   for the   nine months ended   June 30, 2015. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , TLX purchased transportation costs represented   69.6%   of TLX revenue compared to   65.4  % for the same period in 2015.  The increase in TLX purchased transportation was attributable to a 27.1% increase in non-Company miles driven during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in miles was slightly offset by a 7.4% decrease in non-Company cost per mile during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in TLX miles driven was attributable to new business wins discussed above. The decrease in cost per mile was due to TLX's ability to utilize owner operators to cover the additional miles instead of more costly third party transportation providers.  The increase in TLX purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to TLX cost per mile not decreasing in proportion with the decline in TLX revenue per mile.  
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
    
  Salaries, wages and employee benefits of TLX increased by $  0.6 million  , or   4.3  %, to $  14.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  13.8 million   in the same period of 2015.  Salaries, wages and employee benefits were   12.0  % of TLX s operating revenue in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   12.3  % for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue was mostly attributable to a decrease in share based compensation as a percent of revenue. 
  Operating Leases 
  Operating leases decreased $  0.1 million  , or   25.0  %, to $  0.3 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $  0.4 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   0.2  % of LTL operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   0.3  % for the same period in 2015. The decrease in expense is due to reduced trailer rentals. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization increased $  0.4 million  , or   8.9  %, to $  4.9 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  4.5 million   in the same period of 2015.  Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of TLX operating revenue was   4.1  % in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   4.0  % in the same period of 2015.  The increase was due to trailers purchased during 2016 and tractors purchased after the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partly offset by the impairment of TQI intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 leading to a lower amortization expense of acquired customer relationships and non-compete agreements.  
  Insurance and Claims 
    
  TLX insurance and claims expense increased $  0.7 million  , or   31.8  %, to $  2.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  2.2 million   for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015.  Insurance and claims were   2.4  % of operating revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   2.0  % in the same period of 2015.  The increase was due to higher vehicle insurance premiums and increased vehicle accident damage repairs.  The higher insurance premiums were driven by current year insurance renewals.  
  Fuel Expense 
    
  TLX fuel expense decreased $  0.7 million  , or   26.9  %, to $  1.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  2.6 million   for the same period of 2015.  Fuel expense as a percentage of TLX operating revenue was   1.6  % in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   2.3  % in the same period of 2015.  The decrease as a percentage of revenue was mostly attributable to a decline in year-over-year fuel prices and Company miles. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
    
  Other operating expenses increased $  1.6 million  , or   32.7  %, to $  6.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  4.9 million   in the same period of 2015.  Other operating expenses were   5.4  % of TLX operating revenue in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   4.4  % in the same period of 2015.  Approximately $0.4 million of the increase was attributable to maintenance expenses and $0.2 million of the increase was driven by operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 including a gain on the sale of equipment that did not occur in 2016.  The remaining increase was due to $0.3 in legal expenses and $0.7 in additional costs to handle the expanding TLX business mentioned above.

Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets 
  In conjunction with our policy to annually test goodwill for impairment as of June 30 we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets assigned to the TQI acquisition.  As a result, we performed fair value calculations as of June 30, 2016.  Based on these calculations we recorded $42.4 million in total impairment charges related to TQI s goodwill and other long lived assets.  
  Results from Operations 
  Results from operations decreased by $  47.2 million   to a $  36.7 million   loss from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with $  10.5 million   in income from operations for the same period in 2015.  Excluding the impairment charges, the deterioration in income from operations was due to the revenue decline of the  pharmaceutical business and TLX revenue per mile declining at a faster pace than our cost per mile.

Pool Distribution - Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Pool Distribution segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Revenues 
    
  Pool Distribution (Pool) operating revenue increased $  14.2 million  , or   16.3  %, to $  101.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  87.0 million   for the same period in 2015.  The increase was attributable to new customer business wins, current year rate increases and increased volume from previously existing customers.  
  Purchased Transportation 
    
  Pool purchased transportation increased $  3.8 million  , or   16.0  %, to $  27.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to $  23.8 million   for the same period of 2015.  Pool purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was   27.3  % for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   27.4  % for the same period of 2015.  The slight improvement in Pool purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to rate increases initiated during the first quarter of 2016 which improved our revenue per mile and our purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue. The decrease was partly offset by decreased agent station revenue, which has handling costs that would not contribute to purchased transportation. 
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
    
  Pool salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $  6.2 million  , or   18.9  %, to $  39.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  32.8 million   for the same period of 2015.  As a percentage of Pool operating revenue, salaries, wages and benefits increased to   38.5  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   37.7  % for the same period in 2015.   The increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue was the result of a 1.4% increase as a percentage of revenue in dock pay. This was partly offset by decreases as a percentage of revenue in administrative salaries, wages and benefits and workers' compensation. 
  Operating Leases 
    
  Operating leases increased $  2.5 million  , or   37.3  %, to $  9.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  6.7 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   9.1  % of Pool operating revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   7.7  % in the same period of 2015.  Operating leases increased due to $1.9 million of additional facility rent

expense as certain terminals moved to larger facilities to handle additional business wins. The remaining $0.6 million increase is attributable to additional truck rentals for additional business wins throughout the network. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Pool depreciation and amortization decreased   $0.1 million  , or   2.2  %, to $  4.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.5 million   for the same period in 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Pool operating revenue was   4.3  % for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   5.2  % in the same period of 2015. Depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue as Pool utilized more truck rentals and owner operators and purchased transportation instead of Company-owned equipment to provide the capacity for the increase in revenue. 
  Insurance and Claims 
    
  Pool insurance and claims expense increased $  0.5 million  , or   18.5  %, to $  3.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $  2.7 million   for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015.  Insurance and claims were   3.2  % of operating revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   3.1  % in the same period of 2015.  The increase was due to higher vehicle insurance premiums and increased vehicle accident damage repairs.  These increases were slightly offset by a $0.1 million decrease in cargo claims and claims related fees. The higher insurance premiums were driven by current year insurance renewals.   
  Fuel Expense 
    
  Pool fuel expense decreased $  0.6 million  , or   15.4  %, to $  3.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  3.9 million   in the same period of 2015.  Fuel expenses were   3.3%   of Pool operating revenue in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.5  % in the same period of 2015.  Pool fuel expenses decreased due to a decline in year-over-year fuel prices and increased utilization of purchased transportation.  These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the higher revenue volumes. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
    
  Pool other operating expenses increased $  2.9 million  , or   24.6  %, to $  14.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  11.8 million   for the same period of  2015.  Pool other operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   14.5  % compared to   13.5  % for the same period of 2015.  As a percentage of revenue the increase was attributable to a 0.5% increase in dock related costs and 0.3% in legal fees.  The dock related costs increase was mainly attributable to the start up of new business. The legal fees are primarily related to Pool's Department of Transportation safety audit.  
  Results from Operations 
  Results from operations decreased by $  1.0 million   to a $  0.2 million   loss from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with $  0.8 million   of income from operations for the same period in 2015.  Loss from operations as a percentage of Pool operating revenue was   0.2  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to income from operations as a percentage of revenue of   0.9  % in the same period of 2015.  The decline in Pool operating results was primarily the result of  increased facility and dock handling costs for the on-boarding of new business.  These increases in expenses were partly negated by the increased revenue from new business wins and rate increases.

Intermodal - Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   compared to Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Intermodal segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Revenues 
    
  Intermodal operating revenue decreased $  3.0 million  , or   3.8  %, to $  76.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  79.4 million   for the same period in   2015  .   The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributable to the negative impact of reduced fuel surcharges, decreased rental and storage revenues and suppressed market conditions. The decrease was partially alleviated by volumes associated with the acquisition of Ace and Triumph. 
    
  Purchased Transportation 
    
  Intermodal purchased transportation increased $  1.1 million  , or   4.3  %, to $  26.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  25.4 million   for the same period in 2015.  Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was   34.7  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   32.0  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to higher utilization of owner-operators as opposed to Company-employed drivers in select markets. The increase as a percentage of revenue was also due to a change in business mix as revenues, such as rental and storage revenues, that do not not utilize owner operators decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 
    
  Salaries, Wages, and Benefits 
    
  Intermodal salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $  0.3 million  , or   1.6  %, to $  18.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  18.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  As a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue, salaries, wages and benefits increased to   24.3  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   23.0  % for the same period in   2015  .   The deterioration in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increased administrative staffing due to acquisition, merit increases and increased workers' compensation and health insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by less reliance on Company-employed drivers.

     Table of Contents  

Operating Leases 
    
  Operating leases increased $  0.5 million  , or   5.7  %, to $  9.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  8.7 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating leases were   12.0  % of Intermodal operating revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   11.0  % in the same period of   2015  .  Operating leases increased due to a $0.5 million increase in rent expense for additional facilities assumed with the acquisitions. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization decreased $  0.1 million  , or   3.4  %, to $  2.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  2.9 million   for the same period in 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was   3.7  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   Depreciation and amortization decreased in total dollars as certain intangible assets reached their useful life in the first quarter of 2016.  
    
  Insurance and Claims 
    
  Intermodal insurance and claims expense increased $  0.2 million  , or   10.0  %, to $  2.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  2.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   Intermodal insurance and claims were   2.9  % of operating revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2.5  % for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in Intermodal insurance and claims was attributable to higher insurance premiums. 
    
  Fuel Expense 
    
  Intermodal fuel expense decreased $  0.7 million  , or   28.0  %, to $  1.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $  2.5 million   in the same period of   2015  .  Fuel expenses were   2.4  % of Intermodal operating revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   3.1  % in the same period of   2015  .  Intermodal fuel expenses decreased primarily as a result of the year-over-year decline in fuel prices, declining revenue and increased utilization of owner-operators. 
    
  Other Operating Expenses 
    
  Intermodal other operating expenses decreased $  3.7 million  , or   34.3  %, to $  7.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  10.8 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Intermodal other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   9.3  % compared to   13.6  % for the same period of 2015.  The decrease in Intermodal other operating expenses was due mostly to a $3.3 million decline in container related rental and storage charges. The remaining decrease was due to declining terminal expenses and other variable costs corresponding with the decrease in revenue.  
    
  Income from Operations 
    
  Intermodal s income from operations decreased by $  0.6 million  , or   6.8  %, to $  8.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with $  8.8 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Income from operations as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was   10.7  % for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   11.1  % in the same period of  2015.  The deterioration in operating income was primarily attributable to the negative impact on revenue of decreased fuel surcharges and suppressed market conditions. The deterioration was partially offset by the operating income contributed by Ace and Triumph since acquisition.

Other Operations 
    
  Other operating activity improved from a   $24.7 million   operating loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a   $2.5 million   operating loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The year-over-year improvement in other operations and corporate activities was largely due to $22.9 million of Towne acquisition and integration costs included in results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and no similar costs being included in the same period of 2016. The prior year acquisition and integration costs included $2.6 million of severance obligations and $11.3 million in reserves for remaining net payments, on duplicate facilities vacated during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The expenses associated with the severance obligations and vacated, duplicate facility costs were recognized in the salaries, wages and benefits and operating lease line items, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we also incurred expense of $9.0 million for various other integration and transaction related costs which are largely included in other operating expenses.  The $2.5 million in operating loss included in other operations and corporate activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily for increases to loss development factors resulting from our bi-annual actuary analysis of our vehicle and workers' compensation claims. Other operating activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included a $0.5 million reserve for remaining net payments on duplicate facilities vacated following the Towne acquisition, as several facilities have yet to be sub-leased. Other operating activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $1.8 million of additional expenses associated with our bi-annual actuary analysis. These loss development adjustments were kept at the corporate level and not passed through to our segments. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment.  However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially.  Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments.  A summary of significant accounting policies is disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies are further described under the caption  Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long Term Assets 
    
  We test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Examples of such events or circumstances could include a significant change in business climate or a loss of significant customers. We complete our annual analysis of our reporting units as of the last day of our second quarter, June 30   th   .    We first consider our reporting unit and related components in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combinations generating the goodwill.   We have five reporting units - Expedited LTL, TLX Forward Air, Intermodal, Pool Distribution and Total Quality, Inc. ("TQI"). The TLX Forward Air and the TQI reporting units are assigned to the Expedited Truckload Services reporting segment.  In evaluating reporting units, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.  When performing the qualitative assessment, we consider the impact of factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance of each reporting unit, litigation and new legislation. If based on the qualitative assessments, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit's carrying amount, or periodically as deemed appropriate by management, we will prepare an estimation of the respective reporting unit's fair value utilizing a quantitative approach. If this estimation of fair value indicates that impairment potentially exists, we will then measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the calculated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.  
  We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of a market approach, which considers comparable companies, and the income approach, using a discounted cash flow model. Under the market approach, valuation multiples are derived based on a selection of comparable companies and applied to projected operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of management prepared projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted using a rate which reflects our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant, and is adjusted for appropriate risk factors. We believe the most sensitive estimate used in our income approach is the management prepared projected cash flows.  Consequently, we perform sensitivity tests to ensure reductions of the present value of the projected cash flows by at least 10% would not adversely impact the results of the goodwill

impairment tests.  Historically, we have equally weighted the income and market approaches as we believed the quality and quantity of the collected information were approximately equal.  The inputs used in the fair value calculations for goodwill are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
  In 2016, we performed a fair value estimation for each reporting unit, except Intermodal as we did not believe it was more likely than not that Intermodal's fair value was less than the carrying amount. Currently, there is no goodwill assigned to the TLX Forward Air reporting unit. Our 2016 calculations for LTL and Pool Distribution indicated that, as of June 30, 2016, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value by approximately 122.0% and 76.0%, respectively.  However, due to TQI's financial performance falling notably short of our previous projections, declining revenue from significant customers and strategic initiatives not having the required impact on financial results, we reduced TQI's projected cash flows and as a result our estimate of TQI's fair value no longer exceeded the respective carrying value.  We concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated.  Consequently, we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $25.7 million for the TQI reporting unit.   
  Additionally, the Company reviews its other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  In conjunction with the TQI impairment calculations we obtained fair value information or prepared new fair value calculations for TQI's other long term assets.  Impairment is recognized on assets classified as held and used when the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value. If such measurement indicates a possible impairment, the estimated fair value of the asset is compared to its net book value to measure the impairment charge, if any.  Through our TQI goodwill impairment calculations we determined there were indicators that TQI's customer relationship and non-compete intangible assets were impaired as the undiscounted cash flows associated with the applicable assets no longer exceeded the related assets' net book values.  We then estimated the current market values of the customer relationship and non-compete assets using an income approach (level 3).  Under this method, an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To calculate fair value, we used cash flows discounted at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each type of asset. We believe that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions.  As a result of these calculations, we recorded an impairment charge of $16.5 million.   
    
  In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2016, we also discontinued use of an owned maintenance facility and began efforts to sell the property.  In conjunction with these actions, we incurred a $0.2 million impairment charge that was estimated using current offers we received to sell the property (level 1). 
    
  For our 2016 analysis, the significant assumptions used for the income approach were 10 years of projected net cash flows and the following discount and long-term growth rates:  

As shown with the TQI impairment, these estimates used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the reporting unit's fair value and goodwill impairment for the reporting unit.  
    
  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools (APIC). The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. The guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this guidance in January 2017 and while the elimination of APIC pools will result in increased volatility of our effective tax rate, the overall impact is expected to be minimal. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB, issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  
   50 

     Table of Contents  

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes", an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes ( Update ). Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The FASB also decided to permit earlier application by all entities as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. The FASB further provides that this Update may be applied to all deferred tax liabilities and assets retrospectively to all periods presented. We chose to adopt the Update retrospectively for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We have historically financed our working capital needs, including capital expenditures, with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $  94.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $  57.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $37.3 million increase in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to a $22.0 million increase in net earnings after consideration of non-cash items, a $24.1 million decrease in cash used to fund accounts payable and prepaid assets and a $8.8 million decrease in cash collected from accounts receivable.  The decreases in cash used for accounts payable and prepaid assets is mainly attributable to the prior year having cash paid to settle trade payables assumed with the Towne acquisition and reduced estimated income tax payments. The decrease in cash received from accounts receivables is attributable to collections on acquired accounts receivable in 2015 related to the Towne acquisition.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $  39.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with approximately $  79.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of $  11.8 million   used to acquire Ace and Triumph, which rolled into the Intermodal segment, and net capital expenditures of $26.9 million primarily for new trailers, forklifts, computer hardware and internally developed software.  Investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   consisted primarily of $61.9 million used to acquire Towne and net capital expenditures of $17.3 million primarily for new tractors and trailers to replace aging units. The proceeds from disposal of property and equipment during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were primarily from sales of older trailers and vehicles. 
     
  Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $  77.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $  28.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The $105.7 million change in cash from financing activities was attributable to the prior year including $125.0 million of proceeds from executing a two year term loan in conjunction with the Towne acquisition. This was partly offset by a $45.4 million decrease in payments on debt and capital leases. Additionally, there was a $6.4 million decrease in cash from employee stock transactions and related tax benefits. Payments on debt and capital leases decreased as 2015 included the settlement of debt assumed with the acquisition of Towne. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included $30.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, compared to $10.0 million was used to repurchase shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  On February 4, 2015, we entered into a five-year senior, unsecured credit facility (the  Facility ) with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $275.0 million, including a revolving credit facility of $150.0 million and a term loan facility of $125.0 million.  The revolving credit facility has a sublimit of $25.0 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of $15.0 million for swing line loans.  The revolving credit facility is scheduled to expire in February 2020 and may be used to refinance our existing indebtedness  
  
   51

and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Unless we elect otherwise under the credit agreement, interest on borrowings under the Facility are based on the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate and (c) the LIBOR Rate plus 1.0%, in each case plus a margin that can range from 0.1% to 0.6% with respect to the term loan facility and from 0.3% to 0.8% with respect to the revolving credit facility depending on our ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to earnings as set forth in the credit agreement. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales, investments, transactions or to incur liens or indebtedness, as set forth in the credit agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had utilized   $9.4   of availability for outstanding letters of credit and had   $140.6   of available borrowing capacity outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  In conjunction with the acquisition of Towne, we borrowed $125.0 million on the available term loan.  The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of 11.1% of the original principal amount of the term loan plus accrued and unpaid interest, and matures in March 2017.  The interest rate on the term loan was 1.8% at September 30, 2016. The remaining balance on the term loan was $41.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and is a current liability. 
    
  On  February 7, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase authorization for up to   two million   shares of our common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased, we repurchased   222,388   for $9,996, or $44.95 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 676,773 shares for $29,987, or an average of $44.31 per share.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 204,590 for $9,996, or $48.86 per share.  
    
  On July 21, 2016, our Board of Directors cancelled the Company s remaining 2014 share repurchase authorization and approved a stock repurchase authorization for up to three million shares of the Company s common stock. All shares remain for repurchase, as shares repurchased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were made under the 2014 plan. 
  During each quarter of 2015 and the first, second and third quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of   $0.12   per share of common stock.  We expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors. 
  We believe that our available cash, investments, expected cash generated from future operations and borrowings under the available credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
