Table of Contents    

  1. The Company and Significant Accounting Policies  
	  Organizational Background:   
	 OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. ( OWCP  or the  Company ) is a Delaware
	corporation and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
	March 7, 2008. We are a medical cannabis research and development company
	that applies conventional pharmaceutical research protocols and disciplines
	to the field of medical cannabis with the objective of establishing a
	leadership position in the research and development of medical cannabis
	therapies, products and delivery technologies. We are currently engaged in
	the research and development of cannabis-based medical products (the
	 Product Prospects ) for the treatment of multiple myeloma, psoriasis and
	fibromyalgia as well as development of a cannabis soluble tablet delivery
	system that may have applications for other indications. We also provide
	consulting services to governmental and private entities to assist them with
	developing and implementing tailor-made comprehensive medical cannabis
	programs. 
	 OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. ( OWCP 
	or the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated under the
	laws of the State of Delaware on March 7, 2008. The Company is engaged in
	two distinct business activities: (i) work with GUMI to commercialize and
	market the Company's Electromagnetic Percussion Device (the  Device  and
	(ii) research and development of Cannabis-based medical products for the
	treatment of a variety of medical conditions and/or diseases such as
	multiple myeloma, psoriasis, PTSD, migraines and a unique delivery system. 
	 The accompanying financial statements of OWCP were prepared from the
	accounts of the Company under the accrual basis of accounting. Certain
	amounts in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
	current presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the reported
	net loss. 
	  Basis of Presentation:  
	 The accompanying financial statements
	have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of
	the Company as a going concern. The Company has not established any source
	of revenue to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an
	operating loss since inception. These and other factors raise substantial
	doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
	assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
	the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 
	  Principles of Consolidation:  
	 The financial statements include
	the accounts of OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. and its wholly owned
	subsidiary One World Cannabis, Inc. (OWC). All significant inter-company
	balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
	  Significant Accounting Policies  
	  Use of Estimates:  
	 The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
	of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates. 
	  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  
	 For financial statement presentation
	purposes, the Company considers those short-term, highly liquid investments
	with original maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash
	equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and
	December 31, 2015. 
	  Property and Equipment:  
	 New property and equipment are recorded
	at cost. Property and equipment included in the bankruptcy proceedings and
	transferred to the Trustee had been valued at liquidation value.
	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets, generally 5 years. Expenditures for renewals and
	betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for minor items, repairs and
	maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Gain or loss upon sale or
	retirement due to obsolescence is reflected in the operating results in the
	period the event takes place. 
	  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:  
	 We review the recoverability of
	our long-lived assets including equipment, goodwill and other intangible
	assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the
	carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of
	possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of
	the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and
	without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are
	less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized
	for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Our
	primary measure of fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The
	measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these
	cash flows related to long-lived assets, as well as other fair value
	determinations. 
	  Foreign Currency:  
	 Non-U.S. entity operations are recorded in the
	functional currency of each entity. Results of operations for non-U.S.
	dollar functional currency entities are translated into U.S. dollars using
	average currency rates. Assets and liabilities are translated using currency
	rates at period end. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded
	as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders'
	equity. 
	  Stock Based Compensation:  
	 Stock-based awards are accounted for
	using the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, Share-Based
	Payments. Our primary type of share-based compensation consists of stock
	options. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model in valuing options.
	The inputs for the valuation analysis of the options include the market
	value of the Company's common stock, the estimated volatility of the
	Company's common stock, the exercise price of the warrants and the risk free
	interest rate. 
	  Accounting For Obligations And Instruments Potentially To Be Settled
	In The Company's Own Stock:  
	 We account for obligations and
	instruments potentially to be settled in the Company's stock in accordance
	with FASB ASC 815, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments. This
	issue addresses the initial balance sheet classification and measurement of
	contracts that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the Company's own
	stock. 
	  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  
	 FASB ASC 825,  Financial
	Instruments,  requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial
	instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on
	the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. FASB
	ASC 825 defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which
	the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
	parties. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of
	certain financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable
	and accrued expenses.) approximates fair value due to the short-term nature
	of the instruments or interest rates, which are comparable with current
	rates. 
	  Fair Value Measurements:  
	 The Company measures fair value under
	a framework that utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
	to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
	highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
	assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
	unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs which
	prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value are: 
	  Level 1:  Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted
	prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the
	Company has the ability to access. 
	 L evel 2:  Inputs to the
	valuation methodology include: - Quoted prices for similar assets or
	liabilities in active markets; - Quoted prices for identical or similar
	assets or liabilities in inactive markets; - Inputs other than quoted
	prices that are observable for the asset or liability; - Inputs that are
	derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
	correlation or other means. 
	 If the asset or liability has a specified
	(contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially
	the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3:  Inputs to the
	valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
	measurement. 
	 The assets or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair
	value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is
	significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to
	maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
	inputs. The following table presents assets that were measured and recognize
	at fair value on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the year then
	ended on a recurring basis:

When the Company changes its valuation inputs for measuring financial
	assets and liabilities at fair value, either due to changes in current
	market conditions or other factors, it may need to transfer those assets or
	liabilities to another level in the hierarchy based on the new inputs used.
	The Company recognizes these transfers at the end of the reporting period
	that the transfers occur. For the fiscal periods ended September 30, 2016
	and December 31, 2015, there were no significant transfers of financial
	assets or financial liabilities between the hierarchy levels. 
	  Earnings per Common Share:  
	 We compute net income (loss) per
	share in accordance with ASC 260, Earning per Share. ASC 260 requires
	presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face
	of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss)
	available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number
	of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives
	effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period
	using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the
	if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for
	the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be
	purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
	excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 
	  Income Taxes:  
	 We have adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Income
	Taxes. Pursuant to ASC 740, we are required to compute tax asset benefits
	for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net
	operating losses have not been recognized in these financial statements
	because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will
	utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. 
	 We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax
	expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments
	occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise
	from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax
	and financial statement purposes. 
	 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
	differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and
	liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are
	expected to reverse. ASC 740 provides for the recognition of deferred tax
	assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur.
	Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating
	sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions
	to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net
	operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards. We have determined it more likely
	than not that these timing differences will not materialize and have
	provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred
	tax asset. 
	 Management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred
	tax asset and its related valuation allowance. If our assessment of the
	deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change,
	we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which
	we make the determination. Our tax rate may also vary based on our results
	and the mix of income or loss in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in
	which we operate. 
	 In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
	uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize
	liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
	jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which,
	additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of
	these amounts is unnecessary, we will reverse the liability and recognize a
	tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no
	longer necessary. We will record an additional charge in our provision for
	taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is
	less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 
	 ASC 740 which requires recognition of estimated income taxes payable or
	refundable on income tax returns for the current year and for the estimated
	future tax effect attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards.
	Measurement of deferred income tax is based on enacted tax laws including
	tax rates, with the measurement of deferred income tax assets being reduced
	by available tax benefits not expected to be realized. 
	  Uncertain Tax Positions:  
	 When tax returns are filed, it is
	highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination
	by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the
	merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be
	ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC 740-10,
	Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions, the benefit of a tax position
	is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based
	on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not
	that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the
	resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken
	are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet
	the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest
	amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized
	upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the
	benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount
	measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for
	unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
	along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to
	the taxing authorities upon examination. 
	 Our federal and state income tax returns are open for fiscal years ending
	on or after December 31, 2010. We are not under examination by any
	jurisdiction for any tax year. At September 30, 2016, we had no material
	unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities or operations
	were required under FASB ASC 740-10. 
	  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
	  Share-Based Payments:   
	 In March 2016, amended guidance was issued for employee share-based
	payment awards. The amended guidance makes several modifications related to
	the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based
	compensation and excess tax benefits or deficiencies. The amended guidance
	also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for share-based
	awards. The amended guidance is effective for us prospectively commencing in
	the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted. 
	  Deferred Income Taxes:  
	 In November 2015, amended guidance was issued for the balance sheet
	classification of deferred income taxes. The amended guidance requires the
	classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on
	the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and
	noncurrent amounts. Early adoption is permitted. 
	 In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued
	Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of
	Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
	Costs.  ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a
	recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
	deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with
	debt discounts. Currently, debt issuance costs are recognized as deferred
	charges and recorded as other assets. The guidance is effective for annual
	and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption
	permitted and is to be implemented retrospectively. Adoption of the new
	guidance will only affect the presentation of the Company's consolidated
	balance sheets and will have no impact to our financial statements. 
	 Management does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will
	have a material impact on the financial statements. 
	 The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to
	make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
	liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
	including those related intangible assets, income taxes, insurance
	obligations and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on
	historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
	be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
	for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	that are not readily apparent from other resources. Actual results may
	differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
	 The Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared by us in
	accordance with the accounting policies described in our December 31, 2015
	Annual Report and should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Financial
	Statements which appear in that report. 
	 In the opinion of management, the information furnished in these interim
	financial statements reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair statement
	of the financial position and results of operations and cash flows as of and
	for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All
	such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The Financial Statements
	do not include some information and notes necessary to conform to annual
	reporting requirements. 
	  2. Stockholders' Equity  
	  Common Stock issued in 2016  
	  Shares Issued upon Conversion of Debt:  
	 In September 2016, the Company agreed
	 to the conversion of $116,000 in
	principal and $3,140 in interest due on two convertible notes  of
	which resulted into the issuance of 39,955,710 and 13,888,889 shares which
	are subject to stock payable with a value of $12,500 resulting in a loss of
	$4,521. 
	  Options Issued for Services:  
	 During the three months ended March 31, 2016 we issued 200,000 common
	stock options. The options valued at $8,074 were granted for services
	provided by unrelated parties. The fair value of the options was estimated
	at the date of grant using the Black-Sholes-Merton pricing model. The
	Black-Sholes-Merton pricing model assumptions used are as follows: expected
	dividend yield of 0%; risk-free interest rate of 1.11%; expected volatility
	of 196%, and option term of 2.75 years. 
	  Common Stock issued in 2015  
	  Stock Issued for Cash:  
	 In August of 2015, we also received $24,000 through a placement of
	100,000 common stock units. Those units were sold at $0.24 per unit. Each
	unit consisted of two shares of common stock and two warrants to purchase
	common stock. 100,000 warrants are exercisable at $0.12 and expire on August
	31, 2016 while the other 100,000 warrants are exercisable at $0.25 and
	expire on August 31, 2017.  
	 In February of 2015 we sold 800,000 shares to one investor for the
	offering price of $0.05 per share that resulted in total proceeds of
	$40,000. During 2015, we also received $50,000 through a placement of common
	stock units. Those units were sold at $0.15 per unit. Each unit consisted of
	one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase common stock. The
	related warrants are exercisable at $0.25 and expire on December 31, 2016. 
	  Stock Issued for Services:  
	 During the interim period ended September 30, 2015 we issued 1,614,935
	shares of our common stock to unrelated parties as payment for services. The
	shares were valued at the closing price as of the date of the agreements
	(ranging from $0.19 to $0.25) and resulted in full recognition of $360,369
	in consulting services expense. During the period ended June 30, 2015, the
	Company cancelled 500,000 shares of common stock previously issued for
	services. 
	  Warrants Granted  
	 As part of the 2015 unit offering, the Company issued a total of 333,333
	warrants to purchase up to 333,333 shares of common stock at $0.25 per
	share. 
	 The relative fair value of the warrants attached to the common stock
	issued was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Sholes-Merton
	pricing model. The relative fair value of the attached to the common stock
	component is $26,416 and the relative fair value of the warrants is $23,584
	as of the grant date.  
	 In February, 2015 we issued 64,935 warrants for services. The warrants
	are exercisable at $0.25 and expire February 23, 2016. We used the
	Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model and inputs described below to estimate
	the fair value of $10,839.  
	 The Black-Sholes-Merton pricing model assumptions used are as follows:
	expected dividend yield of 0%; risk-free interest rate of 0.10%-.0.11%;
	expected volatility of 242%, and warrant exercise period based upon the
	stated terms.  
	  3. Related Party Transactions  
	 Due Related Parties: Amounts due related parties totaled $1,820 at
	September 30, 2016 and $1,820 at December 31, 2015, respectively. The
	Company paid $16,163 during the period ended September 30, 2016 and $21,943 in 
	2015 in rent to a related party. 
	  4. Notes Payable  
	  Unsecured Notes Payable Without Conversion Rights  
	 A loan agreement for up to $300,000 was issued September 28, 2016. The
	agreement allows for six incremental draws of $50,000 to be drawn monthly
	beginning September 1, 2016 in order to meet future working capital demands.
	The loan advances are non-interest bearing. The loan is may be repaid at any
	time but matures 36 months from the date of issue. As of September 30th,
	2016 the company has drawn down $50,000 leaving an available balance of
	$250,000.  
	  Unsecured Notes Payable With Conversion Rights  
	 A convertible note for $78,500 issued on February 2, 2016, bears interest
	at 8.0% per annum until paid or converted and matures November 2, 2016. Any
	or all of the outstanding balance of the note may be converted at the option
	of the holder at any time into common stock of the company at a variable
	conversion price of 65% of market price. Upon the issuance of the
	convertible note, the Company bifurcated the embedded conversion feature and
	recorded an initial derivative liability of $41,974 (the estimated fair
	market value at the date of grant based on the Binomial option pricing
	model) all of which was allocated as debt discount.  
	 During 2015 the Company agreed to provide unsecured promissory notes with
	an unrelated party for $37,500. The note is non-interest bearing and is due
	on September 16, 2016. The note has not been paid and is in default at
	September 30, 2016. The note has a future conversion right that allows the
	holder to convert the principal balance into the Company's common stock at
	the lender's sole discretion at 50% of the then market price per share. In
	accordance with ASC 470, the Company has analyzed the beneficial nature of
	the conversion terms and determined that a beneficial conversion feature (BCF)
	exists because the effective conversion price was less than the quoted
	market price at the time of the issuance. The Company calculated the value
	of the BCF using the intrinsic method as stipulated in ASC 470. The BCF of
	$37,500 had been recorded as a discount to the notes payable and to
	Additional Paid-in Capital. 
	 For the nine months September 30, 2016, the Company has amortized $83,650 ($0
	in 2015) of the discount arising from the embedded derivative and beneficial
	conversion feature of the two outstanding notes.  
	 During August and September 2016, in accordance with the original terms
	of the notes, at the option of the note holders, the entire combined balance
	of $116,000 and interest of $3,140 was converted into
	 39,955,710 and 13,888,889 shares which
	are subject to stock payable with a value of $12,500 resulting in a loss of
	$4,521.  At the date of conversions, the entire derivative liability
	associated with the bifurcated conversion feature of was marked-to-market,
	resulting in an increase of $2,426, to a total derivative liability of
	$55,998 which was reclassified to paid in capital on the date of conversion.
	The $2,426 change was recorded as a derivative valuation charge in the
	Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
	  In September, 2016 the Company
	authorized the issuance of 53,844,599 shares of common stock upon the
	conversion of $116,000 in principal and $3,140 in interest due on two
	convertible notes of which 39,955,710 were issued and 13,888,889 shares are
	subject to stock payable with a value of $12,500 resulting in a loss of
	$4,521 .  
	  5. Derivative Liabilities  
	  Embedded Conversion Feature  
	 To properly account for the convertible notes payable discussed in Note
	4, the Company performed a detailed analysis to obtain a thorough
	understanding of the transaction. The Company reviewed FASB ASC 815, to
	identify whether any equity-linked features in the notes are freestanding or
	embedded. The notes were then analyzed in accordance with FASB ASC 815 to
	determine if the anti-dilution feature should be bifurcated and accounted
	for at fair value and remeasured at fair value in income. The Company
	determined that the anti-dilution feature met the requirements for
	bifurcation pursuant to FASB ASC 815 due to the variable conversion price
	and therefore accounted for the anti-dilution features of the notes as a
	derivative liability. Changes in fair value of the derivative financial
	instruments are recognized in the Company's statement of operations as a
	derivative valuation gain or loss. 
	 The conversion of $55,998 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in a
	charge of $14,024
     
    and an adjustment charge to the market of $2,426  for the three months ended
	September 30, 2016. 
	 The Company values its simple conversion option derivatives using the a
	lattice model. Assumptions used include:  
	 - life through the note maturity date - expected volatility-152%, -
	expected dividends-none  - exercise prices as set forth in the
	agreements,  - common stock price of the underlying share on the
	valuation date, and  - number of shares to be issued if the instrument is
	converted 
	 During August and September 2016, in accordance with the original terms
	of the notes, at the option of the note holders, the entire balance of
	$78,500 and interest of $3,140 was converted into 20,142,568 shares of
	common stock. At the date of conversions, the entire derivative liability
	associated with the bifurcated conversion feature of was marked-to-market,
	resulting in an increase of $2,496, to a total derivative liability of
	$55,998 which was reclassified to paid in capital on the date of conversion.
	The $2,426 change was recorded as a derivative valuation charge in the
	Consolidated Statement of Operations 
	  6. Going Concern  
	 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
	The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating
	costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further,
	as of September 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were
	insufficient to meet its current business plan. These and other factors
	raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
	concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
	classification of asset or the amounts and classification of liabilities
	that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a
	going concern. 
	  7. Subsequent Events  
	 There were no subsequent events following the period ended September 30,
	2016 and throughout the date of the filing of Form 10-Q.

 Plan of Operations 

We
are engaged in
research
 and development of cannabis-based medical products for the treatment of
 a variety of medical conditions such as multiple
myeloma, psoriasis, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and migraine, and (ii)
consulting services to companies and governmental agencies with respect to complex international medical cannabis protocols and
regulations.  

We
have not yet commenced any significant activities related to our consulting services.  

Our
goal is to become a leader in the research and development of cannabis-based medical drugs and treatments. To achieve our goal,
we plan to focus our activities on the following areas:  

Research
and Development   

Our
research
 and development is focused primarily on exploring several formulations
containing active compounds from the cannabis
plant, including (but not exclusive to) the cannabinoids CBD and THC,
and identifying potential therapeutic applications of the
synergistic effects of these active compounds. The synergistic
contributions of our formulations have not yet been scientifically
researched and demonstrated. We aim to standardize the formulations
across the extracts as a whole, not simply by reference to
their key active components (CBD and/or THC).  

Although
there are existing reports and studies on CBD and THC, our formulations will contain several active compounds from the cannabis
plant, that must be fully researched and documented in order to verify its effectiveness to indications, at what doses and which
method of administration will be the most appropriate and effective.  

One
World
 Cannabis plans to produce pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid-based
products and treatments, that will be standardized in composition,
formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate and
efficient delivery system, and tested in properly controlled
pre-clinical and clinical studies. OWC plans to conduct its researche,
led by internationally renowned investigators, at the facilities
of leading Israeli hospitals and scientific institutions. The Company
will adhere to legislation, rules and guidelines regarding
the investigations. Dr. Baruch, OWC's Director of Research and
Regulatory Affairs, and Alon Sinai, OWC's Chief Operating
Officer, will monitor the investigations and researches.  

To
date,
 OWC has signed three research collaboration and license agreements with
 Sheba Academic Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel
( Sheba ). Sheba is a university-affiliated hospital that serves as
Israel's national medical center and the
most comprehensive medical center in the Middle East. Within the
framework of the agreements with Sheba, OWC will initiate three
studies at the Sheba facilities to explore the effect of three
formulations, all based on active ingredients in the cannabis extracts,
on multiple myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia (a specific formulation
to each indication).  

In
addition,
 OWC signed an R D service agreement with G.C. Group Ltd., an Israeli
 pharmaceutical R D company, in April 2015,
to provide formulation development services for OWC's new delivery
system in the form of a cannabis soluble tablet. The
cannabis soluble tablet could provide physicians with the ability to
control and administrate optimal dosage, to replace the most
common usage/delivery method of medical cannabis today, which is not
acceptable by scientists and physicians, such as smoking,
edibles and oil extracts with no adequate means of dosage control. The
agreement was terminated on December 31, 2015.  

The
Company
 expects to start developing other delivery systems, designed for
different indications, during 2016.  

The
Company
 has recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Emilia
Cosmetics Ltd., a large Israeli private label manufacturer,
for the development, manufacture and marketing of a cannabinoid-based
topical cream to treat psoriasis. The Company will initiate
the development of the topical cream by the end of the first quarter of
2016, at Emilia Cosmetics labs located in Yerucham, Israel.
After the completion of the formulation development, expected to be
during the second quarter of 2016, the Company will initiate
a phase I study at the Sheba facilities to explore the effect of topical
 cream on psoriasis. However, we do not know if our expectations
will be fulfilled in a timely manner, if at all, or that the costs of
development will exceed our anticipation.  

To
date,
 One World Cannabis has filed eight provisional patents with the United
States Patent and Regulatory Office (USPTO), all
related to its line of activity related to cannabis-based medical
products. Assuming the successful completion of the clinical
trials, of which there can be no assurance, the Company believes that it
 will be able to retain the intellectual rights and secure
patent protections.  

While
we
 retain full ownership on our intellectual property rights that we
conceived prior to the signing of the research collaboration
and license agreements with Sheba Academic Medical Center, the psoriasis
 and fibromyalgia agreements with Sheba provide that all
intellectual property rights that is conceived during the course of the
research is to be jointly owned by Sheba and One World
Cannabis.  

Pursuant
to
 the collaboration agreements, we expect to pay Sheba $330,000 for
conducting the multiple myeloma trial between the 3rd quarter
of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. In addition, we expect to
commence pre-clinical studies on fibromyalgia and psoriasis
during the second quarter of 2016. Pursuant to the collaboration
agreements, we are obliged to pay Sheba $300,000 throughout 2016
for conducting the psoriasis research, and $100,000 for the fibromyalgia
 research during the two years of the study. We currently
have the financial resources to fund our obligations under these
agreements, but anticipate that we will require additional funding
during the next 12 months for our continuing and planned expanded
operations.

OWC's
Investigation on Multiple Myeloma   

Dr.
Merav
 Leiba, Head of Multiple Myeloma Outpatient Clinic and Multiple Myeloma
Research Lab at Sheba's Hematology Institute,
led the in vitro tests on multiple myeloma. Dr. Leiba, a specialist in
Internal Medicine and Hematology, was a postdoctoral fellow
at the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana Farber Cancer
Institute, Boston, Massachusetts (2006-2008). Dr. Leiba has
participated in numerous clinical and investigational studies aimed at
developing novel drugs for multiple myeloma.  

Our
in
 vitro tests results on multiple myeloma cells studied outside their
normal biological context, on which we announced on June
17, 2015, led us to proceed with further pre-clinical study (safety and
toxicity, PK, PD) of our formulation, to find out whether
it has scientific merit for further development as an investigational
new drug. While we are encouraged by the results of the
limited in vitro tests, there can be no assurance that any clinical
trial will result in commercially viable products or treatments.  

Clinical
trials
 are expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement.
We, as well as the regulatory authorities in Israel
and elsewhere, such as an IRB (Helsinki committee), IMCU - Israel
Medical Cannabis Unit, or the FDA, may suspend, delay or terminate
our clinical trials at any time, may require us, for various reasons, to
 conduct additional clinical trials, or may require a
particular clinical trial to continue for a longer duration than
originally planned, including, among others:  

lack
of effectiveness of any formulation or delivery system during clinical trials;  

discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues;  

slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;  

    delays
or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and
manufacturing constraints;  

delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial, including IRB approvals, licenses required for obtaining and
using cannabis for research, either before or after a trial is commenced;  

unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.  

patients or investigators failing to comply with study protocols;  

    patients
failing to return for post-treatment follow-up at the expected rate;  

    sites
participating in an ongoing clinical study withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites;  

    third-party
clinical
 investigators decline to participate in our clinical studies, do not
perform the clinical studies on the anticipated
schedule, or act in ways inconsistent with the established investigator
agreement, clinical study protocol, good clinical practices,
and other Institutional Review Board requirements;  

third-party entities do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or at all;  

    regulatory
inspections of our clinical studies require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical studies;  

Any
of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

Consulting
Services   

OWCP
believes
 that the complexity of the medical cannabis programs has created a
demand for consulting and advisory services in different
aspects of the medical cannabis industry. The Company's services are
designed to help government officials, policy-makers
and regulatory agencies develop and implement tailor-made comprehensive
medical cannabis programs. In addition, One World Cannabis
offers medical cannabis regulatory compliance services and patient-care
consultancy services.  

Our
initial activities to secure consulting contracts will be in member states of the European Union and states of the United States
that allow for public medical cannabis programs.  

OWC
management has the expertise in designing training programs for physicians, caregivers, and researches that are essential to the
establishment of a successful, patient-focused medical cannabis program. By working with policy-makers, government officials,
public agencies, and privately owned businesses, we believe we can also raise the public's awareness of the benefits of
cannabis-based treatments and products.  

In
furtherance
 of our plans, we may, in the future, consider strategic acquisitions
and joint ventures as well as other projects
to grow our business activities including but not limited to: product
licensing and royalty agreements, consulting, and strategic
alliances to support our Product Prospect development. However, there
can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful
in generating any revenues or growing out business.  

  Results
of Operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015  

 We
have not generated any revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. We have operating expenses related to
general and administrative expenses and research and development. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, we
incurred a net loss of $140,794 due to general and administrative expenses of $74,898, research and development expenses of
$30,363, a loss of $4,521 related to a debt settlement, interest expense of $2,055, a valuation
loss on derivatives of $2,426 and expenses due to amortization of debt
discount of $26,531 as compared to a net loss of $408,225 due to general and administrative expenses of
$311,391 and research and development expenses of $96,834. 

 Our
general
 and administrative expenses decreased by $236,493 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in the prior year. This decrease of 76% is primarily the
result of decreased stock-based compensation.
	 The charge relating to stock-based compensation expense was $0
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $119,199 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.

Our research and development expenses decreased to $30,363 during the
	three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $96,834 during the same period in
	the prior year. The decrease by $66,471 or 69% was primarily due to
	decreased payments related to our collaboration agreements. 

Results
of Operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015

incurred a net loss of $628,912 due to general and administrative expenses of $380,920, research and development expenses of
$102,182,  a loss of $4,521 related to a debt settlement,
 interest expense of $43,615, a valuation loss on derivatives of $14,024 and expenses due to amortization of debt
discount of $83,650 as compared to a net loss of $1,422,255 due to general and administrative expenses of
$1,135,481 and research and development expenses of $286,774. 

 Our
general
 and administrative expenses decreased by $754,561 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in the prior year.
	This decrease of 66% is primarily the
result of decreased stock-based compensation. The charge relating to stock-based compensation expense was $0
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $360,369 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.

Our research and development expenses decreased to $102,182 during the
	nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $286,774 during the same period in
	the prior year. The decrease by $184,592 or 64% was primarily due to
	decreased payments related to our collaboration agreements.

We
had negative working capital of $74,246 at September 30, 2016 as compared to
positive working capital of $299,923 on December 31, 2015. Our accumulated deficit as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $8,177,778 and $7,548,866, respectively.  

  We used
 $397,838 in our operating activities during the nine month ended September 30, 2016, which was due to a net loss of $628,912
offset by derivative valuations adjustments of $14,024, a loss of $4,521 related
to debt settlements, amortization of debt discount expense of $83,650, depreciation expense of $7,255,

of $19,258, an increase in customer deposits of $100,000 and an increase in accrued expenses of
$5,595.  

We used $1,043,552 in our operating activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, which was due to a net loss of $1,422,255 offset by depreciation
expenses of $6,960, shares issued for services valued at $360,369, warrants issued
for services valued at $10,839, a decrease in accounts receivable of $13,346, a decrease in accounts payable to a
related party of $138, an increase
in accounts payable of $28,020 and an increase in accrued expenses of $40,693. 

 We used
 $1,860 and $3,179 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, to purchase property
and equipment. 

 Our
financing
 activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 provided us
with $121,250 from debt borrowings of $128,500 offset buy $7,250 in
debt issuance cost. We financed our negative cash flow from
operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 through
proceeds from issuance of common stock of $90,000. 

 Based
upon
 our cash position of $90,327 at September 30, 2016, we believe that we
 need to raise additional capital, either equity
or debt during the remainder of
fiscal year 2016 in order to fund our plan of operations
including our research and development initiatives for the next twelve
months. There can be no assurance, however, that additional
capital will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated expenditure
 requirements for the next twelve-month period nor can
there be any assurance that financing will be available at satisfactory
terms and conditions or at all, for that matter. 

 Our
auditors
 have issued an opinion on our financial statements which includes a
statement describing our going concern status. This
means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an
on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial
obligations. This is because we have not generated any revenues
and no revenues are anticipated until we begin marketing the product.
Accordingly, we must raise capital from sources other than
the actual sale of the product. We must raise capital to implement our
project and stay in business. Even if we raise the maximum
amount of money in this offering, we do not know how long the money will
 last, however, we do believe it will last at least twelve
months. 

  Our
lack
 of operating history may make it difficult to raise capital. Our
inability to borrow funds or raise equity capital to facilitate
our business plan may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and future prospects.
