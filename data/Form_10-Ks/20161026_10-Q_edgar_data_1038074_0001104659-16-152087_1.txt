   1.  Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   
     
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of Silicon Laboratories Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) at October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the condensed consolidated results of its operations for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include certain footnotes and financial presentations normally required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto for the year ended January 2, 2016, included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 5, 2016.  
     
  The Company prepares financial statements on a  52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2016 will have 52 weeks and fiscal 2015 had 52 weeks. In a 52-week year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. 
     
   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Among the significant estimates affecting the financial statements are those related to inventories, stock-based compensation, investments in auction-rate securities, acquired intangible assets, goodwill, long-lived assets and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the financial statements.  
     
   Reclassifications   
     
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to current year presentation.  
     
   Revenue Recognition   
     
  Revenues are generated predominately by sales of the Company s products. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: 1) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, 2) delivery of goods has occurred, 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, revenue from product sales to direct customers and contract manufacturers is recognized upon shipment.  
     
  A portion of the Company s sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection related to the final selling price to the end customers. Accordingly, the Company defers revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customers. The net balance of deferred revenue less deferred cost of revenue associated with inventory shipped to a distributor but not yet sold to an end customer is recorded in the deferred income on shipments to distributors liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such net deferred income balance reflects the Company s estimate of the impact of rights of return and price protection.

  A small portion of the Company s revenues is derived from the sale of patents. The above revenue recognition criteria for patent sales are generally met upon the execution of the patent sale agreement.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . This ASU provides guidance on statement of cash flows presentation for eight specific cash flow issues where diversity in practice exists. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This ASU requires instruments measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. For operating leases, a lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . This ASU requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its financial statements.

  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In 2016, the FASB issued the following amendments to ASC 606: ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which clarifies guidance on identification of performance obligations and licensing implementation; and ASU No. 2016-12,  Compensation Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which provides clarifying guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of these ASUs will have on its financial statements.  
     
   2. Earnings Per Share   
     
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):  

For the three months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 and the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, approximately 0.1 million, 0.1 million, 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, consisting of restricted stock awards (RSUs), market stock awards (MSUs) and stock options, were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation since the shares were anti-dilutive.

   3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  The fair values of the Company s financial instruments are recorded using a hierarchical disclosure framework based upon the level of subjectivity of the inputs used in measuring assets and liabilities. The three levels are described below:  
     
  Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  
     
  Level 2 - Inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  
     
  Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Company s own data.  
     
  The following summarizes the valuation of the Company s financial instruments (in thousands). The tables do not include either cash on hand or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.

    Valuation methodology    
     
  The Company s cash equivalents and short-term investments that are classified as Level 2 are valued using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Investments classified as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates, amount of cash flows, expected holding periods of the securities and a discount to reflect the Company s inability to liquidate the securities. The Company s derivative instruments are valued using discounted cash flow models. The assumptions used in preparing the valuation models include quoted interest swap rates, foreign exchange rates, forward and spot prices for currencies, and market observable data of similar instruments.  
     
  The Company s contingent consideration is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model or a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in preparing the Monte Carlo simulation model include estimates for revenue growth rates, revenue volatility, contractual terms and discount rates. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for outcomes if milestone goals are achieved, the probability of achieving each outcome and discount rates.  
     
    Available-for-sale investments    
     
  The Company s investments typically have original maturities greater than ninety days as of the date of purchase. Investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following summarizes the contractual underlying maturities of the Company s  available-for-sale investments at October 1, 2016 (in thousands): 

The available-for-sale investments that were in a continuous unrealized loss position, aggregated by length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, were as follows (in thousands):

   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
   (Unaudited)   

The gross unrealized losses as of October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 were due primarily to the illiquidity of the Company s auction-rate securities and, to a lesser extent, to changes in market interest rates. The Company s auction-rate securities have been illiquid since 2008 when auctions for the securities failed because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These securities have contractual maturity dates ranging from 2033 to 2046 at October 1, 2016.  The Company is unable to predict if these funds will become available before their maturity dates. 
     
  The Company does not expect to need access to the capital represented by any of its auction-rate securities prior to their maturities. The Company does not intend to sell, and believes it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell, its auction-rate securities before their anticipated recovery in market value or final settlement at the underlying par value. The Company believes that the credit ratings and credit support of the security issuers indicate that they have the ability to settle the securities at par value. As such, the Company has determined that no other-than-temporary impairment losses existed as of October 1, 2016.  
     
  At October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016, there were no material unrealized gains associated with the Company s available-for-sale investments.  
     
    Level 3 fair value measurements    
     
  The following summarizes quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements.  
     
    Auction rate securities    

The Company has followed an established internal control procedure used in valuing auction rate securities. The procedure involves the analysis of valuation techniques and evaluation of unobservable inputs commonly used by market participants to price similar instruments, and which have been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions. Outputs from the valuation process are assessed against various market sources when they are available, including marketplace quotes, recent trades of similar illiquid securities, benchmark indices and independent pricing services. The technique and unobservable input parameters may be recalibrated periodically to achieve an appropriate estimation of the fair value of the securities.

   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
   (Unaudited)   
     
  Significant changes in any of the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of auction rate securities in isolation could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. An increase in expected yield would result in a higher fair value measurement, whereas an increase in expected holding period or estimated discount rate would result in a lower fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumptions used for expected holding period is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumptions used for estimated yield and discount rate.  
     
    Contingent consideration    
     
  The Company has followed an established internal control procedure used in valuing contingent consideration. The valuation of contingent consideration for the Energy Micro acquisition was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of this valuation was estimated on a quarterly basis through a collaborative effort by the Company s sales, marketing and finance departments.  
     
  The following summarizes the activity in Level 3 financial instruments for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 (in thousands):  
     
    Assets    

Liabilities    

(1)            In connection with the acquisition of Energy Micro, the Company recorded contingent consideration based upon the expected achievement of certain milestone goals. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration due to changes in assumptions used in preparing the valuation model were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
     
  (2)            On March 11, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement which settled the total amount of contingent consideration related to the Energy Micro acquisition (including all amounts for fiscal 2015 through 2018). See Note 6,  Acquisitions , for additional information. 
     
  (3)            The gain recognized in earnings was due to the settlement of the Energy Micro contingent consideration. This gain was offset in part by a charge of approximately $2.7 million recorded in the nine months ended October 1, 2016 for a portion of the contingent consideration accounted for as post-combination compensation expense. 
     
    Fair values of other financial instruments    
     
  The Company s debt under the Credit Facilities bears interest at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin. The Credit Facilities are recorded at cost, but are measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. Fair value is estimated based on Level 2 inputs, using a discounted cash flow analysis of future principal payments and projected interest based on current market rates. As of October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the fair value of the Company s debt under the Credit Facilities was approximately $72.2 million and $77.5 million, respectively.

  The Company s other financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, are recorded at amounts that approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.  
     
   4. Derivative Financial Instruments   
     
   The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to the variability of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company s objective is to offset increases and decreases in expenses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts, thereby reducing volatility of earnings.  The Company does not use derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company recognizes derivatives, on a gross basis, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Cash flows from derivatives are classified  according to the nature of the cash receipt or payment in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
     
   Interest Rate Swaps   
     
  The Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in the normal course of its business, including through its Credit Facilities. The interest payments on the facility are calculated using a variable-rate of interest. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an original notional value of $72.5 million (equal to the outstanding balance of the Credit Facilities at July 8, 2016) and, effectively, converted the Eurodollar portion of the variable-rate interest payments to fixed-rate interest payments through July 2020. The Company s previous swap agreement with a remaining notional value of $72.5 million was terminated on July 8, 2016.  
     
   The Company s interest rate swap agreement is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge.  The effective portion of the gain or loss on the interest rate swap is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders  equity and is subsequently recognized as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the hedged exposure affects earnings.  
     
  The Company estimates the fair values of  interest rate swaps based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. If the Credit Facilities or the interest rate swap agreement is terminated prior to maturity, the fair value of the interest rate swap recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income based on an assessment of the agreements at the time of termination. The fair value of the interest rate swap terminated on July 8, 2016 was not material. The Company did not discontinue any other cash flow hedges in any of the periods presented. 
     
  The Company measures the effectiveness of its cash flow hedge by comparing the change in fair value of the hedged variable interest payments with the change in fair value of the interest rate swap. The Company recognizes ineffective portions of the hedge, as well as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of October 1, 2016, no portion of the gains or losses from the Company s hedging instrument was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material for any of the periods presented.  
     
  The Company s derivative financial instrument in cash flow hedging relationships consisted of the following (in thousands):

  The before-tax effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships was as follows (in thousands):  

The Company expects to reclassify $0.1 million of its interest rate swap losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of October 1, 2016 into earnings in the next 12 months, which would be offset by lower interest payments.  
     
   Foreign Currency Forward Contracts   
     
  The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are used to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposures. The Company recognizes gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period as the remeasurement loss and gain of the related foreign currency denominated asset or liability. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to its foreign currency derivative instruments.  
     
  As of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the Company held one foreign currency forward contract denominated in Norwegian Krone with a notional value of $4.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The fair value of the contracts was not material as of October 1, 2016 or October 3, 2015. The contract held as of October 1, 2016 has  a maturity date of December 28, 2016 and it was not designated as a hedging instrument. 
     
  The before-tax effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments was as follows (in thousands):

   5. Balance Sheet Details   
     
  The following shows the details of selected Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet items (in thousands):  
     
   Inventories   

Notes Receivable   
     
  The Company holds a note receivable from a privately held company in which the Company has an equity investment. The note principal is $1.5 million and matures in January 2017. The amount of the equity investment is not material. In May 2016, the Company amended the note receivable, extending the maturity date to the earlier of December 31, 2018 or certain liquidity events. The Company also issued a second note receivable to the privately held company, providing up to $0.7 million in cash advances. The second note receivable has a maturity date of the earlier of December 31, 2018 or certain liquidity events. As of October 1, 2016, there have been no cash advances under the second note receivable.  
     
    6.  Acquisitions   
     
   Energy Micro   
     
  On July 1, 2013, the Company acquired Energy Micro. In the first quarter of 2015, the Company made the following payments in connection with the Energy Micro acquisition: (a) approximately $20.0 million was paid for the release of the holdback; and (b) approximately $6.3 million was paid for the first annual period of the earn-out. Approximately $1.8 million of the earn-out payment was recorded as compensation expense during fiscal 2014. The remaining approximately $4.5 million of the earn-out payment represented additional consideration.  
     
  On March 11, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Energy AS, the former parent of Energy Micro. The agreement settled the amount of the earn-out to be paid for fiscal 2015 through 2018. The total settlement amount was approximately $16.0 million (in lieu of potential payments of up to $26.7 million) and was paid on May 11, 2016. The settlement amount represented approximately $11.4 million of additional consideration and approximately $4.6 million of compensation expense (of which approximately $2.7 million was recorded in the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and approximately $1.9 million was recorded in fiscal 2015). The compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2016 was offset in part by a gain of approximately $2.7 million  to adjust the consideration portion of the earn-out to fair value due to the settlement. 
     
   7.  Debt   
     
  On July 31, 2012, the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ) entered into a $230 million five-year Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), which consisted of a $100 million Term Loan Facility and a $130 million Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the  Credit Facilities ). On July 24, 2015, the Company and the Guarantors amended the Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) in order to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility to $300 million, eliminate the Term Loan Facility and extend the maturity date to five years from the closing date. On July 24, 2015, the Company borrowed $82.5 million under the Amended Credit Agreement and paid off the remaining balance of its Term Loan Facility.

   Silicon Laboratories Inc.   
   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
   (Unaudited)   
     
  The Amended Credit Agreement includes a $25 million letter of credit sublimit and a $10 million swingline loan sublimit. The Company also has an option to increase the size of the borrowing capacity by up to an aggregate of $200 million in additional commitments, subject to certain conditions.  
     
  The Revolving Credit Facility, other than swingline loans, will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or, at the option of the Company, a base rate (defined as the highest of the Wells Fargo prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and the Eurodollar Base Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin. Swingline loans accrue interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans. The applicable margins for the Eurodollar rate loans range from 1.25% to 2.00% and for base rate loans range from 0.25% to 1.00%, depending in each case, on the leverage ratio as defined in the Agreement.  
     
   The Amended Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which the Company must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default, including financial covenants that the Company must maintain a leverage ratio (funded debt/EBITDA) of no more than 3.00 to 1 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest payments, income taxes and capital expenditures) of no less than 1.25 to 1. As of October 1, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the  Amended Credit Agreement . The Company s obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured by a security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and the Guarantors. 
     
   Interest Rate Swap Agreement   
     
  In connection with the outstanding balance of the Credit Facilities at July 8, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as a hedge against the Eurodollar portion of such variable interest payments. Under the terms of the swap agreement, the Company effectively converted the Eurodollar portion of the interest on the Credit Facilities to a fixed interest rate of 0.875% through July 2020. As of October 1, 2016, the combined interest rate of the Credit Facilities (which includes an applicable margin) and the interest rate swap was 2.375%. See Note 4,  Derivative Financial Instruments , for additional information.  
     
   8. Stockholders  Equity   
     
   Common Stock   
     
  The Company issued 0.8 million shares of common stock during the nine months ended October 1, 2016.  
     
   Share Repurchase Programs   
     
  The Board of Directors authorized the following share repurchase programs (in thousands):  

These programs allow for repurchases to be made in the open market or in private transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions, subject to applicable legal requirements and market conditions. The Company repurchased 0.9 million shares of its common stock for $40.5 million during the nine months ended  October 1, 2016.  The Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $71.4 million during the nine months ended October 3, 2015.  These shares were retired upon repurchase.

Reclassifications From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss   
     
  The following table summarizes the effect on net income from reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss (in thousands):  

9. Stock-Based Compensation   
     
  In fiscal 2009, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ) and the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  2009 Purchase Plan ). In fiscal 2014, the stockholders of the Company approved amendments to both the 2009 Plan and the 2009 Purchase Plan. The amendments authorized additional shares of common stock for issuance, to comply with changes in applicable law, improve the Company s corporate governance and to implement other best practices. The amended plans are currently effective.  
     
  Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair values on the date of grant for stock awards and stock options and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plans. The fair values of stock awards (such as restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs)) are estimated based on their intrinsic values. The fair values of market stock units (MSUs) are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair values of stock options and employee stock purchase plans are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

  The following table presents details of stock-based compensation costs recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands):  

The Company had approximately $59.4 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to granted stock options and awards as of October 1, 2016 that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.2 years. There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized into assets in any of the periods presented.  
     
   10.  Commitments and Contingencies   
     
   Patent Litigation   
     
  On January 21, 2014, Cresta Technology Corporation ( Cresta Technology ), a Delaware corporation, filed a lawsuit against the Company, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., LG Electronics Inc. and LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc. in the United States District Court in the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of three United States Patents (the  Cresta Patents ). The Delaware District Court action has been stayed.  
     
  On January 28, 2014, Cresta Technology also filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ( ITC ) alleging infringement of the same patents. On September 29, 2015, the ITC issued its Final Determination, finding that all the patent claims asserted against the Company s products were either invalid or not infringed and that Cresta Technology failed to establish the ITC s domestic industry requirement. The ITC found no violation by the Company and terminated the investigation. On November 30, 2015, Cresta Technology filed an appeal of the ITC decision to the Federal Circuit. On March 8, 2016, pursuant to a stipulated dismissal, the Federal Circuit dismissed Cresta Technology s appeal in its entirety.  
     
  In a parallel process, the Company challenged the validity of the claims of the Cresta Patents asserted in the ITC investigation through a series of  Inter-Partes  Review (IPR) proceedings at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). On October 21, 2015, the USPTO issued final written decisions on a first set of reviewed claims finding all of the reviewed claims invalid. On December 18, 2015, Cresta Technology appealed those adverse decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as to this first USPTO determination. Those appeals are now fully briefed and awaiting oral argument. The USPTO has instituted a second set of IPR proceedings against a second set of the remaining claims. On August 11, 2016, the PTAB issued its final written decisions in these proceedings and found all of these remaining claims unpatentable. The PTAB decision is appealable.  
     
  On March 18, 2016, Cresta Technology filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.

  On May 13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement for DBD Credit Funding LLC ( DBD ) to buy Cresta Technology s entire IP portfolio and certain related litigation.  Following that sale, DBD (through an apparent assignee, CF Crespe LLC) has substituted in the Delaware District Court action, the appeal proceedings at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the first set of IPR proceedings and the USPTO PTAB proceedings for the second set of IPRs replacing Cresta Technology.  
     
  On July 16, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit against Cresta Technology in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California alleging infringement of six United States Patents. The Company is seeking a permanent injunction and an award of damages and attorney fees. As a result of the chapter 7 bankruptcy filing by Cresta Technology, these proceedings were stayed. However, as a result of the May 13, 2016 sale order by the Bankruptcy Court, DBD and CF Crespe LLC were ordered to substitute in as Defendant for Cresta Technology.  DBD and Crespe LLC have appealed the Bankruptcy Court s order in that regard.  
     
  As is customary in the semiconductor industry, the Company provides indemnification protection to its customers for intellectual property claims related to the Company s products. The Company has not accrued any material liability on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to such indemnification obligations in connection with the Cresta Technology litigation.  
     
  The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against Cresta Technology s (now DBD and CF Crespe LLC s) allegations and to continue to pursue its claims against Cresta and their patents. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters or the resulting financial impact to it, if any.  
     
   Other   
     
  The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
   11. Related Party Transactions   
     
  In August 2016, Bill Bock, a member of the Company s board of directors, joined the board of directors of Spredfast. Spredfast has been a tenant in one of the buildings at the Company s headquarters in Austin, Texas since May 2013.  During the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the Company received payments from Spredfast of $2.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in connection with the leased facilities. 
     
  On July 1, 2013, Geir F rre joined the Company as senior vice president. Mr. F rre was chief executive officer of Energy Micro, until it was acquired by the Company. Mr. F rre was the beneficial owner of approximately 30% of the Energy Micro equity and accordingly received approximately $35 million at closing. In the first quarter of 2015, Mr. F rre received approximately $6.1 million of the $20.0 million paid for the holdback related to potential indemnification claims and approximately $1.9 million of the $6.3 million paid for the fiscal 2014 earn-out. On March 11, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement which settled the amount of the earn-out to be paid for fiscal 2015 through 2018. Under this agreement, Mr. F rre received approximately $4.8 million of the $16.0 million that was paid.

  Alf-Egil Bogen served on the Company s board of directors from October 17, 2013 to April 21, 2016. Mr. Bogen was chief marketing officer of Energy Micro, until it was acquired by the Company. Mr. Bogen was the beneficial owner of approximately 2% of the Energy Micro equity and accordingly received approximately $0.9 million at closing. In the first quarter of 2015, Mr. Bogen received approximately $0.4 million of the $20.0 million paid for the holdback related to potential indemnification claims and approximately $0.1 million of the $6.3 million paid for the fiscal 2014 earn-out. Under the settlement agreement, Mr. Bogen received approximately $0.3 million of the $16.0 million that was paid for fiscal 2015 through 2018 earn-out. Mr. Bogen had invested approximately $0.8 million in Energy Micro prior to the acquisition.  
     
   12. Income Taxes   
     
  Provision for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits and other permanent differences.  Income tax expense was $1.3 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, resulting in effective tax rates of 6.3% and 4.5%, respectively. Income tax expense was $3.3 million and $2.1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, resulting in effective tax rates of 7.4% and 8.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2016 increased from the prior period primarily due to a decrease in the foreign tax rate benefit resulting from a net decrease in earnings indefinitely reinvested in lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in the realization of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in the current year. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 decreased from the prior period primarily due to an increase in the realization of the U. S. federal research and development tax credit in the current year. 
     
  On December 1, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued its final decision with respect to Altera Corporation s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). The litigation relates to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In its final decision, the Court accepted Altera s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its cost-sharing arrangement and concluded that the related IRS Regulations were invalid. In February 2016, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although the IRS has appealed the decision, based on the facts and circumstances of the Tax Court Case, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Tax Court decision will be upheld. Therefore, the Company continues to reflect the effects of the decision in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This change to cost-sharing is expected to increase the Company s cumulative foreign earnings at the time of final resolution of the case. As such, the Company continues to accrue a deferred tax liability for the U.S. tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated foreign earnings because at this time, the Company cannot reasonably conclude that it will have the ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings. The overall net impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is not material. The Company will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  At October 1, 2016, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $3.9 million, of which $3.0 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The Company recognized less than $0.1 million of interest, net of tax, in the provision for income taxes for the nine months ended October 1, 2016. The Company also recognized less than $0.1 million of interest, net of tax, in the provision for income taxes for the nine months ended October 3, 2015. As of October 1, 2016, the Company had accrued $0.1 million for the payment of interest related to unrecognized tax positions.  
     
  The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $1.2 million in the next 12 months due to the lapse of the statute of limitations applicable to tax deductions and tax credits claimed on prior year tax returns.  
     
  The tax years 2011 through 2016 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. The Company is not currently under audit in any major taxing jurisdiction.

   13. Subsequent Event   
     
   Acquisition   
     
  On October 3, 2016, the Company acquired Micrium, LLC, a private company. Micrium is a supplier of real-time operating system (RTOS) software for the Internet of Things (IoT). The Company acquired Micrium for approximately $14.2 million, consisting of cash and stock consideration.  
     
  The Company will record the purchase of Micrium using the acquisition method of accounting and will recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The results of Micrium s operations will be included in the Company s consolidated results of operations beginning on the date of the acquisition.  
     
  The Company is currently evaluating the fair values of the consideration transferred, assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company expects to complete its initial purchase price allocation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.  
     
   Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
     
   The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the  Cautionary Statement  above and  Risk Factors  below for discussions of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.  Our fiscal year-end financial reporting periods are a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2016 will have 52 weeks and fiscal 2015 had 52 weeks. Our third quarter of fiscal 2016 ended October 1, 2016. Our third quarter of fiscal 2015 ended October 3, 2015.  
     
   Overview   
     
  We are a provider of silicon, software and solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet infrastructure, industrial control, consumer and automotive markets. We solve some of the electronics industry s toughest problems, providing customers with significant advantages in performance, energy savings, connectivity and design simplicity. Mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) are electronic components that convert real-world analog signals, such as sound and radio waves, into digital signals that electronic products can process. Therefore, mixed-signal ICs are critical components in products addressing a variety of markets, including industrial, communications, consumer and automotive. Our major customers include Chamberlain, Cisco, Fitbit, Harman Becker, Huawei, LG Electronics, Samsung, Technisat, Varian Medical Systems and ZTE.  
     
  As a fabless semiconductor company, we rely on third-party semiconductor fabricators in Asia, and to a lesser extent the United States and Europe, to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our IC designs. Each wafer contains numerous die, which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an IC. We rely on third parties in Asia to assemble, package, and, in most cases, test these devices and ship these units to our customers. Testing performed by such third parties facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers (particularly those located in Asia), shorter production cycle times, lower inventory requirements, lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity.  
     
  Our expertise in analog-intensive, high-performance, mixed-signal ICs enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets. We group our products into the following categories:  
     
                        Internet of Things (IoT) products, which include our microcontroller (MCU), wireless, sensor and analog products; 
     
                        Broadcast products, which include our broadcast consumer and automotive products; 
     
                        Infrastructure products, which include our timing products (clocks and oscillators), and isolation devices; and 
     
                        Access products, which include our Voice over IP (VoIP) products, embedded modems and our Power over Ethernet (PoE) devices.

   Current Period Highlights   
     
   Revenues increased $21.9 million  in the recent quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from our  IoT, Infrastructure and Broadcast products offset by decreases in revenues from our Access products. Gross margin increased $14.8 million during the same period due primarily to increased product sales. Operating expenses increased $4.3 million in the recent quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due primarily to increased personnel-related expenses, new product introduction costs and adjustments to the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, offset by decreased amortization of intangible assets. 
     
  We ended the third quarter with $279.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Net cash provided by operating activities was $106.6 million during the recent nine-month period. Accounts receivable increased to $84.9 million at October 1, 2016 compared to January 2, 2016, representing 43 days sales outstanding (DSO). Inventory increased to $55.1 million at October 1, 2016 compared to January 2, 2016, representing 71 days of inventory (DOI). In the first nine months of 2016, we repurchased 0.9  million shares of our common stock for $40.5 million. 
     
   Through acquisitions and internal development efforts, we have continued to diversify our product portfolio and introduce new products and solutions with added functionality and further integration. In the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we introduced Wireless Gecko modules focused on mesh networking applications; a major update to our Simplicity Studio  software development tools for IoT connected device applications; a CMOS-based family of isolated field effect transistor (FET) drivers; isolated gate drivers designed to protect power inverter and motor drive applications; high-speed, multi-channel programmable logic controller (PLC) isolators; a small, low-power USBXpress  bridge device; multiband Wireless Gecko system-on-chip (SoC) devices enabling both 2.4 GHz and sub-GHz multiprotocol connectivity for the IoT market;  a comprehensive reference design for cables and adapters based on the USB Type-C  specification; jitter-attenuating clocks that simplify 100G/400G coherent optical line card and module design; a fully integrated, pre-certified Bluetooth  module for low-energy applications; a family of isolated gate drivers for high-speed power supply designs; a plug-and-play Wi-Fi  module solution for IoT applications; the scalable Blue Gecko wireless SoC family for the Bluetooth low-energy market; the Wireless Gecko portfolio of multiprotocol SoC devices for IoT applications; next-generation optical sensors that enable enhanced measurement of ultraviolet (UV) radiation  and  gesture recognition; and an optical heart rate sensing solution for wrist-based heart rate monitoring (HRM) applications. We plan to continue to introduce products that increase the content we provide for existing applications, thereby enabling us to serve markets we do not currently address and expand our total available market opportunity. 
     
  During the  nine months ended October 1, 2016, we had no customer that represented more than 10% of our revenues. In addition to direct sales to customers, some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers. An end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer. Although we actually sell the products to, and are paid by, the distributors and contract manufacturers, we refer to such end customer as our customer. Three of our distributors, Edom Technology, Avnet and Arrow Electronics, each represented more than 10% of our revenues during the nine months ended October 1, 2016. There were no other distributors or contract manufacturers that accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during the nine months ended October 1, 2016. 
     
  The percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the United States was 87% during the  nine months ended October 1, 2016.  All of our revenues to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the United States.

  The sales cycle for our ICs can be as long as 12 months or more. An additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ICs. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we typically experience a significant delay between incurring research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, and the corresponding sales. Consequently, if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, and our operating results for that quarter and, potentially, future quarters would be adversely affected. Moreover, the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product, if ever, can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product. Accordingly, if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product, our operating results, as well as our growth prospects, could be adversely affected.  
     
  Because many of our ICs are designed for use in consumer products such as televisions, set-top boxes, radios and wearables, we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand. However, rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business.  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
  The following describes the line items set forth in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income:  
     
   Revenues.    Revenues are generated predominately by sales of our products. We recognize revenue on sales when all of the following criteria are met: 1) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, 2) delivery of goods has occurred, 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, we recognize revenue from product sales to direct customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment. Certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors. Accordingly, we defer the revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer. A small portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of patents. The above revenue recognition criteria for patent sales are generally met upon the execution of the patent sale agreement. Our products typically carry a one-year replacement warranty. Replacements have been insignificant to date. 
     
  Our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period, the mix of products we sell and the prices we charge for our products. The vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products. These discounts are made for a variety of reasons, including: 1) to establish a relationship with a new customer, 2) as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes, 3) to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or 4) in response to competition. In addition, as a product matures, we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products. Our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand, as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products.  
     
   Cost of Revenues.    Cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries; costs associated with assembly, test and shipping of those products; costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance; costs of software royalties, other intellectual property license costs and certain acquired intangible assets; and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs. Our gross margin as a percentage of revenue fluctuates depending on product mix, manufacturing yields, inventory valuation adjustments, average selling prices and other factors. 
     
   Research and Development.    Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as well as new product masks, external consulting and services costs, equipment tooling, equipment depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs. Research and development activities include the design of new products, refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications. 
     
   Selling, General and Administrative.    Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs, sales commissions to independent sales representatives, applications engineering support, professional fees, legal fees and promotional and marketing expenses.

   Interest Income.    Interest income reflects interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment balances. 
     
   Interest Expense.    Interest expense consists of interest on our short and long-term obligations, including our credit facilities. 
     
   Other, Net.    Other, net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement adjustments as well as other non-operating income and expenses. 
     
   Provision for Income Taxes.    Provision for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits and other permanent differences. 
     
  The following table sets forth our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:  

Revenues   

The change in revenues in the recent three month period was due primarily to:  
     
                        Increased revenues of $16.2 million for our Internet of Things products, due primarily to market share gains for our products, increases in the market and the addition of revenues from acquisitions. 
     
                        Increased revenues of $4.2 million for Broadcast products, due primarily to increases in the market for our consumer products. 
     
                        Increased revenues of $7.3 million for our Infrastructure products, due primarily to market share gains. 
     
                        Decreased revenues of $5.8 million for our Access products, due primarily to decreases in our market share and the market for such products.

Table of Contents   
     
  The change in revenues in the recent nine month period was due primarily to:  
     
                        Increased revenues of $33.9 million for our Internet of Things products, due primarily to market share gains for our products, increases in the market and the addition of revenues from acquisitions. 
     
                        Decreased revenues of $4.9 million for Broadcast products, due primarily to decreases in the market for our consumer products. 
     
                        Increased revenues of $19.2 million for our Infrastructure products, due primarily to market share gains and the sale of patents for $5.0 million. 
     
                        Decreased revenues of $18.0 million for our Access products, due primarily to decreases in our market share and the market for such products. 
     
  Unit volumes of our products increased by 24.8% and average selling prices decreased by 8.6% compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015. Unit volumes of our products increased by 12.7% and average selling prices decreased by 6.6% compared to the nine months ended October 3, 2015. The average selling prices of our products may fluctuate significantly from period to period. In general, as our products become more mature, we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices. We anticipate that newly announced, higher priced, next generation products and product derivatives will offset some of these decreases.  
     
   Gross Margin   

The increased dollar amount of gross margin in the recent three month period was due to increases in gross margin of $8.8 million for our  Internet of Things products, $5.7 million for our Infrastructure products and $2.4 million for our Broadcast products offset by a decrease in gross margin of $2.2 million for our Access products. The increased dollar amount of gross margin in the recent nine month period was due to increases in gross margin of $16.5 million for our Infrastructure products and $16.0 million for our Internet of Things products offset by decreases in gross margin of $5.2 million for our Access products and $2.5 million for our Broadcast products. Gross margin in the recent nine month period included $5.0 million from the sale of patents, which had no associated cost of revenues. Gross margin in the prior year nine month period included $2.4 million in acquisition-related charges for the fair value write-up associated with inventory acquired from Bluegiga. 
     
  We may experience declines in the average selling prices of certain of our products. This creates downward pressure on gross margin as a percentage of revenues and may be offset to the extent we are able to: 1) introduce higher margin new products and gain market share with our products; 2) reduce costs of existing products through improved design; 3) achieve lower production costs from our wafer suppliers and third-party assembly and test subcontractors; 4) achieve lower production costs per unit as a result of improved yields throughout the manufacturing process; or 5) reduce logistics costs.  
     
   Research and Development   

27   

Table of Contents   
     
  The increase in research and development expense in the recent three month period was  primarily due to increases of (a) $1.8 million for personnel-related expenses, including costs associated with increased headcount, and (b) $0.8 million for new product introduction costs. The increase in research and development expense was offset in part by a decrease of $1.0 million for the amortization of intangible assets. The decrease in research and development expense as a percent of revenues in the recent three month period was due to our increased revenues. The increase in research and development expense in the recent nine month period was primarily due to increases of (a) $4.6 million for personnel-related expenses, (b) $1.2 million for the amortization of intangible assets and (c) $0.9 million for new product introduction costs. We expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
     
   Selling, General and Administrative   

The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in the recent three month period was primarily due the prior period including an adjustment of $1.4 million to decrease the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. Furthermore, the increase in selling, general and administrative expense in the recent three month period was also due to an increase of $1.0 million for personnel-related expenses, including costs associated with increased headcount. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues in the recent three month period was due to our increased revenues. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in the recent nine month period was primarily due to decreases of (a) $0.9 million for acquisition-related costs, (b) $0.8 million for legal fees and (c) $0.8 million for adjustments to the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. We expect that selling, general and administrative expense will remain relatively stable in absolute dollars in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
     
   Interest Income   
     
  Interest income for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 was $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, compared to $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended October 3, 2015, respectively.  
     
   Interest Expense   
     
  Interest expense for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 was $0.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, compared to $0.7 million and $2.2 million for the three and nine months ended October 3, 2015, respectively.  
     
   Other, Net   
     
  Other, net for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 was $(0.1) million and $(0.4) million, respectively, compared to $(0.3) million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended October 3, 2015, respectively.  
     
   Provision for Income Taxes   

28   

Table of Contents   
     
   The effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2016 increased from the prior period primarily due a decrease in the foreign tax rate benefit resulting from a net decrease in earnings indefinitely reinvested in lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in the realization of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in the current year. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 decreased from the prior period primarily due to an increase in the realization of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in the current year. See Note 12,  Income Taxes ,  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  for additional information. 
     
  The effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate and other permanent items including nondeductible compensation expenses and research and development tax credits.  
     
   Business Outlook   
     
  We expect revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $176 to $181 million. Furthermore, we expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.36.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Our principal sources of liquidity as of October 1, 2016 consisted of $279.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $189.3 million was held by our U.S. entities. The remaining balance was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of municipal bonds, money market funds, corporate bonds, variable-rate demand notes, U.S. government bonds, asset-back securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and international government bonds.  Our long-term investments consisted of auction-rate securities. As of October 1, 2016, we held $8.0 million par value auction-rate securities, all of which have experienced failed auctions because sell orders exceeded buy orders. See Note 3,  Fair Value of Financial Instruments , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
     
   Operating Activities   
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $106.6 million during the nine months ended October 1, 2016, compared to net cash provided of $87.4 million during the nine months ended October 3, 2015. Operating cash flows during the nine months ended October 1, 2016 reflect our net income of $41.4 million, adjustments of $58.3 million for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, and a net cash inflow of $6.9 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  
     
  Accounts receivable increased to $84.9 million at October 1, 2016 from $73.6 million at January 2, 2016. The increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from normal variations in the timing of collections and billings. Our average DSO was 43 days at October 1, 2016 and 41 days at January 2, 2016.  
     
  Inventory increased to $55.1 million at October 1, 2016 from $53.9 million at January 2, 2016. Our inventory level is primarily impacted by our need to make purchase commitments to support forecasted demand and variations between forecasted and actual demand. Our DOI was 71 days at October 1, 2016 and 73 days at January 2, 2016.  
     
   Investing Activities   
     
  Net cash used in investing activities was $15.8 million during the nine months ended October 1, 2016, compared to net cash used of $8.6 million during the nine months ended October 3, 2015. The increase in cash outflows was principally due to an increase of $83.1 million in net purchases of marketable securities, offset by $76.9 million in net payments for the acquisition of businesses during the nine months ended October 3, 2015, including $56.9 million for the purchase of Bluegiga and $20.0 million for consideration previously withheld in connection with our purchase of Energy Micro.  
     
  We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $12 to $14 million for fiscal 2016. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities.

   Financing Activities   
     
   Net cash used in financing activities was $56.7 million during the nine months ended October 1, 2016, compared to net cash used of $84.8 million during the nine months ended October 3, 2015. The decrease in cash outflows was principally due to a decrease of $87.2 million in payments on debt and a decrease of  $30.9 million for repurchases of our common stock,  offset by $81.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during the nine months ended October 3, 2015. In July 2015, we amended our Credit Agreement. In August 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock through December 2016. 
     
   Debt   
     
  On July 31, 2012, we entered into a $230 million five-year Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), which consisted of a $100 million Term Loan Facility and a $130 million Revolving Credit Facility  (collectively, the  Credit Facilities ). On July 24, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) in order to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility to $300 million, eliminate the Term Loan Facility and extend the maturity date to five years from the closing date. On July 24, 2015, we borrowed $82.5 million under the Amended Credit Agreement and paid off the remaining balance of our Term Loan Facility. 
     
  The Amended Credit Agreement includes a $25 million letter of credit sublimit and a $10 million swingline loan sublimit. We also have an option to increase the size of the  borrowing capacity by up to an aggregate of $200 million in additional commitments, subject to certain conditions. See Note 7,  Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
     
  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, the timing and extent of research and development projects, potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit under our Credit Facilities are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next 12 months, although we could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding prior to that time. We may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing.  
     
   Contractual Obligations   
     
  Our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2016 included $10.7 million for other long-term obligations, including $9.3 million for estimated contingent consideration payments due in connection with the acquisition of Energy Micro. In March 2016, we settled the remaining amount of the contingent consideration to be paid. The settlement amount was paid in May 2016. As of October 1, 2016, there were no other material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates. We also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies, such as our policies for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors; however, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

   Inventory valuation     We assess the recoverability of inventories through the application of a set of methods, assumptions and estimates. In determining net realizable value, we write down inventory that may be slow moving or have some form of obsolescence, including inventory that has aged more than 12 months. We also adjust the valuation of inventory when its manufacturing cost exceeds the estimated market value less selling costs. We assess the potential for any unusual customer returns based on known quality or business issues and write-off inventory losses for scrap or non-saleable material. Inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of our 12-month forecasted demand. The result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace to determine the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels. Demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time, and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project. In the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. 
     
   Stock-based compensation     We recognize the fair-value of stock-based compensation transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of our full-value stock awards (with the exception of market-based performance awards) equals the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our market-based performance awards is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The fair value of our stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little stock-based compensation cost. See Note 9,  Stock-Based Compensation , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
     
   Investments in auction-rate securities     We determine the fair value of our investments in auction-rate securities using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates, amount of cash flows, expected holding periods of the securities and a discount to reflect our inability to liquidate the securities. For available-for-sale auction-rate securities, if the calculated value is below the carrying amount of the securities, we then determine if the decline in value is other-than-temporary. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in underlying credit ratings, forecasted recovery, our intent to sell or the likelihood that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made. When we conclude that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, we assess whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of these two conditions is met, we recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value. If we do not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
     
   Acquired intangible assets     When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable intangible assets, such as acquired technology and customer relationships. Fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges, and those charges could be material to our results of operations. 
     
   Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets     We review long-lived assets which are held and used, including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast. If the asset is considered to be impaired, we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.

Table of Contents   
     
  We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value. In determining fair value, the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. If the fair value is less than the net book value, the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount.  
     
   Income taxes     We are required to calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves calculating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income (loss) for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we are required to estimate the amount of expected future taxable income. Judgment is inherent in this process and differences between the estimated and actual taxable income could result in a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     
  We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step requires us to determine whether the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition. Therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This measurement step is inherently complex and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, expirations of statutes of limitation, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.  
     
  Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax. We believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . This ASU provides guidance on statement of cash flows presentation for eight specific cash flow issues where diversity in practice exists. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This ASU requires instruments measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements.

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. For operating leases, a lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . This ASU requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect that the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In 2016, the FASB issued the following amendments to ASC 606: ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which clarifies guidance on identification of performance obligations and licensing implementation; and ASU No. 2016-12,  Compensation Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which provides clarifying guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of these ASUs will have on our financial statements.  
     
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
     
   Interest Income   
     
  Our investment portfolio includes cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. Our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after-tax returns on our investment portfolio. Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Our investment portfolio holdings as of October 1, 2016 yielded less than 100 basis points. A decline in yield to zero basis points on our investment portfolio holdings as of October 1, 2016 would decrease our annual interest income by approximately $1.4 million. We believe that our investment policy, which defines the duration, concentration, and minimum credit quality of the allowable investments, meets our investment objectives.  
     
 33   

Table of Contents   
     
   Interest Expense   
     
   We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, including through our Credit  Facilities . The interest payments on the Credit Facilities consist of a variable-rate of interest and an applicable margin. We have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an original notional value of $72.5 million that, effectively, converted the variable-rate interest payments to fixed-rate interest payments through July 2020. 
     
   Foreign currency exchange rate risk   
     
  We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be extensions of the U.S. parent. The functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from remeasuring transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are recorded in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the same period as the remeasurement loss and gain of the related foreign currency denominated asset or liability.  
     
   Investments in Auction-rate Securities   
     
  As of October 1, 2016, we held $8.0 million par value auction-rate securities, all of which have experienced failed auctions because sell orders exceeded buy orders.  We are unable to predict if these funds will become available before their maturity dates. Additionally, if we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of any of our available-for-sale auction-rate securities has occurred, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investments through an impairment charge.

   Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
     
  Information related to quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk is set forth in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 2 above.  Such information is incorporated by reference herein.  
     
   Item 4.  Controls and Procedures     
     
  We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 1, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Such disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There was no change in our internal controls during the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2016 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

   Part II.  Other Information     
     
   Item 1.  Legal Proceedings     
     
   Patent Litigation   
     
  On January 21, 2014, Cresta Technology Corporation ( Cresta Technology ), a Delaware corporation, filed a lawsuit against us, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., LG Electronics Inc. and LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc. in the United States District Court in the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of three United States Patents (the  Cresta Patents ). The Delaware District Court action has been stayed.  
     
  On January 28, 2014, Cresta Technology also filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ( ITC ) alleging infringement of the same patents. On September 29, 2015, the ITC issued its Final Determination, finding that all the patent claims asserted against our products were either invalid or not infringed and that Cresta Technology failed to establish the ITC s domestic industry requirement. The ITC found no violation by us and terminated the investigation. On November 30, 2015, Cresta Technology filed an appeal of the ITC decision to the Federal Circuit. On March 8, 2016, pursuant to a stipulated dismissal, the Federal Circuit dismissed Cresta Technology s appeal in its entirety.  
     
  In a parallel process, we challenged the validity of the claims of the Cresta Patents asserted in the ITC investigation through a series of   Inter-Partes  Review (IPR) proceedings at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). On October 21, 2015, the USPTO issued final written decisions on a first set of reviewed claims finding all of the reviewed claims invalid. On December 18, 2015, Cresta Technology appealed those adverse decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as to this first USPTO determination. Those appeals are now fully briefed and awaiting oral argument. The USPTO has instituted a second set of IPR proceedings against a second set of the remaining claims. On August 11, 2016, the PTAB issued its final written decisions in these proceedings and found all of these remaining claims unpatentable. The PTAB decision is appealable. 
     
  On March 18, 2016, Cresta Technology filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.  
     
  On May 13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement for DBD Credit Funding LLC ( DBD ) to buy Cresta Technology s entire IP portfolio and certain related litigation.  Following that sale, DBD (through an apparent assignee, CF Crespe LLC) has substituted in the Delaware District Court action, the appeal proceedings at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the first set of IPR proceedings and the USPTO PTAB proceedings for the second set of IPRs replacing Cresta Technology.  
     
  On July 16, 2014, we filed a lawsuit against Cresta Technology in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California alleging infringement of six United States Patents. We are seeking a permanent injunction and an award of damages and attorney fees. As a result of the chapter 7 bankruptcy filing by Cresta Technology, these proceedings were stayed. However, as a result of the May 13, 2016 sale order by the Bankruptcy Court, DBD and CF Crespe LLC were ordered to substitute in as Defendant for Cresta Technology. DBD and Crespe LLC have appealed the Bankruptcy Court s order in that regard.  
     
  As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we provide indemnification protection to our customers for intellectual property claims related to our products. We have not accrued any material liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to such indemnification obligations in connection with the Cresta Technology litigation.

Table of Contents   
     
  We intend to continue to vigorously defend against Cresta Technology s (now DBD and CF Crespe LLC s) allegations and to continue to pursue our claims against Cresta and their patents. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or the resulting financial impact to us, if any.  
     
   Other   
     
  We are involved in various other legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
   Item 1A. Risk Factors     
     
   Risks Related to our Business   
     
   We may not be able to maintain our historical growth and may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, which may result in volatility in our stock price   
     
  Although we have generally experienced revenue growth in our history, we may not be able to sustain this growth. We may also experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results in the future due to a number of factors, and any such variations may cause our stock price to fluctuate. In some future period our revenues or operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If this occurs, our stock price may drop, perhaps significantly.  
     
  A number of factors, in addition to those cited in other risk factors applicable to our business, may contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, including:  
     
                        The timing and volume of orders received from our customers; 
     
                        The timeliness of our new product introductions and the rate at which our new products may cannibalize our older products; 
     
                        The rate of acceptance of our products by our customers, including the acceptance of new products we may develop for integration in the products manufactured by such customers, which we refer to as  design wins  
     
                        The time lag and realization rate between  design wins  and production orders; 
     
                        The demand for, and life cycles of, the products incorporating our mixed-signal solutions; 
     
                        The rate of adoption of mixed-signal products in the markets we target; 
     
                        Deferrals or reductions of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors or other providers of mixed-signal ICs; 
     
                        Changes in product mix; 
     
                        The average selling prices for our products could drop suddenly due to competitive offerings or competitive predatory pricing; 
     
                        The average selling prices for our products generally decline over time; 
     
                        Changes in market standards; 
     
                        Impairment charges related to inventory, equipment or other long-lived assets; 
     
                        The software used in our products, including software provided by third parties, may not meet the needs of our customers; 
     
 36   

Table of Contents   
     
                        Significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights or respond to claims against us; and 
     
                        The rate at which new markets emerge for products we are currently developing or for which our design expertise can be utilized to develop products for these new markets. 
     
  The markets for consumer electronics, for example, are characterized by rapid fluctuations in demand and seasonality that result in corresponding fluctuations in the demand for our products that are incorporated in such devices. Additionally, the rate of technology acceptance by our customers results in fluctuating demand for our products as customers are reluctant to incorporate a new IC into their products until the new IC has achieved market acceptance. Once a new IC achieves market acceptance, demand for the new IC can quickly accelerate to a point and then level off such that rapid historical growth in sales of a product should not be viewed as indicative of continued future growth. In addition, demand can quickly decline for a product when a new IC product is introduced and receives market acceptance. Due to the various factors mentioned above, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.  
     
   If we are unable to develop or acquire new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed   
     
  Our future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. The development of mixed-signal ICs is highly complex, and we have at times experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements. Successful product development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors, including:  
     
                        Requirements of customers; 
     
                        Accurate prediction of market and technical requirements; 
     
                        Timely completion and introduction of new designs; 
     
                        Timely qualification and certification of our products for use in our customers  products; 
     
                        Commercial acceptance and volume production of the products into which our ICs will be incorporated; 
     
                        Availability of foundry, assembly and test capacity; 
     
                        Achievement of high manufacturing yields; 
     
                        Quality, price, performance, power use and size of our products; 
     
                        Availability, quality, price and performance of competing products and technologies; 
     
                        Our customer service, application support capabilities and responsiveness; 
     
                        Successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers; 
     
                        Technology, industry standards or end-user preferences; and 
     
                        Cooperation of third-party software providers and our semiconductor vendors to support our chips within a system.

  We cannot provide any assurance that products which we recently have developed or may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. We have introduced to market or are in development of many products. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to develop new products on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected. The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) market is dependent on the adoption of industry standards to permit devices to connect and communicate with each other. If the industry cannot agree on a common set of standards, then the growth of the IoT market may be slower than expected.  
     
   Our research and development efforts are focused on a limited number of new technologies and products, and any delay in the development, or abandonment, of these technologies or products by industry participants, or their failure to achieve market acceptance, could compromise our competitive position   
     
  Our products serve as components and solutions in electronic devices in various markets. As a result, we have devoted and expect to continue to devote a large amount of resources to develop products based on new and emerging technologies and standards that will be commercially introduced in the future. Research and development expense during the nine months ended October 1, 2016 was $149.1 million, or 29.0% of revenues. A number of companies are actively involved in the development of these new technologies and standards. Should any of these companies delay or abandon their efforts to develop commercially available products based on new technologies and standards, our research and development efforts with respect to these technologies and standards likely would have no appreciable value. In addition, if we do not correctly anticipate new technologies and standards, or if the products that we develop based on these new technologies and standards fail to achieve market acceptance, our competitors may be better able to address market demand than we would. Furthermore, if markets for these new technologies and standards develop later than we anticipate, or do not develop at all, demand for our products that are currently in development would suffer, resulting in lower sales of these products than we currently anticipate.  
     
   We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any key customer could significantly reduce our revenues   
     
  The loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any one of them, would significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business. During the nine months ended October 1, 2016, our ten largest customers accounted for 25% of our revenues. Some of the markets for our products are dominated by a small number of potential customers. Therefore, our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to sell to these dominant customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our IC products. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, particularly because:  
     
                        We do not have material long-term purchase contracts with our customers; 
     
                        Substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty; 
     
                        Some of our customers may have efforts underway to actively diversify their vendor base which could reduce purchases of our products; and 
     
                        Some of our customers have developed or acquired products that compete directly with products these customers purchase from us, which could affect our customers  purchasing decisions in the future. 
     
  Our customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which increases their negotiating leverage with us and protects their ability to secure these components. We believe that any expansion of our customers  supplier bases could have an adverse effect on the prices we are able to charge and volume of product that we are able to sell to our customers, which would negatively affect our revenues and operating results.

   Significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which could seriously harm our business   
     
  In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive letters from various industry participants alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or misappropriation of trade secrets or from customers or suppliers requesting indemnification for claims brought against them by third parties. The exploratory nature of these inquiries has become relatively common in the semiconductor industry. We respond when we deem appropriate and as advised by legal counsel. We have been involved in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights in the past and may become involved in such litigation again in the future. We are currently involved in litigation in which we and certain of our customers have been accused of patent infringement related to our television tuner products. In the future, we may become involved in additional litigation to defend allegations of infringement asserted by others, both directly and indirectly as a result of certain industry-standard indemnities we may offer to our customers or suppliers. Legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights. Legal proceedings initiated by us to protect our intellectual property rights could also result in counterclaims or countersuits against us. Any litigation, regardless of its outcome, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert our management s time and attention. Intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions, including:  
     
                        Cease selling or manufacturing products that use the challenged intellectual property; 
     
                        Obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property a right to a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; 
     
                        Redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property; or 
     
                        Pursue legal remedies with third parties to enforce our indemnification rights, which may not adequately protect our interests. 
     
   Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition   
     
  As part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities. The acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including:  
     
                        Problems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our existing business and products; 
     
                        Diversion of management s time and attention from our core business; 
     
                        Need for financial resources above our planned investment levels; 
     
                        Difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired company; 
     
                        Risks associated with entering markets in which we lack prior experience; 
     
                        Risks associated with the transfer of licenses of intellectual property; 
     
                        Increased operating costs due to acquired overhead; 
     
                        Tax issues associated with acquisitions; 
     
                        Acquisition-related disputes, including disputes over earn-outs and escrows; 
     
                        Potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and 
     
                        Potential impairment of related goodwill and intangible assets.

  In contrast to the ICs that we have historically developed, our acquisition of Bluegiga and Telegesis will entail additional efforts to develop modules, which are products that incorporate ICs as well as additional software. We have limited experience with developing modules. Modules tend to have higher average selling prices but lower overall gross margins than ICs. Bluegiga s modules currently incorporate products from some of our competitors. Any disruption in supply of those products would adversely affect our business.  
     
  Future acquisitions also could cause us to incur debt or contingent liabilities or cause us to issue equity securities that could negatively impact the ownership percentages of existing shareholders.  
     
   We may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete   
     
  Our products rely on our proprietary technology, and we expect that future technological advances made by us will be critical to sustain market acceptance of our products. Therefore, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, intellectual property providers and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications nor can we be certain that any issued patents would protect or benefit us or give us adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid or unenforceable. We also cannot be certain that others will not develop effective competing technologies on their own.  
     
   Failure to manage our distribution channel relationships could impede our future growth   
     
  The future growth of our business will depend in large part on our ability to manage our relationships with current and future distributors and sales representatives, develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products and manage these relationships. During the nine months ended October 1, 2016, 67% of our revenue was derived from distributors. As we execute our indirect sales strategy, we must manage the potential conflicts that may arise with our direct sales efforts. For example, conflicts with a distributor may arise when a customer begins purchasing directly from us rather than through the distributor. The inability to successfully execute or manage a multi-channel sales strategy could impede our future growth. In addition, relationships with our distributors often involve the use of price protection and inventory return rights. This often requires a significant amount of sales management s time and system resources to manage properly.  
     
   We are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products   
     
  In order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers, we start the manufacturing of our products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers. However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to the customer. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales. Because demand for our products may not materialize, manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs, increased obsolescence and increased operating costs. These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this causes us to have less visibility regarding the accumulated levels of inventory for such customers. A resulting write-off of unusable or excess inventories would adversely affect our operating results.

   Our products are complex and may contain errors which could lead to liability, an increase in our costs and/or a reduction in our revenues   
     
  Our products are complex and may contain errors, particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. Our products are increasingly being designed in more complex processes, include higher levels of software and hardware integration in modules and system-level solutions and/or include elements provided by third parties which further increase the risk of errors. We rely primarily on our in-house testing personnel to design test operations and procedures to detect any errors or vulnerabilities prior to delivery of our products to our customers.  
     
  Should problems occur in the operation or performance of our products, we may experience delays in meeting key introduction dates or scheduled delivery dates to our customers. These errors also could cause us to incur significant re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems. Any defects could result in refunds or other liability or require product replacement or recall. Any of the foregoing could impose substantial costs and harm our business.  
     
  Product liability, data breach or cyber liability claims may be asserted with respect to our products. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the end-products into which they are incorporated. A defect or failure in our product could cause failure in our customer s end-product, so we could face claims for damages that are disproportionately higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. Furthermore, product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to medical and automotive applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. There can be no assurance that any insurance we maintain will sufficiently protect us from any such claims.  
     
   We rely on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products and the failure to successfully manage our relationships with our manufacturers and subcontractors would negatively impact our ability to sell our products   
     
  We do not have our own wafer fab manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we rely on third-party vendors to manufacture the products we design. We also currently rely on Asian third-party assembly subcontractors to assemble and package the silicon chips provided by the wafers for use in final products. Additionally, we rely on these offshore subcontractors for a substantial portion of the testing requirements of our products prior to shipping. We expect utilization of third-party subcontractors to continue in the future.  
     
  The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry drives wide fluctuations in available capacity at third-party vendors. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer demand due to capacity constraints and, therefore, were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. We may be unable to obtain adequate foundry, assembly or test capacity from our third-party subcontractors to meet our customers  delivery requirements even if we adequately forecast customer demand.  
     
  There are significant risks associated with relying on these third-party foundries and subcontractors, including:  
     
                        Failure by us, our customers or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier; 
     
                        Potential insolvency of the third-party subcontractors; 
     
                        Reduced control over delivery schedules and quality; 
     
                        Limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; 
     
                        Potential increases in prices or payments in advance for capacity; 
     
                        Increased need for international-based supply, logistics and financial management; 
     
                        Their inability to supply or support new or changing packaging technologies; and 
     
                        Low test yields.

  We typically do not have long-term supply contracts with our third-party vendors which obligate the vendor to perform services and supply products to us for a specific period, in specific quantities, and at specific prices. Our third-party foundry, assembly and test subcontractors typically do not guarantee that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet demand for our products. In the event that these vendors fail to meet our demand for whatever reason, we expect that it would take up to 12 months to transition performance of these services to new providers. Such a transition may also require qualification of the new providers by our customers or their end customers.  
     
  Most of the silicon wafers for the products that we have sold were manufactured either by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) or TSMC s affiliates or by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). Our customers typically complete their own qualification process. If we fail to properly balance customer demand across the existing semiconductor fabrication facilities that we utilize or are required by our foundry partners to increase, or otherwise change the number of fab lines that we utilize for our production, we might not be able to fulfill demand for our products and may need to divert our engineering resources away from new product development initiatives to support the fab line transition, which would adversely affect our operating results.  
     
   Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales   
     
  Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves testing of the products in the customer s system as well as rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product or software, changes in the IC s manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.  
     
   We have substantial international activities, which subjects us to additional business risks including logistical and financial complexity, political instability and currency fluctuations   
     
  We have established international subsidiaries and have opened offices in international markets to support our activities in Europe and Asia. This has included the establishment of a headquarters in Singapore for non-U.S. operations. The percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the United States was 87% during the nine months ended October 1, 2016. We may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:  
     
                        Complexity and costs of managing international operations and related tax obligations, including our headquarters for non-U.S. operations in Singapore; 
     
                        Protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition in some countries; 
     
                        Difficulties related to the protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries; 
     
                        Multiple, conflicting and changing tax and other laws and regulations that may impact both our international and domestic tax and other liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs; 
     
                        Longer sales cycles; 
     
                        Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods; 
     
                        High levels of distributor inventory subject to price protection and rights of return to us; 
     
                        Political and economic instability; 
     
 42   

Table of Contents   
     
                        Greater difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified technical sales and applications engineers and administrative personnel; and 
     
                        The need to have business and operations systems that can meet the needs of our international business and operating structure. 
     
  To date, substantially all of our sales to international customers and purchases of components from international suppliers have been denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for our international customers to purchase, thus rendering our products less competitive. Similarly, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar could reduce our buying power with respect to international suppliers.  
     
   Our products incorporate technology licensed from third parties   
     
  We incorporate technology (including software) licensed from third parties in our products. We could be subjected to claims of infringement regardless of our lack of involvement in the development of the licensed technology. Although a third-party licensor is typically obligated to indemnify us if the licensed technology infringes on another party s intellectual property rights, such indemnification is typically limited in amount and may be worthless if the licensor becomes insolvent. See  Significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which could seriously harm our business.  Furthermore, any failure of third-party technology to perform properly would adversely affect sales of our products incorporating such technology.  
     
   Our inability to manage growth could materially and adversely affect our business   
     
  Our past growth has placed, and any future growth of our operations will continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded sales, operational and financial enterprise-wide systems, information technology infrastructure, procedures and controls, including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems to manage this growth and maintain compliance with regulatory guidelines, including Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. To the extent our business grows, our internal management systems and processes will need to improve to ensure that we remain in compliance. We also expect that we will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort, and we anticipate that we will require additional management personnel and internal processes to manage these efforts and to plan for the succession from time to time of certain persons who have been key management and technical personnel. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding global operations, including our international headquarters in Singapore, our business could be materially and adversely affected.  
     
   We are subject to risks relating to product concentration   
     
  We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products, is therefore, critical to our future success. In addition, substantially all of our products that we have sold include technology related to one or more of our issued U.S. patents. If these patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our competitors could introduce competitive products that could reduce both the volume and price per unit of our products. Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:  
     
                        A decline in demand for any of our more significant products; 
     
                        Failure of our products to achieve continued market acceptance; 
     
                        Competitive products; 
     
                        New technological standards or changes to existing standards that we are unable to address with our products; 
     
 43   

Table of Contents   
     
                        A failure to release new products or enhanced versions of our existing products on a timely basis; and 
     
                        The failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance. 
     
   We are subject to credit risks related to our accounts receivable   
     
  We do not generally obtain letters of credit or other security for payment from customers, distributors or contract manufacturers. Accordingly, we are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these entities. Our ten largest customers or distributors represent a substantial majority of our accounts receivable. If any such customer or distributor, or a material portion of our smaller customers or distributors, were to become insolvent or otherwise not satisfy their obligations to us, we could be materially harmed.  
     
   We depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed   
     
  We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We believe that our future success will be dependent on retaining the services of our key personnel, developing their successors and certain internal processes to reduce our reliance on specific individuals, and on properly managing the transition of key roles when they occur. There is currently a shortage of qualified personnel with significant experience in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of analog and mixed-signal products. In particular, there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacturability of analog elements, and competition for such personnel is intense. Our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the primary source for our technological and product innovations. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth. The loss of any of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel both in the United States and internationally, including engineers, sales, applications and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products.  
     
   Any dispositions could harm our financial condition   
     
  Any disposition of a product line would entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including:  
     
                        Diversion of management s time and attention from our core business; 
     
                        Difficulties separating the divested business; 
     
                        Risks to relations with customers who previously purchased products from our disposed product line; 
     
                        Reduced leverage with suppliers due to reduced aggregate volume; 
     
                        Risks related to employee relations; 
     
                        Risks associated with the transfer and licensing of intellectual property; 
     
                        Security risks and other liabilities related to the transition services provided in connection with the disposition; 
     
                        Tax issues associated with dispositions; and

   Our stock price may be volatile   
     
  The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors:  
     
                        Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 
     
                        Changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates; 
     
                        Changes in market valuations of other technology companies, particularly semiconductor companies; 
     
                        Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 
     
                        Introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products; 
     
                        The loss of, or decrease in sales to, one or more key customers; 
     
                        A large sale of stock by a significant shareholder; 
     
                        Dilution from the issuance of our stock in connection with acquisitions; 
     
                        The addition or removal of our stock to or from a stock index fund; 
     
                        Departures of key personnel; and 
     
                        The required expensing of stock awards. 
     
  The stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance.  
     
   Most of our current manufacturers, assemblers, test service providers, distributors and customers are concentrated in the same geographic region, which increases the risk that a natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest could disrupt our operations or sales   
     
  Most of our foundries and several of our assembly and test subcontractors  sites are located in Taiwan and most of our other foundry, assembly and test subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region. In addition, many of our customers are located in the Pacific Rim region. The risk of earthquakes in Taiwan and the Pacific Rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines in the area. Earthquakes, tsunamis, fire, flooding, lack of water or other natural disasters, an epidemic, political unrest, war, labor strikes or work stoppages in countries where our semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers and test subcontractors are located, likely would result in the disruption of our foundry, assembly or test capacity. There can be no assurance that alternate capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.  
     
  A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest where our customers  facilities are located would likely reduce our sales to such customers. North Korea s geopolitical maneuverings have created unrest. Such unrest could create economic uncertainty or instability, could escalate to war or otherwise adversely affect South Korea and our South Korean customers and reduce our sales to such customers, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, a significant portion of the assembly and testing of our products occurs in South Korea. Any disruption resulting from these events could also cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembling or testing from the affected subcontractor to another third-party vendor.

   The semiconductor manufacturing process is highly complex and, from time to time, manufacturing yields may fall below our expectations, which could result in our inability to satisfy demand for our products in a timely manner and may decrease our gross margins due to higher unit costs   
     
  The manufacturing of our products is a highly complex and technologically demanding process. Although we work closely with our foundries and assemblers to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance deficiencies, which could lower our gross margins. If our foundries fail to deliver fabricated silicon wafers of satisfactory quality in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers  demand for our products in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.  
     
   We depend on our customers to support our products, and some of our customers offer competing products   
     
  We rely on our customers to provide hardware, software, intellectual property indemnification and other technical support for the products supplied by our customers. If our customers do not provide the required functionality or if our customers do not provide satisfactory support for their products, the demand for these devices that incorporate our products may diminish or we may otherwise be materially adversely affected. Any reduction in the demand for these devices would significantly reduce our revenues.  
     
  In certain products, some of our customers offer their own competitive products. These customers may find it advantageous to support their own offerings in the marketplace in lieu of promoting our products.  
     
   Our debt could adversely affect our operations and financial condition   
     
  We believe we have the ability to service our debt under our credit facilities, but our ability to make the required payments thereunder when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and other factors affecting our operations, including risk factors described under this Item 1A, many of which are beyond our control. Our credit facilities also contain covenants, including financial covenants. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit facilities and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to any applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable.  
     
   We could seek to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future, but additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all   
     
  We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and commitments for at least the next 12 months. However,  our ability to borrow further under the credit facilities is dependent upon our ability to satisfy various conditions, covenants and representations. It is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities or to facilitate acquisitions of other businesses, products, intellectual property or technologies. We believe we could raise these funds, if needed, by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. However, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If we decide to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced.

   We are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase market share   
     
  Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours. In addition, some of our current and potential competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with the decision makers at our current or potential customers. These competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage their customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our products with their products. Our competitors may also offer bundled solutions offering a more complete product despite the technical merits or advantages of our products. These competitors may elect not to support our products which could complicate our sales efforts. These and other competitive pressures may prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors, and may materially harm our business. Competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our gross margins and/or decrease our market share.  
     
   Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent, delay or impede a change in control of us and may reduce the market price of our common stock   
     
  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for:  
     
                        The division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year; 
     
                        The ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of our stockholders; 
     
                        A prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; 
     
                        Elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; 
     
                        A requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders; and 
     
                        A requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. 
     
  We also are subject to the anti-takeover laws of Delaware which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

   Risks related to our industry   
     
   We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has been subject to significant fluctuations   
     
  The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has experienced significant fluctuations, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and new product introductions of both semiconductor companies  and their customers  products and fluctuations in general economic conditions. Deteriorating general worldwide economic conditions, including reduced economic activity, concerns about credit and inflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits, decreased spending and similar adverse business conditions, would make it very difficult for our customers, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or economic recovery. If the economy or markets in which we operate deteriorate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.  
     
  Downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. In the recent past, we believe the semiconductor industry suffered a downturn due in large part to adverse conditions in the global credit and financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increased unemployment rates and general uncertainty regarding the economy. Such downturns may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  
     
  Upturns have been characterized by increased product demand and production capacity constraints created by increased competition for access to third-party foundry, assembly and test capacity. We are dependent on the availability of such capacity to manufacture, assemble and test our products. None of our third-party foundry, assembly or test subcontractors have provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us.  
     
   The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly which may negatively impact our revenues and gross margins   
     
  We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. We have reduced the average unit price of our products in anticipation of or in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. If we are unable to offset any such reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, increasing our sales content per application or reducing production costs, our gross margins and revenues will suffer. To maintain our gross margin percentage, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our costs. Our failure to do so could cause our revenues and gross margin percentage to decline.  
     
   Competition within the numerous markets we target may reduce sales of our products and reduce our market share   
     
  The markets for semiconductors in general, and for mixed-signal products in particular, are intensely competitive. We expect that the market for our products will continually evolve and will be subject to rapid technological change. In addition, as we target and supply products to numerous markets and applications, we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors. We compete with Analog Devices, Conexant, Cypress, IDT, Intel, Marvell Technology Group, Maxim Integrated Products,  MaxLinear, Microchip, Microsemi, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors, Qualcomm, Renesas, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, Vectron International and others. We expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors, other manufacturers and designers of semiconductors, and start-up semiconductor design companies. As the markets for communications products grow, we also may face competition from traditional communications device companies. These companies may enter the mixed-signal semiconductor market by introducing their own products or by entering into strategic relationships with or acquiring other existing providers of semiconductor products. In addition, large companies may restructure their operations to create separate companies or may acquire new businesses that are focused on providing the types of products we produce or acquire our customers.

   We may be the victim of cyber-attacks against our products and our networks, which could lead to liability and damage our reputation and financial results   
     
  Many of our products focus on wireless connectivity and the IoT market and such connectivity may make these products particularly susceptible to cyber-attacks. We routinely face attacks attempting to breach our security protocols, gain access to or disrupt our computerized systems, or steal proprietary company, customer, partner or employee information. These attacks are sometimes successful. We may be subject to security breaches, employee error, theft, malfeasance, phishing schemes, ransomware, faulty password or data security management, or other irregularities. The theft, loss or misuse of personal or business data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Industrial espionage, theft or loss of our intellectual property data could lead to counterfeit products or harm the competitive position of our products and services. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. Federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Attempted or successful attacks against our products and services could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services.  
     
   We may be subject to information technology failures that could damage our reputation, business operations and financial condition   
     
  We rely on information technology for the effective operation of our business. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, theft, physical or electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, or similar events or disruptions. Our security measures may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Any such compromise of our information security could result in the theft or unauthorized publication or use of our confidential business or proprietary information, result in the unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation. In addition, our inability to use or access information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, which could negatively affect our business and operating results.  
     
  Third parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors and customers, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these third parties do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches could result and negatively impact our reputation, business operations and financial results.  
     
   Our products must conform to industry standards and technology in order to be accepted by end users in our markets   
     
  Generally, our products comprise only a part of a device. All components of such devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in affecting industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected which would harm our business.  
     
  Products for certain applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins.

  Our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense. We may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected.  
     
   Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may adversely affect us   
     
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of  conflict  minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These new requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.

Exhibit 10.1   
     
   SILICON LABORATORIES INC.   
    2009 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN    
  (as Amended and Restated on July 21, 2016)  
     
   I.                                             PURPOSE OF THE PLAN  
     
  This Employee Stock Purchase Plan is intended to promote the interests of Silicon Laboratories Inc., a Delaware corporation, by providing Eligible Employees with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation through participation in an employee stock purchase plan designed to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, although the Corporation makes no undertaking nor representation to maintain such qualification.  In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of rights to purchase Common Stock under a Non-423(b) Plan which do not qualify under Section 423(b) of the Code, pursuant to rules, procedures or sub-plans adopted by the Board or Plan Administrator which are designed to achieve tax, securities law or other of the Corporation s compliance objectives in particular locations outside the United States.  This Plan shall govern the terms and conditions of grants made under both the Code Section 423(b) Plan component and the Non-423(b) Plan component.  
     
  Capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the attached Appendix.  
     
   II.                                        ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN  
     
  The Plan Administrator shall have the sole and plenary authority to administer the Plan, including, without limitation, the full authority to interpret and construe any provision of the Plan and, for the grant of rights to purchase Common Stock under the Code Section 423(b) Plan, to adopt such rules and regulations for administering the Plan as it may deem necessary in order to comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.  The Plan Administrator may from time to time grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase Common Stock under the Non-423(b) Plan.  If such grants are intended to be made under the Non-423(b) Plan, they will be designated as such at the time of grant and such grants may not comply with the requirements set forth under Section 423 of the Code. Decisions of the Plan Administrator shall be final and binding on all parties having an interest in the Plan.  The Plan Administrator may from time to time delegate its authority to administer the Plan to one or more officers of the Company, unless constrained by applicable law.  
     
   III.                                   STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN  
     
  A.                                       The stock purchasable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including shares of Common Stock purchased on the open market.  Subject to Article III (B) below, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued in the aggregate under the Plan shall be 1,700,000 shares. 

B.                                       Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation s receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the maximum number and class of securities issuable in the aggregate under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number and class of securities purchasable per Participant and in the aggregate on any one Purchase Date and (iii) the number and class of securities and the price per share in effect under each outstanding purchase right in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits thereunder. 
     
   IV.                                    OFFERING PERIODS  
     
  A.                                       Shares of Common Stock shall be offered for purchase under the Plan through a series of successive offering periods, the first of which began on the last business day in April 2010.  Unless prior to the commencement of an offering period, the Plan Administrator determines that an offering period shall be of a different duration (not to exceed twenty-seven (27) months), each offering period shall be twenty-four (24) months, subject to any automatic reset (as described in Article IV(D) hereof).  Subsequent offering periods shall commence as designated by the Plan Administrator.  The Plan Administrator shall also have the authority to establish additional or alternative sequential or overlapping offering periods, a different duration for one or more offerings or offering periods or different commencement dates for such offering periods with respect to future offerings without stockholder approval if such change is announced prior to the scheduled beginning of the first offering period to be affected thereafter, provided that no offering period shall have a duration exceeding twenty-seven (27) months. 
     
  B.                                       Each offering period shall be comprised of a series of one or more successive and/or overlapping Purchase Intervals having such durations as may be established by the Plan Administrator.  Unless otherwise provided by the Plan Administrator, Purchase Intervals shall run from the last business day in April each year to the last business day in October of the same year and from the last business day in October each year to the last business day in April of the following year. 
     
  C.                                       Should the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on any Purchase Date within an offering period be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the start date of that offering period, then that offering period shall automatically terminate immediately after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on such Purchase Date, and a new offering period shall commence on that day, following such Purchase.  The new offering period shall have a duration of twenty-four (24) months, unless a shorter duration is established by the Plan Administrator within thirty (30) calendar days following the start date of that offering period. 
     
  D.                                       Unless otherwise specified by the Plan Administrator, each offering to Eligible Employees of each Participating Corporation shall be deemed a separate offering, even if the dates and other terms of the applicable offering periods of each such offering are identical and the provisions of the Plan will separately apply to each offering.  To the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(a)(1), the terms of each separate offering need not be identical, provided that the terms of the Plan and an offering together satisfy U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(a)(2) and (a)(3). 
     
 2   

V.                                         ELIGIBILITY  
     
  A.                                       Each individual who is an Eligible Employee on the start date of an offering period under the Plan may enter that offering period on such start date or on any subsequent Semi-Annual Entry Date within that offering period, provided he or she remains an Eligible Employee. 
     
  B.                                       Each individual who first becomes an Eligible Employee after the start date of an offering period may enter that offering period on any subsequent Semi-Annual Entry Date within that offering period on which he or she is an Eligible Employee. 
     
  C.                                       The date an individual enters an offering period shall be designated his or her Entry Date for purposes of that offering period. 
     
  D.                                       To participate in the Plan for a particular offering period, the Eligible Employee must complete (either through the Corporation s online Plan enrollment process or in paper form) the enrollment forms prescribed by the Plan Administrator (including a stock purchase agreement and a payroll deduction authorization) and follow any procedures for enrollment in the Plan as may be established by the Corporation from time to time on or before his or her scheduled Entry Date.  Once an Eligible Employee has enrolled in an offering period, his or her enrollment will remain in effect through subsequent offering periods on the terms then in effect unless the Eligible Employee withdraws from the Plan or ceases to be an Eligible Employee. 
     
   VI.                                    PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS  
     
  A.                                       Except as otherwise provided by the Plan Administrator prior to the commencement of an offering period, the payroll deduction authorized by the Participant for purposes of acquiring shares of Common Stock during an offering period may be any multiple of one percent (1%) of the Participant s Base Salary during each Purchase Interval within that offering period, up to a maximum equal to the  lesser  of (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Participant s Base Salary per pay-period during the applicable Purchase Interval and (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of the Participant s Base Salary that remains after subtracting all other amounts that are to be deducted or withheld from the Participant s Base Salary during such pay-period in the Purchase Interval, provided, however, that a lesser amount of the Participant s remaining Base Salary may be deducted if required to comply with applicable local law.  The deduction rate so authorized shall continue in effect throughout the offering period, except to the extent such rate is changed in accordance with the following guidelines: 
     
  (i)                                        The Participant may, at any time during the offering period, reduce his or her rate of payroll deduction to become effective as soon as possible after completing an amended enrollment form (either through the Corporation s online Plan enrollment process or in paper form).  The Participant may not, however, effect more than one (1) such reduction per Purchase Interval. 
     
  (ii)                                     The Participant may, at any time prior to the third business day preceding the commencement of any new Purchase Interval within the offering period (or within such other period as the Plan Administrator may determine), increase the rate of his or her payroll deduction by completing an amended enrollment form (either through the Corporation s online Plan enrollment process or in paper form). 
     
 3   

The new rate (which may not exceed the twenty-five percent (25%) maximum) shall become effective on the start date of the first Purchase Interval following the completion of such form (either through the Corporation s online Plan enrollment process or in paper form).  
     
  B.                                       Payroll deductions shall begin on the first pay day following the Participant s Entry Date into the offering period and shall (unless sooner terminated by the Participant) continue through the pay day ending with or immediately prior to the last day of that offering period.  The amounts so collected shall be credited to the Participant s book account under the Plan, but no interest shall be paid on the balance from time to time outstanding in such account, unless payment of interest is required under local law in which case the purchase rights will be granted under the Non-423(b) Plan, if necessary under applicable laws or regulations.  The amounts collected from the Participant shall not be required to be held in any segregated account, unless otherwise required under local law (in which case, such rights will be granted under the Non-423(b) Plan if necessary), or trust fund and may be commingled with the general assets of the Corporation and used for general corporate purposes. 
     
  C.                                       Payroll deductions shall automatically cease upon the termination of the Participant s purchase right in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
     
  D.                                       The Participant s acquisition of Common Stock under the Plan on any Purchase Date shall neither limit nor require the Participant s acquisition of Common Stock on any subsequent Purchase Date, whether within the same or a different offering period. 
     
  E.                                        For rights to purchase Common Stock granted under the Non-423(b) Plan, if payroll deductions are not permitted under local law, as determined by the Corporation, Participants may be permitted to contribute to the Plan by an alternative method, as determined by the Corporation.  Alternate methods of contribution may be permitted for purchase rights granted under the Code Section 423(b) Plan to the extent permissible under Code Section 423. 
     
   VII.                               PURCHASE RIGHTS  
     
  A.                                         Grant of Purchase Right .   A Participant shall be granted a separate purchase right for each offering period in which he or she participates.  The purchase right shall be granted on the Participant s Entry Date into the offering period and shall provide the Participant with the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, in a series of successive installments over the remainder of such offering period, upon the terms set forth below.  The Participant shall execute a stock purchase agreement embodying such terms and such other provisions (not inconsistent with the Plan) as the Plan Administrator may deem advisable. 
     
  Under no circumstances shall purchase rights be granted under the Plan to any Eligible Employee if such individual would, immediately after the grant, own (within the meaning of Code Section 424(d)) or hold outstanding options or other rights to purchase, stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Corporation or any Corporate Affiliate.  
     
 4   

B.                                         Exercise of the Purchase Right and Delivery of Shares .   Each purchase right shall be automatically exercised in installments on each successive Purchase Date within the offering period, and shares of Common Stock shall accordingly be purchased on behalf of each Participant (other than Participants whose payroll deductions have previously been refunded pursuant to the Termination of Purchase Right provisions below) on each such Purchase Date.  The purchase shall be effected by applying the Participant s payroll deductions for the Purchase Interval ending on such Purchase Date to the purchase of whole shares of Common Stock at the purchase price in effect for the Participant for that Purchase Date.  As soon as reasonably practicable after each Purchase Date on which a purchase of shares of Common Stock occurs, the Company will arrange the delivery to each Participant of the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her purchase rights in a form determined by the Plan Administrator (in its sole discretion) and pursuant to rules established by the Plan Administrator.  The Company may permit or require that shares of Common Stock be deposited directly with a broker designated by the Company or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Company may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer.  The Company may require that shares of Common Stock be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time, and/or may establish procedures to permit tracking of dispositions of shares. 
     
  C.                                         Purchase Price .   The purchase price per share at which Common Stock will be purchased on the Participant s behalf on each Purchase Date within the offering period shall be established by the Plan Administrator; provided however, that such purchase price shall not be less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the  lower  of (i) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Participant s Entry Date into that offering period or (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on that Purchase Date.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Article III (B) or Article X below, the purchase price per share at which Common Stock will be purchased on the Participant s behalf on each Purchase Date within the offering period shall be equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the  lower  of (i) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Participant s Entry Date into that offering period or (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on that Purchase Date. 
     
  D.                                         Number of Purchasable Shares .   The number of shares of Common Stock purchasable by a Participant on each Purchase Date during the offering period shall be the number of whole shares obtained by dividing the amount collected from the Participant through payroll deductions during the Purchase Interval ending with that Purchase Date by the purchase price in effect for the Participant for that Purchase Date.  However, except as otherwise provided by the Plan Administrator prior to the commencement of an offering period, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock purchasable per Participant on any one Purchase Date during such offering period shall not exceed Four Hundred (400) shares, subject to periodic adjustments in the event of certain changes in the Corporation s capitalization.  In addition, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock purchasable in the aggregate by all Participants on any one Purchase Date under the Plan shall not exceed Three Hundred Thousand (300,000) shares (or such other number designated by the Plan Administrator), subject to periodic adjustments in the event of certain changes in the Corporation s capitalization.  Should the total number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased by all Participants pursuant to outstanding purchase rights on any particular date exceed the maximum share limitation set forth in this paragraph, the Plan Administrator shall make a pro-rata allocation of the available shares on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis.

E.                                          Excess Payroll Deductions .   Any payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of shares of Common Stock on any Purchase Date because they are not sufficient to purchase a whole share of Common Stock may be held for the purchase of Common Stock on the next Purchase Date or promptly refunded following the last day of the Purchase Interval.  However, any payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of Common Stock by reason of the limitation on the maximum number of shares purchasable on the Purchase Date or for any reason other than as described in the foregoing sentence shall be promptly refunded following the last day of the Purchase Interval. 
     
  F.                                           Termination of Purchase Right .   The following provisions shall govern the termination of outstanding purchase rights: 
     
  (i)                                        A Participant may, at any time prior to the third business day preceding the next scheduled Purchase Date in the offering period (or within such other period as the Plan Administrator may determine), withdraw from participation in the Plan by completing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator (or its designate) and by following any other procedures for withdrawing from the Plan as may be established by the Corporation from time to time, and no further payroll deductions shall be collected from the Participant with respect to the withdrawal.  Any payroll deductions collected during the Purchase Interval in which such withdrawal occurs shall, at the Participant s election, be immediately refunded or held for the purchase of shares on the next Purchase Date.  If no such election is made at the time of such withdrawal, then the payroll deductions collected with respect to the terminated right shall be refunded as soon as possible. 
     
  (ii)                                     The termination of such purchase right shall be irrevocable, and the Participant may not subsequently rejoin the offering period for which the terminated purchase right was granted.  In order to resume participation in any subsequent offering period, such individual must re-enroll in the Plan (by timely completing the prescribed enrollment forms) on or before his or her scheduled Entry Date into that offering period. 
     
  (iii)                                  Should the Participant cease to remain an Eligible Employee for any reason (including death, disability or change in status) while his or her purchase right remains outstanding, then that purchase right shall immediately terminate, and all of the Participant s payroll deductions for the Purchase Interval in which the purchase right so terminates shall be immediately refunded.  However, should the Participant cease to remain in active service by reason of an approved unpaid leave of absence, then the Participant shall have the right, exercisable up until the date that is three (3) business days prior to the Purchase Date of the Purchase Interval in which such leave commences (or such other cut-off date as shall be established by the Plan Administrator), to (a) withdraw all the payroll deductions collected to date on his or her behalf for that Purchase Interval or (b) have such funds held for the purchase of shares on his or her behalf on the next scheduled Purchase Date, provided the Participant remains an Eligible Employee on such Purchase Date. 
     
 6   

In no event, however, shall any further payroll deductions be collected on the Participant s behalf during such leave, unless continuation of payroll deductions or other authorized contributions is required under local law, in which case the purchase rights will be granted under the Non-423(b) Plan, if necessary under applicable laws or regulations.  Upon the Participant s return to active service (i) within ninety (90) days following the commencement of such leave or, (ii) prior to the expiration of any longer period for which such Participant s right to reemployment with the Corporation or Corporate Affiliate is guaranteed by either statute or contract, his or her payroll deductions under the Plan shall automatically resume at the rate in effect at the time the leave began.  However, should the Participant s leave of absence exceed ninety (90) days and his or her re-employment rights not be guaranteed by either statute or contract, then the Participant s status as an Eligible Employee will be deemed to terminate on the ninety-first (91st) day of that leave, and such Participant s purchase right for the offering period in which that leave began shall thereupon terminate.  An individual who returns to active employment following such a leave shall be treated as a new Eligible Employee for purposes of the Plan and must, in order to resume participation in the Plan, re-enroll in the Plan (by timely completing the prescribed enrollment forms (either through the Corporation s online Plan enrollment process or in paper form)) on or before his or her scheduled Entry Date into the offering period, unless a re-enrollment requirement would be contrary to local law, in which case the purchase rights will be granted under the Non-423(b) Plan, if necessary under applicable laws or regulations.  
     
  G.                                         Change of Control .   Each outstanding purchase right shall automatically be exercised, prior to the effective date of any Change of Control on a date determined by the Plan Administrator, by applying the payroll deductions of each Participant for the Purchase Interval in which such Change of Control occurs to the purchase of whole shares of Common Stock at the purchase price per share established by the Plan Administrator for the applicable offering period, treating as the Purchase Date for this purpose the date on which shares are purchased prior to the effective date of such Change of Control  The applicable limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable by all Participants in the aggregate shall not apply to any such purchase. 
     
  The Corporation shall use its best efforts to provide at least ten (10)-days prior written notice of the occurrence of any Change of Control, and Participants shall, following the receipt of such notice, have the right to terminate their outstanding purchase rights prior to the effective date of the Change of Control.  
     
  H.                                        Proration of Purchase Rights .   Should the total number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to outstanding purchase rights on any particular date exceed the number of shares then available for issuance under the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall make a pro-rata allocation of the available shares on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, and the payroll deductions of each Participant, to the extent in excess of the aggregate purchase price payable for the Common Stock pro-rated to such individual, shall be refunded. 
     
 7   

I.                                             Assignability .   The purchase right shall be exercisable only by the Participant and shall not be assignable or transferable by the Participant. 
     
  J.                                             Stockholder Rights .   A Participant shall have no stockholder rights with respect to the shares subject to his or her outstanding purchase right until the shares are purchased on the Participant s behalf in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the Participant has become a holder of record of the purchased shares. 
     
  K.                                         Tax Withholding .   At the time a Participant s purchase right is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time a Participant disposes of some or all of the shares of Common Stock he or she acquires under the Plan, the Participant shall make adequate provision for the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations, if any, of the Corporation and/or Corporate Affiliate which arise upon exercise of the purchase right or upon such disposition of shares, respectively.  The Corporation and/or the Corporate Affiliate may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant s compensation or any other payments due the Participant the amount necessary to meet such withholding obligations or withhold from the proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock or any other method of withholding the Corporation and/or the Corporate Affiliate deems appropriate.  The Corporation and/or the Corporate Affiliate shall have the right to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Corporation or a Corporate Affiliate to satisfy withholding obligations for such taxes. 
     
  L.                                          Transfer of Employment .   For purposes of the Plan, the Participant s employment relationship shall be treated as continuing intact upon a transfer between locations of a Participating Corporation or upon a transfer of employment from one Participating Corporation to another Participating Corporation that are each participating in the Code Section 423(b) Plan.  The Plan Administrator may establish other rules to govern transfers of employment between Participating Corporations and between a Participating Corporation in the Code Section 423(b) Plan and a Participating Corporation in the Non-423(b)Plan (or vice versa), consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code, as amended, and the terms of the Plan. 
     
   VIII.                          ACCRUAL LIMITATIONS  
     
  A.                                       No Participant shall be entitled to accrue rights to acquire Common Stock pursuant to any purchase right outstanding under this Plan if and to the extent such accrual, when aggregated with (i) rights to purchase Common Stock accrued under any other purchase right granted under this Plan and (ii) similar rights accrued under other employee stock purchase plans (within the meaning of Code Section 423) of the Corporation or any Corporate Affiliate, would otherwise permit such Participant to purchase more than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) worth of stock of the Corporation or any Corporate Affiliate (determined on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share on the date or dates such rights are granted) for each calendar year such rights are at any time outstanding.  The requirements set forth under this provision will be interpreted and applied to comply with current requirements under Code Section 423. 
     
 8   

B.                                       If by reason of such accrual limitations, any purchase right of a Participant does not accrue for a particular Purchase Interval, then the payroll deductions shall automatically be discontinued and shall resume at the beginning of the first offering period in the next calendar year (if the Participant is then an Eligible Employee). 
     
  C.                                       In the event there is any conflict between the provisions of this Article and one or more provisions of the Plan or any instrument issued thereunder, the provisions of this Article shall be controlling. 
     
   IX.                                   EFFECTIVE DATE, TERM OF THE PLAN AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  
     
  A.                                       The Plan was initially approved by the stockholders of the Corporation on April 23, 2009 and became effective on April 30, 2010.  The inability of the Corporation to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Corporation s legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any shares under the Plan shall relieve the Corporation of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to the exercise of a purchase right, the Corporation may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation, and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Corporation. 
     
  B.                                       Unless sooner terminated by the Board, in its sole discretion, the Plan shall terminate upon the  earlier  of (i) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Plan shall have been sold pursuant to purchase rights exercised under the Plan or (ii) the date on which all purchase rights are exercised in connection with a Change of Control.  No further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised, and no further payroll deductions shall be collected, under the Plan following such termination. 
     
   X.                                        AMENDMENT/TERMINATION OF THE PLAN  
     
  A.                                       The Board may alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time to become effective immediately following the close of any Purchase Interval.  However, the Plan may be amended or terminated immediately upon Board action, if and to the extent necessary the Board or the Plan Administrator, as applicable, determines that such amendment or termination of the Plan is in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders.  Such actions by the Board may include, without limitation, (i) termination of the Plan or any offering period or Purchase Interval, (ii) acceleration of the Purchase Date of any Purchase Interval, (iii) reduction of the discount or change in the method of determining the purchase price in any Purchase Interval or offering period (e.g., by determining the purchase price solely on the basis of the Fair Market Value on the Purchase Date), (iv) reduction in the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any Participant or in the aggregate by all Participants on any Purchase Date or (v) any combination of the foregoing actions. 
     
  B.                                       To the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule), the Corporation shall obtain shareholder approval for such amendment or termination in such a manner and to such a degree as required. 
     
 9   

XI.                                   RULES FOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  
     
  A.                                       The Board or Plan Administrator may adopt rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board or Plan Administrator is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding handling of payroll deductions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, payroll tax, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with local requirements. 
     
  B.                                       The Board or Plan Administrator may also adopt rules, procedures or sub-plans applicable to particular Participating Corporations or locations under the Plan.  The rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Article III (A), but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of this Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-plan. 
     
   XII.                              GENERAL PROVISIONS  
     
  A.                                       Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or any Corporate Affiliate for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation (or any Corporate Affiliate employing such person) or of the Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person s employment at any time for any reason, with or without cause. 
     
  B.                                       The Code Section 423(b) Plan is exempt from the application of Section 409A.  The Non-423(b) Plan is intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code under the short-term deferral exception and any ambiguities shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent.  Except as provided in Article XII (C) hereof, in the case of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent the Plan Administrator determines that a purchase right or the exercise, payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the purchase right shall be granted, exercised, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the date the Plan became effective.  Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation shall have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the purchase right that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto. 
     
  C.                                       Although the Corporation may endeavor to (1) qualify a purchase right for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (2) avoid adverse tax treatment ( e.g. , under Section 409A of the Code), the Corporation makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, anything to the contrary in this Plan, including Article XII (B) hereof, notwithstanding.  The Corporation shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on Participants under the Plan. 
     
 10   

D.                                       All costs and expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan shall be paid by the Corporation; however, each Plan Participant shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such individual in the sale or other disposition of any shares purchased under the Plan. 
     
  E.                                        The provisions of the Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to that State s conflict-of-laws rules.
