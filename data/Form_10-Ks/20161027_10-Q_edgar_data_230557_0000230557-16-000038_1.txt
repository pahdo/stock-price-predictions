NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation 
  As used herein, the "Company,   we,   us,  or  our  refers to Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (the "Parent"), and its subsidiaries, except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires.  Our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements ( Financial Statements ) have been prepared by us in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regarding interim financial reporting.  The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial statement balances, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between the Parent and its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Certain amounts in our prior years' Financial Statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  Such reclassifications had no effect on our net income, stockholders' equity, or cash flows.  
    
  Our Financial Statements reflect all adjustments that, in our opinion, are normal, recurring, and necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Statements cover the   third   quarters ended   September 30, 2016   (   Third Quarter 2016   ) and   September 30, 2015   (   Third Quarter 2015   ) and the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   ("  Nine Months 2016  ") and   September 30, 2015   ("  Nine Months 2015  ").  The Financial Statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP and the SEC for audited annual financial statements.  Results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  Consequently, our Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015 Annual Report   ) filed with the SEC. 

NOTE 2.  Accounting Pronouncements  
  In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-12,   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period   ( ASU 2014-12 ).  ASU 2014-12 requires that performance targets that affect vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as performance conditions.  The adoption of ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter of 2016 did not affect us, as we record expense consistent with the requirements of this accounting update. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ).  ASU 2015-02 affects the following areas:  (i) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (ii) the evaluation of fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; (iii) the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; (iv) the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; and (v) certain investment funds.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016.  Under the new guidance, our limited partnership and tax credit investments are variable interest entities ("VIEs"); however, we are not the primary beneficiary of any of these investments.  As such, the adoption had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  The required disclosures related to our VIEs are included in Note 4.  Investments  below. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ).  ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers with cloud computing arrangements that include a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer's accounting for the software license element of the arrangement is consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer accounts for the arrangement as a service contract.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016, with prospective application.  The impact of this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)   ( ASU 2015-07 ).  ASU 2015-07 provides that investments for which the practical expedient is used to measure fair value at net asset value per share ("NAV") must be removed from the fair value hierarchy.  Instead, those investments must be included as a reconciling line item so that the total fair value amount of investments in the disclosure is consistent with the amount on the balance sheet.  ASU 2015-07 also includes disclosure requirements for investments for which the NAV practical expedient was used to determine fair value.  The adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 did not impact our financial condition or results of operations.

Pronouncements to be effective in the future 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ).  ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early application is permitted.  As the requirements of this literature are disclosure only, ASU 2014-15 will not impact our financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09,   Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts   ( ASU 2015-09 ).  ASU 2015-09 requires companies that issue short duration contracts to disclose additional information, including:  (i) incurred and paid claims development tables; (ii) frequency and severity of claims; and (iii) information about material changes in judgments made in calculating the liability for unpaid claim adjustment expenses, including reasons for the change and the effects on the financial statements.  ASU 2015-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  ASU 2015-09 is to be applied retrospectively by providing comparative disclosures for each period presented, except for those requirements that apply only to the current period.  As the requirements of this literature are disclosure only, the application of this guidance will not impact our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Sub-topic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ).  ASU 2016-01 provides guidance to improve certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  Specifically the guidance:  (i) requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings; (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (iii) eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost; (iv) requires the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; and (v) clarifies that the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to an available-for-sale ("AFS") security should be evaluated with other deferred tax assets.  
    
  ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods.  Early application to financial statements of annual or interim periods that have not yet been issued are permitted as of the beginning of the year of adoption, otherwise early adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ).      ASU 2016-02 requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted.  ASU 2016-02 requires the application of a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  While we are currently evaluating ASU 2016-02, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of this guidance. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including:  (i) income tax consequences; (ii) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; (iii) forfeitures assumptions; and (iv) cash flow classification.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  While we are currently evaluating ASU 2016-09, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13  , Financial Instruments - Credit Losses   ( ASU 2016-13 ).  ASU 2016-13 will change the way entities recognize impairment of financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets, including, among others, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade receivables, and reinsurance receivables.  ASU 2016-13 requires a valuation allowance to be calculated on these financial assets and that they be presented on the financial statements net of the valuation allowance.  The valuation allowance is a measurement of expected losses that is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.  This methodology is referred to as the current expected credit loss model.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years

beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial condition and results of operations.   
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows   ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU 2016-15 adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows including, but not limited to: (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (ii) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies including bank-owned life insurance policies; (iii) distributions received from equity method investees; and (iv) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our statement of cash flows. 

NOTE 3. Statements of Cash Flow 
  Supplemental cash flow information is as follows: 

1   Examples of such corporate actions include non-cash acquisitions and stock splits. 
    
  Included in "Other assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was   $20.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $9.9 million   at   September 30, 2015   of cash received from the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"), which is restricted to pay flood claims under the Write Your Own ("WYO") program.    

NOTE 4. Investments 
  (a) Information regarding our HTM fixed income securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

8 

     Table of Contents  

Unrecognized holding gains and losses of HTM securities are not reflected in the Financial Statements, as they represent fair value fluctuations from the later of:  (i) the date a security is designated as HTM; or (ii) the date that an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) charge is recognized on an HTM security, through the date of the balance sheet.  Our HTM securities had an average duration of   1.6 years   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  (b) Information regarding our AFS securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

Unrealized gains and losses of AFS securities represent fair value fluctuations from the later of:  (i) the date a security is designated as AFS; or (ii) the date that an OTTI charge is recognized on an AFS security, through the date of the balance sheet.  These unrealized gains and losses are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" ("AOCI") on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

9 

     Table of Contents  

(c) The following tables provide information regarding our AFS securities in a net unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

1    Gross unrealized losses include non-OTTI unrealized amounts and OTTI losses recognized in AOCI.   
    
  There were no net unrealized/unrecognized losses on our HTM portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  .  The table below provides our net unrealized/unrecognized loss positions by impairment severity for AFS securities as of   September 30, 2016   and for both AFS and HTM securities as of   December 31, 2015  : 

10 

     Table of Contents  

We do not intend to sell any of the securities in the tables above, nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of these securities.  We have also reviewed these securities under our OTTI policy, as described in Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  within Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  of our   2015 Annual Report  , and have concluded that they are temporarily impaired.  This conclusion reflects our current judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security and underlying collateral.  Additionally, changes in market value due to interest rate fluctuations are considered temporary.  If our judgment about an individual security changes in the future, we may ultimately record a credit loss after having originally concluded that one did not exist, which could have a material impact on our net income and financial position in future periods. 
    
  (d) Fixed income securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below.  Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") are included in the maturity tables using the estimated average life of each security.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
    
  Listed below are the contractual maturities of HTM fixed income securities at   September 30, 2016  : 

Listed below are the contractual maturities of AFS fixed income securities at   September 30, 2016  : 

(e) We evaluate the alternative investments and tax credit investments included in our other investments portfolio to determine whether those investments are VIEs and if so, whether consolidation is required.  A VIE is an entity that either has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities.  We consider several significant factors in determining if our investments are VIEs and if we are the primary beneficiary, including whether we have:  (i) the power to direct activities of the VIE; (ii) the ability to remove the decision maker of the VIE; (iii) the ability to participate in making decisions that are significant to the VIE; and (iv) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  We have determined that the investments in our other investment portfolio are VIEs, but that we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore, consolidation is not required.   
    
  The following table summarizes our other investment portfolio by strategy: 

1   The maximum exposure to loss includes both the carry value of these investments and the related unfunded commitments.  In addition, tax credits that have been previously recognized in Other securities are subject to the risk of recapture, which we do not consider significant.

     Table of Contents  

We do not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of the investments above; however, we are contractually committed to make additional investments up to the remaining commitment outlined above.  We have not provided any non-contractual financial support at any time during 2016 or 2015. 
    
  In addition to the strategy descriptions included in Note 5.  Investments  in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  of our   2015 Annual Report  , our private credit strategy now includes middle market lending, which is a strategy that provides privately negotiated loans to U.S. middle market companies.  Typically, these are floating rate, senior secured loans diversified across industries.  Loans can be made to private equity sponsor-backed companies or non-sponsored companies to finance leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, and acquisitions. 
    
  The following table sets forth gross summarized financial information for our other investments portfolio, including the portion not owned by us.  The majority of these investments are carried under the equity method of accounting.  The last line of the table below reflects our share of the aggregate income or loss, which is the portion included in our Financial Statements.  As the majority of these investments report results to us on a one quarter lag, the summarized financial statement information for the   three and nine-month periods ended June 30   is as follows: 

(f) We have pledged certain AFS fixed income securities as collateral related to our relationships with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY").  In addition, certain securities were on deposit with various state and regulatory agencies at   September 30, 2016   to comply with insurance laws.

Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of the cost of the specific investments sold.  Proceeds from the sale of AFS securities were   $27.0 million   and   $12.7 million   in   Third Quarter 2016   and   Third Quarter 2015  , respectively, and   $132.9 million   and   $170.6 million   in   Nine Months 2016   and   Nine Months 2015  , respectively.  The   $23.6 million   in net realized gains for   Nine Months 2015   were primarily due to a change in our dividend equity strategy from a quantitative, model-driven stock selection strategy to a fundamentally-based stock selection approach that incorporates an assessment of the sustainability and growth rate of a company s dividends and future cash flow.

Ceded premiums and losses related to our participation in the NFIP, under which   100%   of our flood premiums, losses, and loss expenses are ceded to the NFIP, are as follows:   

NOTE 8. Segment Information 
  We classify our business into   four   reportable segments, which are as follows:  

Standard Commercial Lines - comprised of insurance products and services provided in the standard marketplace to 
     commercial enterprises, which are typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government agencies. 

Standard Personal Lines - comprised of insurance products and services, including flood insurance coverage, provided primarily to individuals acquiring coverage in the standard marketplace. 

E S Lines - comprised of insurance products and services provided to customers who have not obtained coverage in 
     the standard marketplace. 

Investments - invests the premiums collected by our insurance operations, as well as our earnings and amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which may include the issuance of debt and equity securities. 
       
  In computing the results of each segment, we do not make adjustments for interest expense or net general corporate expenses. While we do not fully allocate taxes to all segments, we do allocate taxes to our Investments segment as we manage that segment on after-tax results.  We do not maintain separate investment portfolios for the segments and therefore, do not allocate assets to the segments.

NOTE 9. Retirement Plans 
  SICA's primary pension plan is the Retirement Income Plan for Selective Insurance Company of America (the  Pension Plan ).  SICA also sponsors the Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (the  Excess Plan ) and a life insurance benefit plan.  All plans are closed to new entrants and benefits ceased accruing under the Pension Plan and the Excess Plan after March 31, 2016.  For more information concerning SICA's retirement plans, refer to Note 14.  Retirement Plans  in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  of our   2015 Annual Report  .  
    
  The following tables provide information regarding the Pension Plan:    

As of December 31, 2015, we anticipated contributing   $11.7 million   to the Pension Plan for full year 2016.  Actual contributions amounted to   $54.5 million   in Nine Months 2016 and we do not anticipate any additional funding this year.  The decrease in net periodic cost in Third Quarter 2016 reflects lower expense as a result of the contributions that were higher than our original expectation. 

1   This assumption was   4.0%   through March 31, 2016, the date after which benefits ceased accruing for all participants of the Pension Plan. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, the approach used to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plan was changed to provide a more precise measurement of these costs.  Historically, we calculated the service and interest components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.  On January 1, 2016, we elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve over the projected cash flow period.  We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.  The decrease in service cost reflected in the table above is attributable to the discontinuation of benefit accruals for existing participants as of March 31, 2016.

NOTE 11. Litigation 
  In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are named as defendants in various legal proceedings.  Most of these proceedings are claims litigation involving our insurance subsidiaries as either:  (i) liability insurers defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against our customers; or (ii) insurers defending first-party coverage claims brought against them.  We account for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss expense reserves.  We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Our insurance subsidiaries are also from time to time involved in other legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts.  These actions include, among others, putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class.  Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, improper reimbursement of medical providers paid under workers compensation and personal and commercial automobile insurance policies.  Our insurance subsidiaries also are involved from time to time in individual actions in which extra-contractual damages, punitive damages, or penalties are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims.  We believe that we have valid defenses to these cases.  We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition.  Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe the Company was involved in any legal action that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

NOTE 12. Subsequent Events 
  Hurricane Matthew impacted the Southern United States in October 2016.  We currently estimate catastrophe losses from this event to range from   $10 million   to   $14 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, we currently estimate a partial offset of approximately   $1 million   related to the servicing of policies impacted by this event through our participation in the NFIP.

We make forward-looking statements based on currently available information and assume no obligation to update these statements due to changes in underlying factors, new information, future developments, or otherwise. 

Introduction 
  The Parent, through its insurance subsidiaries, offers property and casualty insurance products in the standard and excess and surplus ("E S") marketplaces.  We classify our business into   four   reportable segments, which are as follows:   

Standard Commercial Lines - which represents   79%   of our combined insurance segments' net premiums written ("NPW"), sells commercial lines insurance products and services to businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government agencies located primarily in   22   states in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. and the District of Columbia through approximately 1,160 distribution partners in the standard marketplace. 

Standard Personal Lines - which includes our flood business, represents approximately   12%   of our combined insurance segments' NPW and sells personal lines insurance products and services to individuals located primarily in   13   states through approximately   700   distribution partners in the standard marketplace.  In addition, we have approximately   5,000   distribution partners selling our flood business. 

E S Lines - which represents   9%   of our combined insurance segments' NPW, sells commercial lines insurance products and services in all   50   states and the District of Columbia through approximately   80   distribution partners.  Insurance policies in this segment are sold to customers that typically have business risks with unique characteristics, such as the nature of the business or its claim history and cannot obtain coverage in the standard marketplace.  E S insurers have more flexibility in coverage terms and rates compared to standard market insurers, generally resulting in policies with higher rates and terms and conditions that are more narrowly customized for specific risks. 

Investments - invests the premiums collected by our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E S 
     Lines, as well as our earnings and amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which may include the issuance of debt and equity securities. 
    
  Our Standard Commercial and Standard Personal Lines products and services are written through our nine insurance subsidiaries, some of which write flood business through the Write Your Own ("WYO") program of the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").  
  Our E S products and services are written through one subsidiary, Mesa Underwriters Specialty Insurance Company ("MUSIC").  This subsidiary provides us with a nationally-authorized non-admitted platform to offer insurance products and services to customers who have not obtained coverage in the standard marketplace. 
  Our ten insurance subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the "Insurance Subsidiaries."

The following is Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ) of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition, as well as known trends and uncertainties, that may have a material impact in future periods.  Consequently, investors should read the MD A in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015 Annual Report   ) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
  In the MD A, we will discuss and analyze the following:  
             
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; 
                 
    Results of Operations and Related Information by Segment; 
                
    Federal Income Taxes; 
                
    Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources; 
                
    Ratings; 
                
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; and 
                
    Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities, and Commitments. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include amounts based on our informed estimates and judgments for those transactions that are not yet complete.  Such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements.  Those estimates and judgments most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements involve the following:  (i) reserves for loss and loss expenses; (ii) pension and post-retirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions; (iii) other-than-temporary investment impairments ("OTTI"); and (iv) reinsurance.  These estimates and judgments require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and, therefore, are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop.  If different estimates and judgments had been applied, materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements.  For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies, refer to pages 36 through 47 of our   2015 Annual Report  .

    Operating income is used as an important financial measure by us, analysts, and investors, because the realization of investment gains and losses on sales in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing.  In addition, these realized investment gains and losses, as well as OTTI that are charged to earnings and the results of discontinued operations, could distort the analysis of trends.  See below for a reconciliation of operating income to net income in accordance with GAAP.  Annualized operating ROE is calculated by dividing annualized operating income by average stockholders  equity.

It is our goal to generate an annualized operating ROE that is 300 basis points in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.  At   September 30, 2016  , our weighted-average cost of capital was   7.9%  .  Our annualized ROE contributions by component were as follows:

  Insurance Segments 
  The key metric in understanding our insurance segments  contribution to annualized operating ROE is the GAAP combined ratio.  The following table provides a quantitative foundation for analyzing this ratio:

     Table of Contents  

The GAAP combined ratio increased 2.9 points in   Third Quarter   2016 compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by higher property losses, which were partially offset by favorable prior year casualty reserve development, as illustrated in the table below:  

The GAAP combined ratio improved by 0.5 points in   Nine Months   2016 compared to the same period last year, driven by lower property losses, as last year was heavily impacted by severe winter weather and Midwest storms.  These lower property losses were partially offset by lower favorable prior year casualty development.  Quantitative details are as follows: 

Favorable prior year casualty reserve development by line of business is as follows:                

  For a qualitative discussion of this reserve development, please refer to the respective insurance segment section below in      
  "Results of Operations and Related Information by Segment." 
    
  Also impacting the GAAP combined ratio was an increase in the underwriting expense ratio that was driven by higher supplemental commission expense to our agents, due to improved profitability, which increased the ratio by 0.7 points in   Third Quarter   2016 and 0.8 points in   Nine Months   2016 compared to the same periods last year.  
    
  Investments Segment 
  In total, our investment segment contributed 7.0 points to our overall annualized ROE in   Third Quarter 2016  , compared to 7.5 points in   Third Quarter 2015  , and 6.7 points in   Nine Months 2016  , compared to 8.1 points in   Nine Months 2015  .  The primary driver of the 1.4-point decrease for the year-to-date period was a $13.0 million decrease in pre-tax net realized gains this year compared to last, the timing of which is largely subjective from one period to the next.  
    
  Other 
  Our other expenses, which are primarily comprised of expenses at the holding company level, reduced our overall annualized ROE by 2.5 points in Third Quarter 2016 compared to 2.1 points in Third Quarter 2015 and by 2.8 points in Nine Months 2016 compared to 2.5 points in Nine Months 2015.  The increase in corporate expenses was driven by higher long-term stock-compensation expense to employees, which reflects the Company's improved profitability and the continued strong stock price of the Parent.  Long-term stock compensation expense amounted to $6.6 million in Third Quarter 2016 compared to $4.7 million in Third Quarter 2015 and $22.7 million in Nine Months 2016 compared to $15.8 million in Nine Months 2015.

Outlook 
  A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") projected a 2016 industry statutory combined ratio of 99.2% in their Review   Preview Report issued in February 2016.  This projection included industry catastrophe losses of 4.7 points and favorable reserve development of 1.7 points.  A.M. Best also projected decreasing investment yields to continue into 2016.  
  In 2016, we celebrated our 90   th    year of business and our pillars of success continue to be:  (i) our unique field model combined with sophisticated underwriting and claims capabilities; (ii) true franchise value with our "ivy league"     distribution partners; and (iii) delivering a superior customer experience with our  best in class  employees.  We plan to leverage our competitive advantages by:  (i) increasing our share of wallet with existing agents while adding agents in areas with strong new business opportunities;  and (ii) exploring geographic expansion beginning with Arizona and New Hampshire, which are expected to be operational by the end of 2017 for our standard commercial lines operations.   
  We remain focused on becoming a more customer-centric company.  In 2015, we made key strategic investments in technology as part of our efforts to deliver a superior customer experience across all interactions.  In 2016, we continued to  roll out self-servicing capabilities via our mobile application, mobile web, and on the desktop, and we relaunched our public website with simplified navigation, richer content, and responsive capabilities.  These investments have enabled us to provide our customers with 24/7 access to transactional capabilities and information.  We are also working to identify points of friction in the customer's experience between us and our distribution partners.  These friction points provide opportunities for us to increase efficiency and improve the customer's impression of both us and our distribution partner.  Customers expect this level of service and access from every company with which they conduct business.  We view omni-channel service delivery as a key to future success in our industry and we continue to focus our efforts in this area.   
  For   Nine Months 2016  , our statutory combined ratio was 91.2%, which included 2.1 points of catastrophe losses and 2.9 points of favorable prior year casualty reserve development.  Based on these results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we provide the following guidance for full-year 2016:  
             
    An ex-catastrophe combined ratio of approximately 89.5%.  This assumes no additional prior year casualty reserve development in the fourth quarter;  
                
    3.0 points of catastrophe losses, down from our previous guidance of 3.5 points; 
                
    After-tax investment income of approximately $95 million; and  
                
    Weighted average shares of approximately 58.5 million. 
       
  Our goal is to generate an annualized operating ROE that is 300 basis points in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.  Our weighted average cost of capital was 7.9% as of   September 30, 2016  .  In   Nine Months 2016  , our annualized operating ROE was 10.5%.

The increases in NPW in   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016 compared to   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2015 were driven by:  (i) increases in direct new business; (ii) renewal pure price increases; and (iii) strong retention. 

The NPE increases in   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016 compared to   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2015 were consistent with the fluctuation in NPW for the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The GAAP loss and loss expense ratio increased 4.2 points in   Third Quarter 2016   compared to   Third Quarter 2015   and 0.6 points in   Nine Months 2016   compared to   Nine Months 2015  .  Information regarding these drivers is as follows: 

For additional information regarding the favorable prior year casualty reserve development by line of business, see the "Financial Highlights" section above and the line of business discussions below.  
    
  The increases in the GAAP underwriting expense ratio in the quarter and year-to-date periods of 0.4 points and 1.1 points, respectively, were primarily attributable to higher supplemental commission expense to our distribution partners of approximately 0.9 and 1.0 points, respectively.  
    
  The following is a discussion of our most significant Standard Commercial Lines of business and their respective statutory results:

     Table of Contents  

The statutory combined ratio decrease in   Third Quarter   2016 compared to Third Quarter 2015 was driven by favorable prior year casualty reserve development as illustrated in the tables below: 

The significant drivers of the development were as follows:  

Third Quarter   and   Nine Months     2015  :  Development was primarily attributable to lower claims frequencies and severities in the 2009 through 2013 accident years.  

The 10.0-point increase in the statutory combined ratio in   Third Quarter 2016   compared to   Third Quarter 2015  , and the 7.4-point increase in the statutory combined ratio in   Nine Months 2016   compared to   Nine Months 2015  , were primarily due to:    (i) higher unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development;  (ii) an increase in the current year loss reserve estimate; and (iii) higher non-catastrophe property losses. 
    
  Quantitative information regarding the development and non-catastrophe property losses is as follows:    

Unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016 was primarily due to higher severities in the 2013 and 2014 accident years coupled with higher claims frequencies in the 2015 accident year.  The increase in the current year casualty reserve estimate in Third Quarter and Nine Months 2016 was driven by higher than expected claim frequencies.

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in the statutory combined ratio in   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016 compared to the same prior year periods were due to favorable prior year casualty reserve development, as illustrated in the tables below, and policyholder dividends that were down 2.3 points in the quarter and 1.4 points in the year-to-date period, compared to the same periods last year.  
    
  Information regarding prior year casualty reserve development is as follows:  

Favorable prior year casualty reserve development in the quarter and year-to-date periods related primarily to lower severities in accident years 2014 and prior.  We believe these claim outcome improvements are due, in part, to lower medical inflation than originally anticipated and the various claims initiatives that we have implemented, including, but not limited to, the centralization of workers compensation claims handling, the implementation of a strategic case management unit for the handling of workers compensation claims with high exposure and/or significant escalation risk, and more proactive case management in the areas of medical, pharmaceutical, and physical therapy treatments.  For more information regarding the initiatives that we have undertaken regarding this line of business, refer to the Standard Market Workers Compensation Line of Business discussion within the Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses section of "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of our 2015 Annual Report.

The fluctuations in the statutory combined ratio in   Third Quarter 2016   compared to   Third Quarter 2015   and in Nine Months 2016 compared to Nine Months 2015 were driven by the following:  

The increase in non-catastrophe property losses in Third Quarter 2016 was driven by higher fire and weather-related losses than in Third Quarter 2015, reflecting volatility from period to period that is normally associated with our commercial property line of business. 

Standard Personal Lines 

The NPW in Third Quarter 2016 was flat compared to Third Quarter 2015, while on a year-to-date basis new business was not sufficient to compensate for the attrition reflected in the 2016 retention ratios illustrated in the table below. 

The NPE decreases in   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016 compared to   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2015 were consistent with the fluctuations in NPW for the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2015  .

The GAAP loss and loss expense ratio decreased 8.3 points in   Third Quarter 2016   compared to   Third Quarter 2015   and 13.3 points in   Nine Months 2016   compared to   Nine Months 2015  . These decreases were driven by lower property losses and flood claims handling fees related to the flooding in Louisiana in Third Quarter 2016.  The quantitative breakout of these drivers   were as follows:  

The increase in the GAAP underwriting expense ratio in the quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily driven by increased costs associated with:  (i) capital technology improvements; (ii) underwriting expenses from third-party data vendors; and (iii) higher supplemental commission expense to our distribution partners.  Additionally, the GAAP underwriting expense ratio increased in Third Quarter 2016 compared to Third Quarter 2015, due to a year-to-date reallocation of overhead expenses to Standard Commercial Lines to match actual production in the Third Quarter 2015.  

E S Insurance Operations 

We continue to focus on profitability drivers in our E S operations and have achieved price increases of 5.8% in the quarter and 4.8% in the year-to-date period.  In this competitive marketplace, this focus has put pressure on NPW, which was down 2%, to $53 million, in the quarter and up 13%, to $154.9 million, in the year-to-date period.  Quantitative information is as follows:

The NPE increases in   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016, compared to   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2015, were consistent with the fluctuations in NPW for the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The GAAP loss and loss expense ratio remained flat in   Third Quarter 2016   and increased 1.1 points in   Nine Months 2016   compared to the same prior year periods.  Both periods included a 3.7-point increase in current year loss costs, as well as the following: 

The GAAP underwriting expense ratio decreased 2.8 points in   Nine Months 2016  , compared to Nine Months 2015, primarily due to the following: 

1.8-point reduction in   Nine Months 2016   from a lower annual cash incentive plan payment for employees in this segment based on 2015 underwriting results; and 

0.7-point decrease in   Nine Months 2016   from lower commission expenses to our distribution partners reflecting a change in the mix of business written in this segment, as well as lower supplemental commission expense.  
       
  We are working to improve the results in this segment of our business by implementing targeted price increases, underwriting changes, and the integration of claims handling functions into our corporate operations to improve claims outcomes.  For more information regarding the initiatives that we have undertaken, refer to the E S Lines discussion within the Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses section of "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of our 2015 Annual Report.  We believe these initiatives will position this segment for improved results in the coming years. 

Reinsurance 
  We have successfully completed negotiations of our July 1, 2016 excess of loss treaties, which provide coverage for our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E S Lines.  The renewal of these treaties included some enhancements in terms and conditions, with the same structure as the expiring treaties as follows: 
    
  Property Excess of Loss 
  The property excess of loss treaty ("Property Treaty") provides $58.0 million of coverage in excess of a $2.0 million retention: 
             
    The per occurrence cap on the first and second layers is $84.0 million. 
                
    The first layer has unlimited reinstatements and a limit of $8.0 million in excess of $2.0 million.   
                 
    A third layer has a limit of $20.0 million excess of $40.0 million with an annual aggregate limit of approximately $70.0 million. 
                
    The Property Treaty excludes nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological ("NBCR") terrorism losses.

     Table of Contents  

Casualty Excess of Loss 
  The casualty excess of loss treaty ( Casualty Treaty ) provides $88.0 million of coverage in excess of a $2.0 million retention: 
             
    The first through sixth layers provide coverage for 100% of up to $88.0 million in excess of a $2.0 million retention. 
                
    The Casualty Treaty includes a $25.0 million limit, per life, on our workers compensation business, which is a $4.0 million increase from the prior treaty. 
                
    The Casualty Treaty excludes NBCR terrorism losses and has annual aggregate non-NBCR terrorism limits of $208.0 million. 

Investments 
   
  Our investment philosophy includes certain return and risk objectives for the fixed income, equity, and other investment portfolios.  After-tax yield and income generation are key drivers to our investment strategy, which has historically been balanced with a long-term  buy-and-hold,  low turnover approach.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we will be implementing a change to our fixed income strategy to more actively manage the portfolio to maximize after-tax income and total return, while maintaining a similar level of credit quality and duration risk.  We have evaluated our existing strategy in the context of the current market environment, and concluded that this change was necessary to more effectively navigate and manage the portfolio in response to the persistently low interest rate environment. 

The increase in invested assets at   September 30, 2016   compared to December 31, 2015 was driven by higher unrealized gains, primarily on our fixed income securities portfolio, as well as operating cash flow of $177.5 million.  During   Nine Months 2016  , interest rates on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note fell by 68 basis points, which drove a $105.6 million increase in unrealized gains on the fixed income securities portfolio.  While the low interest rate environment favorably impacts our unrealized position, it presents a challenge to us in generating after-tax return, as new purchase yields are below the average yield on bonds that are currently maturing.  Additionally, the increase in unrealized gains resulted in an $0.08 reduction in our invested assets per dollar of stockholders' equity in Nine Months 2016.  

Fixed Income Securities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our fixed income securities portfolio represented 92% of our total invested assets, compared to our   December 31, 2015   allocation of 91%.  The average duration of the fixed income securities portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   was   3.7   years, including short-term investments, compared to the Insurance Subsidiaries  liability duration of approximately   4.3   years.  The current duration of the fixed income securities portfolio is within our historical range, and is monitored and managed to maximize yield while managing interest rate risk at an acceptable level.  We maintain a well-diversified portfolio across sectors, credit quality, and maturities that affords us ample liquidity.  Every purchase or sale is made with the intent of maximizing risk-adjusted investment returns in the current market environment while balancing capital preservation.  Our fixed income securities portfolio had a weighted average credit rating of "AA-" as of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  

The sector composition and credit quality of our major asset categories within our fixed income securities portfolio did not significantly change from   December 31, 2015  .  Our top 10 state exposures represented 54% of the total municipal bond portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and had an average rating of "AA."  A portion of our municipal bond portfolio contains insurance enhancements; however, the ratings of the securities with and without insurance remained unchanged as we generally purchase securities based on their underlying credit quality.  For details regarding this credit quality information, see Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  of our 2015 Annual Report.

Net Investment Income 
  The components of net investment income earned for the indicated periods were as follows: 

Income on our fixed income securities portfolio increased in both   Third Quarter   and   Nine Months   2016, reflecting a higher asset base in this portfolio.  

Realized Gains and Losses 
  Our general philosophy for sales of securities is to reduce our exposure to securities and sectors based on economic evaluations and when the fundamentals for that security or sector have deteriorated, or to opportunistically trade out of securities to other securities with better economic return characteristics.  Net realized gains for the indicated periods were as follows:  

Net realized gains excluding OTTI in   Nine Months 2015   reflect the sale of AFS equity securities related to a change in our dividend strategy from a quantitative, model-driven stock selection strategy to a fundamentally-based stock selection approach. 
    
  For further discussion of our realized gains and losses, as well as our OTTI methodology, see Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  of our   2015 Annual Report  .  For additional information about our OTTI charges,  see Note 4. "Investments" in Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q. 

Federal Income Taxes 
  The following table provides information regarding federal income taxes: 

The effective tax rate remained relatively stable with the comparable prior year periods, as tax-advantaged income remained flat compared to the fluctuation in overall pre-tax income.  The effective federal income tax rate differs from the normal statutory rate primarily as a result of recurring non-taxable items, such as tax-advantaged interest and dividends received deduction.       
    
  We believe that our future effective tax rate will continue to be impacted by similar items, assuming no significant changes to tax laws occur that would impact our tax-advantaged investments.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
  Capital resources and liquidity reflect our ability to generate cash flows from business operations, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. 
    
  Liquidity 
  We manage liquidity with a focus on generating sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of our business operations.  Our cash and short-term investment position of   $171 million   at   September 30, 2016   was comprised of   $23 million   at the Parent and   $148 million   at the Insurance Subsidiaries.  Short-term investments are generally maintained in "AAA" rated money market funds approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  The Parent maintains a fixed income security investment portfolio containing high-quality, highly-liquid government and corporate fixed income securities.  This portfolio amounted to   $75 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $62 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Sources of Liquidity 
  Sources of cash for the Parent have historically consisted of dividends from the Insurance Subsidiaries, the investment portfolio discussed above, borrowings under lines of credit and loan agreements with certain Insurance Subsidiaries, and the issuance of stock and debt securities.  We continue to monitor these sources, giving consideration to our long-term liquidity and capital preservation strategies. 
    
  Insurance Subsidiary Dividends 
  We currently anticipate that the Insurance Subsidiaries will pay   $61 million   in total dividends to the Parent in 2016.  Cash dividends of   $46 million   were paid during   Nine Months 2016  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , our allowable ordinary maximum dividend was   $178 million   for 2016. 
    
  Any dividends to the Parent are subject to the approval and/or review of the insurance regulators in the respective Insurance Subsidiaries' domiciliary states and are generally payable only from earned surplus as reported in the statutory annual statements of those subsidiaries as of the preceding December 31.  Although past dividends have historically been met with regulatory approval, there is no assurance that future dividends that may be declared will be approved.  Indiana state regulators passed legislation revising the calculation to determine an extraordinary dividend, which became effective on July 1, 2016.  For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, refer to Note 19.  Statutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds  in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  of our 2015 Annual Report. 
  The Insurance Subsidiaries generate liquidity through insurance float, which is created by collecting premiums and earning investment income before losses are paid.  The period of the float can extend over many years.  Our investment portfolio consists of maturity dates that continually provide a source of cash flows for claims payments in the ordinary course of business.  The duration of the fixed income securities portfolio, including short-term investments, was 3.7 years as of   September 30, 2016  , while the liabilities of the Insurance Subsidiaries have a duration of   4.3   years.  As protection for the capital resources at the Insurance Subsidiaries, we purchase reinsurance coverage for any significantly large claims or catastrophes that may occur during the year. 
    
  Line of Credit 
  The Parent's line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB T) (referred to as our "Line of Credit"), was renewed effective December 1, 2015 with a borrowing capacity of $30 million, which can be increased to $50 million with the approval of both lending partners.  This Line of Credit expires on December 1, 2020 and has an interest rate which varies and is based on, among other factors, the Parent's debt ratings.  There were no balances outstanding under the Line of Credit at   September 30, 2016   or at any time during 2016.  
    
  The Line of Credit agreement contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including, without limitation, financial covenants under which we are obligated to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, a minimum combined statutory surplus, and a maximum ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization, as well as covenants limiting our ability to:  (i) merge or liquidate; (ii) incur debt or liens; (iii) dispose of assets; (iv) make certain  investments and acquisitions; and (v) engage in transactions with affiliates.

The table below outlines information regarding certain of the covenants in the Line of Credit:

    Calculated in accordance with the Line of Credit agreement. 
       
  Several of our Insurance Subsidiaries are members of certain branches of the Federal Home Loan Bank, which provides those subsidiaries with additional access to liquidity.  Membership is as follows: 
                 Branch 
    Insurance Subsidiary Member 
      Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") 
    Selective Insurance Company of South Carolina ("SICSC")   1  
  Selective Insurance Company of the Southeast ("SICSE")   1  
      Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY") 
    Selective Insurance Company of America ("SICA") 
  Selective Insurance Company of New York ("SICNY") 

1   These subsidiaries are jointly referred to as the "Indiana Subsidiaries" as they are domiciled in Indiana. 
    
  The Line of Credit permits aggregate borrowings from the FHLBI and the FHLBNY up to 10% of the respective member company s admitted assets for the previous year.  Additionally, the FHLBNY limits borrowings by SICA and SICNY to 5% of admitted assets for the previous year.  All borrowings from both the FHLBI and the FHLBNY are required to be secured by investments pledged as collateral.  For additional information regarding collateral outstanding, refer to Note 4. "Investments" in Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q.  The following table provides information on the remaining capacity for Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings based on these restrictions, as well as the amount of additional stock that would need to be purchased to allow these member companies to borrow their remaining capacity:    

Intercompany Loan Agreements 
  The Parent has lending agreements with the Indiana Subsidiaries that have been approved by the Indiana Department of Insurance, which provide additional liquidity to the Parent.  Similar to the Line of Credit agreement, these lending agreements limit borrowings by the Parent from the Indiana Subsidiaries to 10% of the admitted assets of the respective Indiana Subsidiary.  The following table provides information on the Parent s borrowings and remaining borrowing capacity from the Indiana Subsidiaries: 

Short-term Borrowings 
  In   Nine Months 2016  , SICA borrowed an aggregate of $105 million from the FHLBNY, of which $55 million has already matured and has been paid.  The remaining $50 million is due in 2021.  For further information regarding these and other borrowings, see Note 5. "Indebtedness" in Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Capital Market Activities 
  The Parent had no private or public issuances of stock or debt instruments during   Nine Months 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Uses of Liquidity 
  The liquidity generated from the sources discussed above is used, among other things, to pay dividends to our shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the Parent's common stock are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other relevant factors.  On October 26, 2016, our Board of Directors declared, for stockholders of record as of November 15, 2016, a $0.16 per share dividend to be paid on December 1, 2016.  This is a 7% increase compared with the dividend declared on July 27, 2016.  
    
  Our ability to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations on our debt, as well as our ability to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders, is dependent on liquidity at the Parent coupled with the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to pay dividends, if necessary, and/or the availability of other sources of liquidity to the Parent.  We have a scheduled repayment of our $45 million outstanding borrowing from the FHLBI in December 2016, which we anticipate refinancing.  Subsequent to that payment, our next principal debt repayment is due in 2021.   
    
  Restrictions on the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends, without alternative liquidity options, could materially affect our ability to service debt and pay dividends on common stock. 
    
  Capital Resources 
  Capital resources provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks, and facilitate continued business growth.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had statutory surplus of $1.6 billion and GAAP stockholders  equity of   $1.6 billion  .  With total debt of   $424 million  , our debt-to-capital ratio was approximately   21%  .  
    
  Our cash requirements include, but are not limited to, principal and interest payments on various notes payable, dividends to stockholders, payment of claims, payment of commitments under limited partnership agreements and capital expenditures, as well as other operating expenses, which include commissions to our distribution partners, labor costs, premium taxes, general and administrative expenses, and income taxes.  For further details regarding our cash requirements, refer to the section below entitled,  Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities, and Commitments.  
    
  We continually monitor our cash requirements and the amount of capital resources that we maintain at the holding company and operating subsidiary levels.  As part of our long-term capital strategy, we strive to maintain capital metrics, relative to the macroeconomic environment, that support our targeted financial strength.  Based on our analysis and market conditions, we may take a variety of actions, including, but not limited to, contributing capital to the Insurance Subsidiaries in our insurance operations, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing shares of the Parent s common stock, and increasing stockholders  dividends. 
    
  Our capital management strategy is intended to protect the interests of the policyholders of the Insurance Subsidiaries and our stockholders, while enhancing our financial strength and underwriting capacity. 
    
  Book value per share increased to   $27.22   as of   September 30, 2016  , up from   $24.37   as of   December 31, 2015  , due to   $2.03   in net income and   $1.19   in unrealized gains on our investment portfolio, partially offset by   $0.45   in dividends to our shareholders. 

Ratings 
  We are rated by major rating agencies that issue opinions on our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet policyholder obligations.  We believe that our ability to write insurance business is most influenced by our rating from A.M. Best.  We have been rated  A  or higher by A.M. Best for the past 86 years.  A downgrade from A.M. Best to a rating below  A-  is an event of default under our Line of Credit and could affect our ability to write new business with customers and/or distribution partners, some of whom are required (under various third-party agreements) to maintain insurance with a carrier that maintains a specified A.M. Best minimum rating. 
    
  On October 25, 2016, S P Global Ratings ("S P") upgraded our financial strength rating to "A" from "A-" with a stable outlook.  This rating reflects S P's view of our strong business risk profile and strong financial risk profile, built on our strong competitive position and very strong capital and earnings.  In addition, our stable outlook reflects S P's expectation that we will sustain our strong competitive position and operating performance.

Our other ratings have not changed from those reported in our "Ratings" section of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." in our 2015 Annual Report and continue to be as follows:

Our S P, Moody's, and Fitch financial strength and associated credit ratings affect our ability to access capital markets.  The interest rate on our Line of Credit varies and is based on, among other factors, the Parent's debt ratings.  There can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed.  It is possible that positive or negative ratings actions by one or more of the rating agencies may occur in the future. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, also referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  As such, we are not exposed to any material financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 

Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities, and Commitments 
  Our future cash payments associated with:  (i) loss and loss expense reserves; (ii) contractual obligations pursuant to operating leases for office space and equipment; and (iii) notes payable have not materially changed since   December 31, 2015  .  As of September 30, 2016, we had contractual obligations that expire at various dates through 2030 that may require us to invest up to an additional $134 million in alternative and other investments. There is no certainty that any such additional investment will be required.  Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had contractual obligations that expire in 2019 to invest $12.9 million in a non-publicly traded common stock within our AFS portfolio.  We expect to have the capacity to repay and/or refinance these obligations as they come due. 
    
  We have issued no material guarantees on behalf of others and have no trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value.  We have no material transactions with related parties other than those disclosed in Note 16. "Related Party Transactions" included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our   2015 Annual Report  . 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
  There have been no material changes in the information about market risk set forth in our   2015 Annual Report  . 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, who has assumed certain additional responsibilities related to disclosure controls and procedures in the absence of a sitting Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  In performing this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in   Internal Control       Integrated Framework   ("COSO Framework")     in 2013.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are:  (i) effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act; and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during   Nine Months 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
  In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are named as defendants in various legal proceedings.  Most of these proceedings are claims litigation involving our Insurance Subsidiaries as either:  (i) liability insurers defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against our customers; or (ii) insurers defending first-party coverage claims brought against them.  We account for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss expense reserves.  We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Our Insurance Subsidiaries are also from time to time involved in other legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts.  These actions include, among others, putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class.  Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, improper reimbursement of medical providers paid under workers compensation and personal and commercial automobile insurance policies.  Our Insurance Subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in individual actions in which extra-contractual damages, punitive damages, or penalties are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims.  We believe that we have valid defenses to these cases.  We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition.  Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe the Company was involved in any legal action that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
  Certain risk factors exist that can have a significant impact on our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings.  The impact of these risk factors also could impact certain actions that we take as part of our long-term capital strategy, including but not limited to, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our equity securities, redeeming our fixed income securities, or increasing or decreasing stockholders dividends.  We operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time.  Consequently, we can neither predict such new risk factors nor assess the potential future impact, if any, they might have on our business.  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A.  Risk Factors.  in our 2015 Annual Report. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
  The following table provides information regarding our purchases of our common stock in   Third Quarter 2016  : 

1   During   Third Quarter 2016  ,   14,385   shares were purchased from employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units.  These repurchases were made to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to those employees.  These shares were not purchased as part of any publicly announced program.  The shares that were purchased in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units were purchased at fair market value as defined in the Selective Insurance Group, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Stock Plan and the Selective Insurance Group, Inc. 2005 Omnibus Stock Plan As Amended and Restated Effective as of May 1, 2010.
