

  WEATHERFORD INTERNATIONAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.  General 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Weatherford International plc (the  Company ) are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which, in our opinion, are necessary to present fairly our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . When referring to  Weatherford  and using phrases such as  we,   us,  and  our,  the intent is to refer to Weatherford International plc, a public limited company organized under the law of Ireland, and its subsidiaries as a whole or on a regional basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made. 
  Although we believe the disclosures in these financial statements are adequate, certain information relating to our organization and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable, lower of cost or market of inventories, equity investments, intangible assets and goodwill, property, plant and equipment, income taxes, percentage-of-completion accounting for long-term contracts, self-insurance, foreign currency exchange rates, pension and post-retirement benefit plans, disputes, litigation, contingencies and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  We consolidate all wholly-owned subsidiaries, controlled joint ventures and variable interest entities where the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary. Investments in affiliates in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation related to the adoption of new accounting standards. Net income and shareholders  equity were not affected by these reclassifications. See    Note 18   New Accounting Pronouncements    for additional details. 
    
  Currency Devaluation Charges    
    
   Currency devaluation charges are included in current earnings in    Currency Devaluation Charges    on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , currency devaluation charges reflect the impact of the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza of   $31 million  . In the   third quarter   of   2015  , currency devaluation charges of   $26 million   reflect the impact of the   $20 million   devaluation of the Angolan kwanza and   $6 million   related to the depreciated Kazakhstani tenge. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , currency devaluation charges of   $68 million   reflect the impacts of the   $36 million   devaluation of the Angolan kwanza, the recognized remeasurement charges of   $26 million   related to the Venezuelan bolivar and   $6 million   related to the depreciated Kazakhstani tenge.

2.  Restructuring Charges  
    
  In response to continuing fluctuation of crude oil prices and our anticipation of a lower level of exploration and production spending in 2016, we initiated an additional plan to reduce our overall costs and workforce to better align with anticipated activity levels. This cost reduction plan (the    2016 Plan   ) included a workforce reduction and other cost reduction measures initiated across our geographic regions.  
    
  In connection with the   2016 Plan  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $22 million   and   $150 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, which include termination (severance) benefits of   $18 million   and   $126 million  , respectively, and other restructuring charges of   $4 million   and   $24 million  , respectively. Other restructuring charges include contract termination costs, relocation and other associated costs.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced a cost reduction plan (the    2015 Plan   ), which included a worldwide workforce reduction and other cost reduction measures. In the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $49 million   and   $159 million   for the   2015 Plan  , which include termination (severance) benefits of   $40 million   and   $99 million  , respectively, and other restructuring charges of   $9 million   and   $60 million  , respectively. Other restructuring charges for the   nine   months of 2015 include asset write-offs of   $23 million   related to Yemen due to the political disruption and   $28 million   in other regions. Other restructuring charges also include contract termination costs, relocation and other associated costs. 
    
  The following tables present the components of the   2016 Plan   and the   2015 Plan   restructuring charges by segment for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  .

The severance and other restructuring charges gave rise to certain liabilities, the components of which are summarized below and largely relate to the severance accrued as part of the plans mentioned previously as well as our 2014 cost reduction plan (the  2014 Plan ) that will be paid pursuant to the respective arrangements and statutory requirements.

3.  Percentage-of-Completion Contracts 
    
  We account for our long-term early production facility construction contracts in Iraq under the percentage-of-completion method. In the   third quarter   of   2016   and in the nine months of 2016 we are break-even for our Zubair contract. Cumulative estimated loss from the Iraq contracts was   $532 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  On May 26, 2016, we entered into an agreement with our customer containing the terms and conditions of the settlement on the Zubair contract. The settlement to be paid to us is a gross amount of   $150 million  , of which   $62 million   and   $72 million   was received in the second and third quarters of 2016, respectively. The settlement includes variation order requests, claims for extension of time, payments of remaining contract milestones and new project completion timelines that resulted in relief from the liquidated damages provisions. Of the remaining gross settlement, we expect to collect the last   $16 million   in the first quarter of 2017. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have no claims revenue, and our percentage-of-completion project estimate includes a cumulative   $25 million   in approved change orders and   $25 million   of back charges. Our net billings in excess of costs as of   September 30, 2016   were   $46 million   and are shown in the  Other Current Liabilities  line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
    
  In the   third quarter   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized estimated project losses of   $44 million   and   $71 million  , respectively, related to our long-term early production facility construction contracts in Iraq accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.   Cumulative   estimated losses on these projects were   $450 million   at   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2015  , our percentage-of-completion project estimates included     $144 million   of claims revenue and   $21 million   of back charges. Our costs in excess of billings were   $93 million   and were included in the  Other Current Assets  line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

4.  Accounts Receivable Factoring and Other Receivables 
    
  We sold accounts receivable of   $25 million   in the third quarter of   2016   and   $102 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and received cash of   $25 million   in the third quarter of   2016   and   $101 million   for the nine months of   2016  . The loss recognized on these sales was   $0.1 million   in the third quarter and   $0.4 million   for the nine months of 2016. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold   $28 million   of accounts receivable and recognized a loss of   $0.1 million  . Our factoring transactions in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were recognized as sales, and the proceeds are included in operating cash flows in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we accepted a note with a face value of   $120 million   from Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. ( PDVSA ) in exchange for   $120 million   in net trade receivables. The note has a   three   year term at a   6.5%   stated interest rate. We may decide to sell this note in the future and have classified the note in  Other Non-Current Assets  on the accompanying   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . We carry the note at lower of cost or fair value and recognized a loss in the second quarter of 2016 of   $84 million   to adjust the note to fair value.

5.  Inventories, Net 
    
  Inventories, net of reserves, by category were as follows: 

In the nine months of 2016, we recognized charges primarily for excess and obsolete inventory of   $213 million  , with   $115 million   in North America,   $27 million   in MENA/Asia Pacific,   $34 million   in Europe/SSA/Russia,   $28 million   in Latin America and   $9 million   in   Land Drilling Rigs  . These charges were largely attributable to downturn in the oil and gas industry, where certain inventory has been deemed commercially unviable or technologically obsolete considering current and future demand.    

6.  Long-Lived Asset Impairments 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of   $436 million   of which   $388 million   was related to our product line asset impairments and   $48 million   was related to the impairment of intangible assets. The product line impairment charges were related to our MENA Pressure Pumping and U.S. Well Construction, Drilling Services and Secure Drilling Service product lines. The intangible asset charge is related to the Well Construction and Completions businesses with   $35 million   attributable to the North America segment and   $13 million   related the Europe/SSA/Russia segment.  These impairment charges were attributed to the following segments:   $235 million   in North America,   $109 million   in MENA/Asia Pacific,   $12 million   in Europe/SSA/Russia,   $16 million   in Latin America and   $16 million   in Land Drilling Rigs.   
    
  The impairments were due to the prolonged downturn in the oil and gas industry, whose recovery in the third quarter was not as strong as expected and whose recovery in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017 is expected to be slower than had previously been anticipated.  The change in the expectations of the market s recovery, in addition to successive negative operating cash flows in certain asset groups represented an indicator that those assets will no longer be recoverable over their remaining useful lives.      Based on the presence of these impairment indicators, we performed an analysis of those asset groups and recorded long-lived asset impairment charges to adjust the assets to fair value. See    Note 10   Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Assets and Equity Investments    for additional information regarding the fair value determination.  
    
  In the second quarter of 2015, we recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of   $124 million   in our pressure pumping assets of our North America segment. We recognized total long-lived impairment charges due to the continued weakness in crude oil prices contributing to lower exploration and production spending and a decline in the utilization of our assets. The decline in oil prices and its impact on demand represented a significant adverse change in the business climate and an indication that these long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Based on the presence of impairment indicators, we performed an analysis of these asset groups and recorded long-lived asset impairment charges to adjust the assets to fair value. See    Note 10   Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Assets and Equity Investments    for additional information regarding the fair value determination. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2015, we prepared analyses to determine the fair value of our equity investments in less than majority owned entities. Upon completion of these valuations, we determined that the fair value attributable to certain equity investments were significantly below its carrying value. We assessed this decline in value as other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss of   $20 million  . See    Note 10   Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Assets and Equity Investments    for additional information regarding the fair value determination.

8.  Short-term Borrowings and Other Debt Obligations 

Revolving Credit Facility and Secured Term Loan Agreement 
    
  We have a revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Agreement ) in the amount of   $1.38 billion   and a   $500 million   secured term loan agreement (the  Term Loan Agreement  and collectively with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the  Credit Agreements ). For lenders that extended their commitments ( extending lenders ), the Revolving Credit Agreement matures in July of 2019. For lenders that did not extend their commitments (such lenders, representing   $229 million  , the  non-extending lenders ), the Revolving Credit Agreement matures in July of 2017. The Term Loan Agreement matures on July of 2020, and beginning September 30, 2016, a principal repayment of   $12.5 million   is required on the last day of each quarter. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $989 million   available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Agreement and there were   $61 million   in outstanding letters of credit. 
    
  Loans under the Credit Agreements are subject to varying rates of interest based on whether the loan is a Eurodollar loan or an alternate base rate loan. We also incur a quarterly facility fee on the amount of the Revolving Credit Agreement. See   Note 9   Long-term Debt  , for information related to interest rate applicable for the Term Loan Agreement. 
    
  Eurodollar Loans.    Eurodollar loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate, which is LIBOR, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for Eurodollar loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement depends on whether the lender is an extending lender or a non-extending lender. For non-extending lenders, the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement ranges from   0.75%   to   1.925%   depending on our credit rating, and for extending lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement the applicable margin ranges from   1.925%   to   3.7%   depending on our leverage ratio.  
    
  Alternate Base Rate Loans.    Alternate base rate loans bear interest at the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for alternate base rate loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement depends on whether the lender is an extending lender or a non-extending lender.  For non-extending lenders, the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement ranges from   0.0%   to   0.925%   depending on our credit rating, and for extending lenders the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement ranges from   0.925%   to   2.7%   depending on our leverage ratio.  
    
  Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement may be repaid from time to time without penalty. Obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. In addition, obligations under the Credit Agreements are guaranteed by a material portion of our subsidiaries.

Our Credit Agreements contain covenants including, among others, the following: 
             
    a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions;   
                
    a restriction on creating liens on our assets and the assets of our operating subsidiaries, subject to permitted exceptions;   
                
    restrictions on mergers or asset dispositions;  
                
    restrictions on use of proceeds, investments, transactions with affiliates, or change of principal business; and 
                
    maintenance of the following financial covenants: 
              1) 
    leverage ratio of no greater than   3.0   to 1 through December 31, 2016 and   2.5   to 1 thereafter until maturity. This ratio measures our indebtedness guaranteed by subsidiaries under the Credit Agreements and other guaranteed facilities to the trailing four quarters consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other specified charges ( EBITDA   
              2) 
    leverage and letters of credit ratio of no greater than   4.0   to 1 on or before December 31, 2016 and   3.5   to 1 thereafter calculated as our indebtedness guaranteed by subsidiaries under the Credit Agreements and other guaranteed facilities and all letters of credit to the trailing four quarters consolidated adjusted EBITDA; and  
              3) 
    asset coverage ratio of at least   4.0   to 1, which is calculated as our asset value to indebtedness guaranteed by subsidiaries under the Credit Agreements and other guaranteed facilities. 
       
  Our Credit Agreements contain customary events of default, including our failure to comply with the financial covenants described above. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these financial covenants.  
    
  On July 19, 2016, we amended these facilities to make minor changes and amendments to certain collateral provisions,  negative covenants and related definitions, and to add an accordion feature to permit new and existing lenders to add up to a maximum of   $250 million   in additional commitments. 
    
  Other Short-Term Borrowings and Other Debt Activity 
    
  We have short-term borrowings with various domestic and international institutions pursuant to uncommitted credit facilities. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $43 million   in short-term borrowings under these arrangements, primarily from overdraft facility borrowings. In the nine months of 2016, we repaid   $180 million   borrowed under a credit agreement that matured in the first half of 2016. In addition, we had   $542 million   of letters of credit under various uncommitted facilities and   $148 million   of surety bonds, primarily performance bonds, issued by financial sureties against an indemnification from us at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the current portion of long-term debt was primarily related to our   6.35%   Senior Notes due 2017 and the current portion of our secured term loan and capital leases. Our   5.50%   senior notes with a principal balance of   $350 million   were repaid in February 2016.

9. Long-term Debt 
    
  Long-term Debt consisted of the following: 

Secured Term Loan Agreement 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, we borrowed   $500 million   under the Term Loan Agreement. The interest rate under the Term Loan Agreement is variable and is determined by our leverage ratio as of the most recent fiscal quarter, as either (1)   the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a variable margin rate   ranging from   1.425%   to   3.20%   or (2)   the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin   ranging from   0.425%   to   2.20%  . For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate for the Term Loan Agreement was LIBOR plus a margin rate of   1.425%   and the interest rate for the Revolving Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus a margin rate of   1.925%  . Beginning September 30, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement requires a principal repayment of   $12.5 million   on the last day of each quarter.  
    
  Exchangeable Senior Notes, Senior Notes and Tender Offers 
    
  We have issued various senior notes, all of which rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, which have semi-annual interest payments and no sinking fund requirements.   
    
  Exchangeable Senior Notes 
    
  On June 7, 2016, we issued exchangeable notes with a par value of   $1.265 billion   and an interest rate of   5.875%  .   The notes have a conversion price of   $7.74   per share and are exchangeable into a total of   163.4 million   shares of the Company upon the occurrence of certain events or on or after January 1, 2021. The notes mature on July 1, 2021. We have the choice to settle the exchange of the notes in any combination of cash or shares. As of   September 30, 2016  , the if-converted value did not exceed the principal amount of the notes.

Table of Contents  

The exchange feature is reported with a carrying amount of   $97 million   in    Capital in Excess of Par Value    on the   accompanying   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt component of the exchangeable notes has been reported separately in    Long-term Debt    on the   accompanying   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with a carrying value of   $1.142 billion   at   September 30, 2016   net of remaining unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of   $123 million  .  The discount on the debt component will be amortized over the remaining maturity of the exchangeable notes at an effective interest rate of   8.4%  . During the   third quarter   of   2016  , interest expense on the notes was   $30 million  , of which   $24 million   related to accrued interest and   $6 million   related to amortization of the discount.  
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  On June 17, 2016, we issued   $750 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.75%   senior notes due 2021 and   $750 million   in aggregate principal amount of   8.25%   senior notes due 2023. 
    
  Tender Offers and Early Retirement of Senior Notes 
    
  We commenced a cash tender offer on June 1, 2016 (and amended the offer on June 8, 2016 and June 10, 2016), which included an early tender option with an early settlement date of June 17, 2016 and an expiration date of June 30, 2016 with a final settlement date of July 1, 2016 to repurchase a portion of our   6.35%   senior notes due 2017,   6.00%   senior notes due 2018,   9.625%   senior notes due 2019, and   5.125%   senior notes due 2020. On June 17, 2016, we settled the early tender offers in cash in the amount of   $1.972 billion  , retiring an aggregate face value of senior notes tendered of   $1.869 billion   and accrued interest of   $27 million  . We recognized a cumulative loss of   $78 million   on these transactions in    Bond Tender Premium, Net    on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 30, 2016, we accepted additional tenders of   $2 million   of debt, which we settled in cash on July 1, 2016. 
    
  In the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of 2015, through a series of open market transactions, we repurchased certain of our   4.50%   senior notes,   5.95%   senior notes,   6.50%   senior notes,   6.75%   senior notes and   7.00%    with a total book value of   $236 million   and   $396 million  , respectively. We recognized a cumulative gain of approximately   $35 million   and   $47 million  , respectively, on these transactions in  Other, Net  on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

10.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Assets and Equity Investments 
    
  Financial Instruments Measured and Recognized at Fair Value 
    
  We estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability. Our valuation techniques require inputs that we categorize using a three level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices or other market data for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based upon our own judgment and assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. Classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Other than the derivative instruments discussed in    Note 11   Derivative Instruments  ,  we had no other material assets or liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
    
  Our other financial instruments include short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The carrying value of our short-term borrowings approximates their fair value due to the short-term duration of the associated interest rate periods. These short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The fair value of our long-term debt fluctuates with changes in applicable interest rates among other factors. Fair value will generally exceed carrying value when the current market interest rate is lower than the interest rate at which the debt was originally issued and will generally be less than the carrying value when the market rate is greater than interest rate at which the debt was originally issued. The fair value of our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy and is established based on observable inputs in less active markets.

The fair value and carrying value of our senior notes were as follows:  

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, long-lived assets were impaired and written down to their estimated fair values. The Level 3 fair values of the long-lived assets were determined using either an income approach or a market approach. The unobservable inputs to the income approach included the assets  estimated future cash flows and estimates of discount rates commensurate with the assets  risks.  The market approach considered unobservable estimates of market sales values, which in most cases was a scrap of salvage value estimate.   
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, long-lived pressure pumping assets and an equity investment were impaired and written down to their estimated fair values. The Level 3 fair values of the long-lived assets were determined using a combination of the cost approach and the market approach, which used inputs that included replacement costs (unobservable), physical deterioration estimates (unobservable), and market sales data for comparable assets. The equity investment Level 3 fair value was determined using an income based approach utilizing estimates of future cash flow, discount rate, long-term growth rate, and marketability discount, all of which were unobservable. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we adjusted the note from PDVSA to its estimated fair value. The Level 3 fair value was estimated based on unobservable pricing indications. 

11.  Derivative Instruments 
    
  From time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce our market risk. We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates, and we may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in various foreign currencies. The major risks from derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates, changes in foreign exchange rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.  
    
  We monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are multinational commercial banks. The fair values of all our outstanding derivative instruments are determined using a model with Level 2 inputs including quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates.  
    
  Fair Value Hedges 
    
  We may use interest rate swaps to help mitigate exposures related to changes in the fair values of fixed-rate debt. The interest rate swap is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The carrying value of fixed-rate debt is also adjusted for changes in interest rates, with the changes in value recorded in earnings. After termination of the hedge, any discount or premium on the fixed-rate debt is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any fair value hedge designated. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had net unamortized premiums on fixed-rate debt of   $8 million   associated with fair value hedge terminations. These premiums are being amortized over the remaining term of the originally hedged debt as a reduction in interest expense included in  Interest Expense, Net  on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  In 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative instruments to hedge projected exposures to interest rates in anticipation of a debt offering. These hedges were terminated at the time of the issuance of the debt, and the associated loss is being amortized from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. As of   September 30,

Table of Contents  

2016  , we had net unamortized losses of   $9 million   associated with our cash flow hedge terminations. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any cash flow hedges designated. 
    
  Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating to   $1.6 billion   and   $1.7 billion  , respectively. The notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties and thus are not a measure of the cash requirements related to these contracts or of any possible loss exposure. The amounts actually exchanged at maturity are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivative contracts, such as exchange rates.  
    
  Our foreign currency derivatives are not designated as hedges under ASC 815, and the changes in fair value of the contracts are recorded each period in  Other, Net  on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total estimated fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were as follows:

12.  Income Taxes 
    
  We estimate our annual effective tax rate based on year-to-date operating results and our forecast for the remainder of the year, by jurisdiction, and apply this rate to the year-to-date operating results. If our actual results, by jurisdiction, differ from the forecasted operating results, our effective tax rate can change, affecting the tax expense for both successive interim results as well as the annual tax results. For the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016  , we had a tax expense of   $692 million   and   $489 million  , respectively, on a loss before income taxes of   $1.1 billion   and   $2.3 billion  , respectively. The primary component of the tax expense for the third quarter and nine months of 2016 relates to the Company s conclusion that certain deferred tax assets that had previously been benefited are not more likely than not to be realized.  As a result, additional valuation allowances have been established for the United States and other jurisdictions. 
    
  Weatherford records deferred tax assets for net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities that are expected to produce tax deductions in future periods. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets would be deductible.  The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) when determining whether a valuation allowance is required. The Company evaluated possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets, including projected future taxable income, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The realizability of the deferred tax assets are dependent upon judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operation conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil prices and market demand for our products and services). 
    
  Operations in the United States and other jurisdictions continue to experience losses due to the prolonged downturn in the demand for oil field services. Additionally, our expectations regarding the recovery in the second half of 2016 and into 2017 are more measured due to the difficulties in obtaining pricing increases from our customers and a slower recovery in the U.S. land market.  Also, the Company recorded significant long-lived asset impairments and established allowances for inventory and other assets in the third quarter.  As a result of the historical and projected future losses, and limited objective positive evidence to overcome negative evidence, the Company concluded that it needed to record a valuation allowance of   $526 million   as of   September 30, 2016   against certain previously benefited deferred tax assets since it cannot support that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation allowance primarily relates to operations in the United States. 
    
  The Company will continue to evaluate whether valuation allowances are needed in future reporting periods. Valuation allowances will remain until the Company can determine that net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.  In the event that the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future as a result of significant improvement in earnings as a result of market conditions, the Company would adjust the valuation allowance, reducing the provision for income taxes in the period of such adjustment. 
    
  Results for the   third quarter   of   2016   also include charges with no significant tax benefit principally related to   $436 million   of long-lived asset impairments,   $198 million   of excess and obsolete inventory charges,   $62 million   in accounts receivable reserves and write-offs, and   $44 million   of other asset write-offs and charges.  In addition, we recorded a tax charge of   $137 million   for a non-cash tax expense related to an internal restructuring of subsidiaries. 
    
  Results for the   nine   months of   2016   also include charges with no significant tax benefit principally related to   $436 million   of long-lived asset impairments,   $213 million   of excess and obsolete inventory charges,   $140 million   of settlement agreement charges,   $31 million   of currency devaluation related to the Angolan kwanza,   $78 million   of bond tender premium, and   $84 million   of PDVSA note receivable adjustment,   $62 million   in accounts receivable reserves and write-offs,   $20 million   in pressure pumping business related charges, and   $15 million   in supply agreement charges related to a non-core business divestiture.  In addition, we recorded a tax charge of   $526 million   for the establishment of a valuation allowance discussed previously, and   $137 million   for a non-cash tax expense related to an internal restructuring of subsidiaries. 
    
  We are continuously under tax examination in various jurisdictions. We cannot predict the timing or outcome regarding resolution of these tax examinations or if they will have a material impact on our financial statements. We continue to anticipate a possible reduction in the balance of uncertain tax positions of approximately   $42 million   in the next twelve months due to expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or conclusions of tax examinations.

For the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , we had a   $65 million   and   $197 million   tax benefit, respectively, on a loss before income taxes of   $226 million   and   $948 million  , respectively. Our results for the   third quarter   of   2015   includes   $49 million   of restructuring charges,   $44 million   of project losses and   $26 million   of currency devaluation and related losses related to the Angolan kwanza and Kazakhstani tenge, with no significant tax benefit. Our results for the   nine   months of   2015   includes   $159 million   of restructuring charges,   $112 million   of litigation settlements,   $71 million   of project losses,   $68 million   of currency devaluation and related losses and   $20 million   of equity investment impairment, with no significant tax benefit.

14.  Earnings per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share for all periods presented equals net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of our shares outstanding during the period including participating securities. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of our shares outstanding during the period including participating securities, adjusted for the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted shares and performance units. The following table presents our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  : 

Our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the periods presented are equivalent due to the net loss attributable to shareholders. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   exclude potential shares for stock options, restricted shares, performance units and exchangeable notes outstanding as we have net losses for those periods, and their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The following table presents the number of anti-dilutive shares excluded for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  :

15.  Share-Based Compensation 
    
  We recognized the following employee share-based compensation expense during the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  : 

During the   nine   months of   2016  , we granted approximately   2.1 million   performance units to certain employees, which will vest with continued employment if the Company meets certain market-based performance goals. The performance units have a weighted average grant date fair value of   $5.11   per share based on the Monte Carlo simulation method. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation included a risk-free rate of   0.80%  , volatility of   68%   and a   zero   dividend yield. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $13 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to our performance units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2   years. 
    
  During the   nine   months of   2016  , we also granted   7.7 million   restricted shares at a weighted average grant date fair value of   $6.27   per share. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $104 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to our unvested restricted share grants. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2   years.

17.  Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies  
    
  Shareholder Litigation 
    
  In 2010,   three   shareholder derivative actions were filed, purportedly on behalf of the Company, asserting breach of duty and other claims against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company related to the United Nations oil-for-food program governing sales of goods into Iraq, the FCPA and trade sanctions related to the U.S. government investigations disclosed in our U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) filings since 2007. Those shareholder derivative cases were filed in Harris County, Texas state court and consolidated under the caption   Neff v. Brady, et al.  , No. 2010040764 (collectively referred to as the    Neff   Case ). Other shareholder demand letters covering the same subject matter were received by the Company in early 2014, and a fourth shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of the Company, also asserting breach of duty and other claims against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company related to the same subject matter as the   Neff   Case. That case, captioned   Erste-Sparinvest KAG v. Duroc-Danner, et al.,   No. 201420933 (Harris County, Texas) was consolidated into the   Neff   Case in September 2014. A motion to dismiss was granted May 15, 2015 and an appeal, which remains pending, was filed on June 15, 2015. 
    
  We cannot reliably predict the outcome of the appeal including the amount of any possible loss. If one or more negative outcomes were to occur relative to the   Neff   Case, the aggregate impact to our financial condition could be material. 
    
  On June 30, 2015, we signed a stipulation to settle a shareholder securities class action captioned   Freedman v. Weatherford International Ltd., et al.  , No. 1:12-cv-02121-LAK (S.D.N.Y.) for   $120 million   subject to notice to the class and court approval. The   Freedman   lawsuit had been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in March 2012 and alleged that we and certain current and former officers of Weatherford violated the federal securities laws in connection with the restatements of the Company s historical financial statements announced on February 21, 2012 and July 24, 2012. On November 4, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment and an order approving the settlement of the shareholder securities class action captioned   Freedman v. Weatherford International Ltd., et al.  , No. 1:12-cv-02121-LAK (S.D.N.Y.). Pursuant to the settlement, we were required to pay   $120 million   in 2015, which was partially funded by insurance proceeds. There was no admission of liability or fault by any party in connection with the settlement. We are pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers and have recovered a total of   $19 million   of the settlement amount, of which   $4 million   have been recovered in 2016.

U.S. Government and Other Investigations 
    
  As previously disclosed, the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) were investigating certain accounting issues associated with the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for income taxes that was disclosed in a notification of late filing on Form 12b-25 filed on March 1, 2011 and in current reports on Form 8-K filed on February 21, 2012 and on July 24, 2012 and the subsequent restatements of our historical financial statements. During the first quarter 2016, we recorded a loss contingency in the amount of   $65 million  . In the second quarter 2016, we increased our loss contingency to   $140 million   reflecting our best estimate for the potential settlement of this matter which ultimately became the final settlement on September 27, 2016. As previously disclosed on Form 8-K filed on September 27, 2016, the Company settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the findings of the SEC, by consenting to the entry of an administrative order that requires the Company to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules promulgated thereunder. As part of the terms of the SEC Settlement, the Company has also agreed to pay a total civil monetary penalty of   $140 million  , with   $50 million   due within   21   days from the settlement agreement and   three   installments of   $30 million   due within   120  ,   240   and   360   days and prepare and deliver certain reports and certifications to the SEC for the next   two   years regarding our tax internal controls. 
    
  Additionally, we are aware of various disputes and potential claims and are a party in various litigation involving claims against us, including as a defendant in various employment claims alleging our failure to pay certain classes of workers overtime in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act for which an agreement was reached during the second quarter 2016. Some of these disputes and claims are covered by insurance. For claims, disputes and pending litigation in which we believe a negative outcome is probable and a loss can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded a liability for the expected loss. These liabilities are immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations.  
    
  In addition we have certain claims, disputes and pending litigation for which we do not believe a negative outcome is probable or for which we can only estimate a range of liability. It is possible, however, that an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us, or we could decide to resolve a case or cases, that would result in liability that could be uninsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved and in some cases those losses could be material. If one or more negative outcomes were to occur relative to these matters, the aggregate impact to our financial condition could be material. 
    
  Other Contingencies 
    
  We have a contractual residual value guarantee at September 30, 2016 of   $28 million   in    Other Non-Current Liabilities    on   the   accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets related to certain leased equipment in our North America pressure pumping business.  
    
  We have supply contract related minimum purchase commitments and maintain a liability at September 30, 2016 of   $133 million   for expected penalties to be paid, of which   $27 million   is recorded in    Other Current Liabilities    and   $106 million   is recorded in    Other Non-Current Liabilities    on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

18.  New Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  Accounting Changes 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. We adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 retrospectively, which reduced Long-term debt and Other non-current assets by   $27 million   as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  , which eliminates a current exception in U.S. GAAP to the recognition of the income tax effects of temporary differences that result from intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The intra-entity exception is being eliminated under the ASU. The standard is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis and will be effective beginning with the first quarter of 2018.  Early adoption is permitted, and we are evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.      
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the cash flow reporting of certain issues that were either unclear or not addressed under existing U.S. GAAP.  The standard requires the retrospective transition method to each period presented and will be effective beginning with the first quarter of 2018, although early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that ASC 2016-15 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.      
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13  , Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new standard applies to trade receivables and requires expected credit losses to be based on past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the instrument s collectability. The new standard will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption is permitted in 2019. We are evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which impacts certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This update provides various transition requirements that include both prospective, modified retrospective and retrospective application guidance. The new standard will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but it must include all amendments in the same period. We are evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires a lessee to recognize a lease asset and lease liability for most leases, including those classified as operating leases under existing GAAP.  The ASU also changes the definition of a lease and requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures for both lessees and lessors. The new standard will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019. Early application is permitted. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition method and permits certain practical expedients to be applied. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17  , Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, all deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be classified as noncurrent. The new standard will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which requires inventory not measured using either the last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The new standard will be effective for us beginning with the first  
  
   24 

Table of Contents  

quarter of 2017, and will be applied prospectively.  Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the impact of our adoption to have a material effect on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which will require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual and interim reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 permits either a retrospective application or a cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected the application date or a transition method, and we are currently evaluating the impact our adoption of this standard would have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  As used herein, the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Weatherford International plc ( Weatherford Ireland ), a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland, and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes   thereto included in    Item 1. Financial Statements.     Our discussion includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and services and our future results. These statements are based on certain assumptions we consider reasonable. For information about these assumptions, please review the section entitled  Forward-Looking Statements  and the section entitled    Part II   Other Information     Item 1A.   Risk Factors  .  

Overview 
    
  General 
    
  We conduct operations globally and have service and sales locations in nearly all of the oil and natural gas producing regions in the world. Our operational performance is reviewed on a geographic basis, and we report these regions as separate, distinct reporting segments. 
    
  Our principal business is to provide equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, both on land and offshore, through our three business groups: (1) Formation Evaluation and Well Construction, (2) Completion and Production and (3) Land Drilling Rigs, which together include 14 product lines. 

Formation Evaluation and Well Construction   includes Managed-Pressure Drilling, Drilling Services, Tubular Running Services, Drilling Tools, Wireline Services, Testing and Production Services, Re-entry and Fishing Services, Cementing, Liner Systems, Integrated Laboratory Services and Surface Logging Systems. 
                
    Completion and Production   includes Artificial Lift Systems, Stimulation and Completion Systems. 
                
    Land Drilling Rigs   encompasses our land drilling rigs business, including the products and services ancillary thereto. 
       
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation related to adoption of new accounting standards. Net income and shareholders  equity were not affected by these reclassifications. See    Note 18   New Accounting Pronouncements    to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 

Industry Trends 
    
  The level of spending in the energy industry is heavily influenced by current and expected future prices of oil and natural gas. Changes in expenditures result in an increased or decreased demand for our products and services. Rig count is an indicator of the level of spending for exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves. The following chart sets forth certain statistics that reflect historical market conditions:  

(a) 
    Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil as of the date indicated at Cushing, Oklahoma   Source: Thomson Reuters 
              (b) 
    Price per MM/BTU as of the date indicated at Henry Hub Louisiana   Source: Thomson Reuters 
              (c) 
    Quarterly average rig count   Source: Baker Hughes Rig Count 
       
  During   2016   oil prices ranged from a high of $51.23 per barrel in early June to a low of less than of $27.00 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Natural gas ranged from a high of $3.13 MM/BTU in mid-September to a low of $1.64 MM/BTU in early March. Factors influencing oil and natural gas prices during the period include hydrocarbon inventory levels, realized and expected global economic growth, realized and expected levels of hydrocarbon demand, level of production capacity and weather and geopolitical uncertainty.

Outlook  
    
  The nine months of 2016 have been challenged by the continued weakness in oil prices and severe market contraction for our services, but we believe the bottom of the down cycle has been reached during the third quarter and that the industry is at the beginning of a modest recovery. The market weakness and contraction has materially reduced capital spending by our customers, which has reduced our revenue, both through lower activity levels and pricing. In response to the weakness in the price of crude oil and the decline in the anticipated level of exploration and production spending in 2016, we previously announced a workforce reduction of 8,000 and have completed this plan as of September 30, 2016. We continue to meet our target to close nine manufacturing and service facilities during 2016 as seven closures were completed by the end of the third quarter 2016. We now project to close over 70 of our operating and non-operating facilities in 2016 and have completed over 50 of those closures through the end of the third quarter. 
    
  We expect the weak market conditions to continue recovering on land and to be concentrated in North America, MENA and Russia during the remainder of 2016 and throughout 2017. We continue to expect pricing to stabilize in the remainder of 2016 with no further large pricing concessions and potentially the beginning of some small increases in select markets. North America land activity has begun to increase slowly, primarily in the Permian, and continued growth will initially be driven by Pressure Pumping, Artificial Lift and Completion. Internationally, we expect Latin America to continue to have modest growth through the remainder of 2016, reasonable growth in Europe/SSA/Russia from increases in market share and activity primarily from Russia and the North Sea, and activity increases in MENA/Asia Pacific from increased activity and market share from recent contract wins primarily in the Gulf States. Over the longer term, we believe the outlook for our core businesses is favorable. As decline rates accelerate for well production and reservoir productivity complexities increase, our clients will continue to face challenges associated with decreasing the cost of extraction activities and securing desired rates of production. These challenges increase our customers  requirements for technologies that improve productivity and efficiency and therefore increase demand for our products and services. These factors provide us with a positive outlook for our core businesses over the longer term. However, the level of improvement in our core businesses in the future will depend heavily on pricing, volume of work and our ability to offer solutions to more efficiently extract hydrocarbons, control costs and penetrate new and existing markets with our newly developed technologies. 
    
  We continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or dispositions of assets, businesses, investments or joint ventures. We evaluate our disposition candidates based on the strategic fit within our business and/or objectives. It is also our intention to divest our remaining land drilling rigs when market conditions improve. Upon completion, the cash proceeds from any divestitures are expected to be used to repay or repurchase debt. Any such debt reduction may include the repurchase of our outstanding senior notes prior to their maturity in the open market similar to the transactions from the second quarter 2016, or through a privately negotiated transaction or otherwise. 
    
  The oilfield services industry growth is highly dependent on many external factors, such as our customers  capital expenditures, world economic and political conditions, the price of oil and natural gas, member-country quota compliance within th Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and weather conditions and other factors, including those described in the section entitled  Forward-Looking Statements.  
    
  Opportunities and Challenges 
    
  Our industry offers many opportunities and challenges. The cyclicality of the energy industry impacts the demand for our products and services. Certain of our products and services, such as our drilling and evaluation services, well installation services and well completion services, depend on the level of exploration and development activity and the completion phase of the well life cycle. Other products and services, such as our production optimization and artificial lift systems, are dependent on production activity. We have created a long-term strategy aimed at growing our businesses, servicing our customers, and most importantly, creating value for our shareholders. The success of our long-term strategy will be determined by our ability to manage effectively any industry cyclicality, including the ongoing and prolonged industry downturn and our ability to respond to industry demands and periods of over-supply or low oil prices, successfully maximize the benefits from our acquisitions and complete the disposition of our land drilling rigs business.

Revenue Percentage by Product Service Line Group 
    
  The following chart contains the percentage distribution of our consolidated revenues by product service line group for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  : 

Consolidated Revenues 
    
  Consolidated revenues   decreased     $881 million  , or   39%  , and   $3.1 billion  , or   41%  , in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. Revenues decreased in the   third quarter   and the nine months of   2016   compared to 2015 across all of our segments as follows: 

North America revenues declined   $375 million  , or   46%  , in the third quarter and   $1.40 billion  , or   50%  , for the nine months consistent with the   43%     decrease   in North American rig count since the   third   quarter of   2015   with significant declines across product lines in the United States and Canada, particularly pressure pumping, artificial lift, intervention services and drilling services. The decline in the North America segment was driven by a combination of lower activity and continued customer pricing pressure; 
                
    International segment revenues declined   $418 million  , or   34%  , in the third quarter and   $1.44 billion  , or   35%  , for the nine months due to the   17%     decrease   in international rig count since the end of the   third   quarter of   2015   as well as declines in revenue from our Europe/Russia/SSA and Latin America segments due to pricing pressure and reduced activity from lower customer spending across our product lines. The MENA/Asia Pacific segment revenues declined due to decrease in customer activity, partly offset by an improvement from the recognition of revenue as part of the settlement agreement signed in the second quarter for the Zubair percentage-of-completion project in Iraq; and 
                
    Land Drilling Rigs revenue declines of   $88 million  , or   47%  , in the third quarter and   $240 million  , or   42%  , for the nine months primarily attributable to the decline in drilling activity consistent with the rig count declines.   
       
  Operating Loss 
    
  Consolidated operating loss increased   $847 million  , or   864%  , and increased   $1.34 billion  , or   262%  , in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The higher operating loss in the   third quarter   and continued decline for the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   nine   months of   2015   was due to low customer activity levels and pricing pressures from the low price of crude oil. The decline was partially offset by income recognized from the settlement of our Zubair percentage-of-completion project and reduced corporate expenses and research and development from our cost reduction measures. 
     
  Consolidated operating loss for the   third quarter   of   2016   and consolidated operating loss for the   third quarter   of   2015   also includes charges of   $771 million   and   $77 million  , respectively. The charges in each quarter are as follows:  

$740 million   in   2016   of charges comprised of long-lived asset impairments of   $436 million  , inventory charges of   $198 million  , account receivables reserves and write-offs of   $62 million   and   $44 million   of other asset write-offs and charges compared to   $17 million   in   2015   primarily related to the supply contract and asset base impairments of our U.S. pressure pumping business;  
                 
    $9 million   in   2016   primarily for the increase in litigation reserves; and 
                
    $11 million   in   2015   of charges related to professional and other fees, divestiture related charges, facility closure fees and other charges.

Table of Contents  

Consolidated operating loss for the   nine   months of   2016   and consolidated operating loss for the   nine   months of   2015   also primarily includes charges of   $1.29 billion   and   $529 million  , respectively. The charges in each   nine   month period are as follows: 

$951 million   in   2016   of charges comprised of long-lived asset impairments of   $436 million  , inventory charges of   $213 million  , a fair value adjustment to   a note receivable   of   $84 million  , account receivables reserves and write-offs of   $62 million   and other asset write-offs and pressure pumping business related charges of   $156 million   compared to    $208 million   in 2015 primarily related to fixed asset impairments, U.S. pressure pumping business and supply contract related charges;  
                
    $190 million   in   2016   primarily for the increase in litigation reserves in the settlement of a restatement related litigation pertaining to prior periods with the SEC/DOJ compared to   $112 million   in   2015   of litigation charges related to U.S. government investigations and other restatement related litigation; 
                 
    $20 million   in   2015   related to the impairment of an equity method investment; and 
                
    $30 million   in   2015   of professional and other fees, divestiture related charges, facility closure fees and other charges. 
     For additional information regarding charges by segment, see the subsection entitled  Segment Results  and  Restructuring Charges  below.  

Segment Results 
    
  North America 
    
  Revenues in our North America segment   decreased     $375 million  , or   46%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $1.4 billion  , or   50%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. North American average rig count has decreased   43%   since the third quarter of 2015. The decline in revenue in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   was due to lower activity and pricing pressure that broadly impacted all product lines, particularly artificial lift, well construction, pressure pumping, intervention services and drilling tools, drilling services, secure drilling services and completions. 
    
  Operating loss in our North America segment   increased     $41 million  , or   76%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $168 million  , or   108%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. Operating loss in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   compared to 2015 is due to lower activity and pricing pressure impacting the profitability of artificial lift, intervention services and drilling tools, and completions, partially offset by cost savings from operating and non-operating facility closures, headcount reductions, lower depreciation and amortization due to decreased capital spending and impairments. These strong cost reduction measures helped minimize the operating losses despite the large revenue declines. 

MENA/Asia Pacific 
    
  Revenues in our MENA/Asia Pacific segment   decreased     $116 million  , or   26%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $404 million  , or   27%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The revenue decline affected most product lines, primarily completion, tubular running services and intervention services, drilling tools as well as pressure pumping. The decline was attributable to lower revenues in Saudi Arabia and Iraq and lower activity in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in Australia, China and Malaysia.  
    
  Operating loss of   $8 million   in the   third quarter   of 2016 worsened   $10 million   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . The increase in operating loss is primarily attributable to the continued weakness in activity and pricing. Operating income   decreased     $49 million   to an operating loss of   $4 million  , or   109%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to lower activity across most product lines, partially offset by the profit recognition from the Zubair contract settlement.

Europe/SSA/Russia 
    
  Revenues in our Europe/SSA/Russia segment   decreased     $136 million  , or   38%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $471 million  , or   39%   during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The decline in customer activity and overall lower demand impacted all product lines and was concentrated in the Europe and SSA regions, and primarily in the United Kingdom and Angola. Russia was negatively impacted by lower activity and a minimal seasonal recovery compared to the prior year. 
    
  Operating income   decreased     $46 million  , or   107%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $182 million  , or   102%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The factors contributing to the revenue decline directly impacted the operating income decline. 

Latin America 
    
  Revenues in our Latin America segment   decreased     $166 million  , or   39%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $561 million  , or   41%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The decline in revenue is primarily due to customer pricing adjustments and budget spending reductions by our customers as well as reduced demand broadly impacting all product lines. 
    
  Operating income   decreased     $59 million  , or   81%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $188 million  , or   76%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The decline in operating income is primarily due to customer pricing adjustments as well as reduced demand broadly impacting all product lines. 

Land Drilling Rigs 
    
  Revenues in our   Land Drilling Rigs   segment   decreased     $88 million  , or   47%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $240 million  , or   42%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively.  Operating income   decreased     $35 million  , or   219%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $92 million  , or   307%  , during the   nine   months of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   and   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The decreases are primarily from lower rig utilization and delays due to rig maintenance, pricing pressures, and reduced drilling activity which negatively impacted our operations primarily in MENA. 

Currency Devaluation Charges 
    
  The currency devaluation charges are included in current earnings in    Currency Devaluation Charges    on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.   In the nine months of 2016, currency devaluation charges reflect the impact of the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza of   $31 million  . In the   third quarter   of   2015  , currency devaluation charges of   $26 million   reflect the impact of the   $20 million   devaluation of the Angolan kwanza and   $6 million   related to the depreciated Kazakhstani tenge. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , currency devaluation charges of   $68 million   reflect the impacts of the   $36 million   devaluation of the Angolan kwanza, the recognized remeasurement charges of   $26 million   related to the Venezuelan bolivar and   $6 million   related to the depreciated Kazakhstani tenge.  
    
  Included in  Other, Net  on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are other net foreign currency losses of   $6 million   and   $4 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, compared to losses of   $16 million   and   $42 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. Net foreign currency gains and losses are primarily due to either the strengthening or weakening U.S. dollar compared to our foreign denominated operations and the changes in fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts. 

Interest Expense, Net 
    
  Net interest expense was   $129 million   and   $363 million   for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, compared to   $114 million   and   $351 million   for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , respectively. The changes in interest expense for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   were primarily from the amounts accrued related to the new notes issued in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by repayments and the repurchase of debt earlier in the year and from the second quarter 2016 bond tender offering. 

Income Taxes  

40 

Table of Contents  

We estimate our annual effective tax rate based on year-to-date operating results and our forecast for the remainder of the year, by jurisdiction, and apply this rate to the year-to-date operating results. If our actual results, by jurisdiction, differ from the forecasted operating results, our effective tax rate can change, affecting the tax expense for both successive interim results as well as the annual tax results. For the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016  , we had a tax expense of   $692 million   and   $489 million  , respectively, on a loss before income taxes of   $1.1 billion   and   $2.3 billion  , respectively. The primary component of the tax expense for the third quarter and nine months of 2016 relates to the Company s conclusion that certain deferred tax assets that had previously been benefited are not more likely than not to be realized.  As a result, additional valuation allowances have been established for the United States and other jurisdictions. 
    
  Weatherford records deferred tax assets for net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities that are expected to produce tax deductions in future periods. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets would be deductible.  The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) when determining whether a valuation allowance is required. The Company evaluated possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets, including projected future taxable income, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The realizability of the deferred tax assets are dependent upon judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operation conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil prices and market demand for our products and services). 
    
  Operations in the United States and other jurisdictions continue to experience losses due to the prolonged downturn in the demand for oil field services. Additionally, our expectations regarding the recovery in the second half of 2016 and into 2017 are more measured due to the difficulties in obtaining pricing increases from our customers and a slower recovery in the U.S. land market.  Also, the Company recorded significant long-lived asset impairments and established allowances for inventory and other assets in the third quarter.  As a result of the historical and projected future losses, and limited objective positive evidence to overcome negative evidence, the Company concluded that it needed to record a valuation allowance of   $526 million   as of September 30, 2016 against certain previously benefited deferred tax assets since it cannot support that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation allowance primarily relates to operations in the United States. 
    
  The Company will continue to evaluate whether valuation allowances are needed in future reporting periods. Valuation allowances will remain until the Company can determine that net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.  In the event that the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future as a result of significant improvement in earnings as a result of market conditions, the Company would adjust the valuation allowance, reducing the provision for income taxes in the period of such adjustment. 
    
  Results for the   third quarter   of   2016   also include charges with no significant tax benefit principally related to   $436 million   of long-lived asset impairments,   $198 million   of excess and obsolete inventory charges,   $62 million   in accounts receivable reserves and write-offs, and   $44 million   of other asset write-offs and charges.  In addition, we recorded a tax charge of   $137 million   for a non-cash tax expense related to an internal restructuring of subsidiaries. 
    
  Results for the   nine   months of   2016   also include charges with no significant tax benefit principally related to   $436 million   of long-lived asset impairments,   $213 million   of excess and obsolete inventory charges,   $140 million   of settlement agreement charges,   $31 million   of currency devaluation related to the Angolan kwanza,   $78 million   of bond tender premium, and   $84 million   of PDVSA note receivable adjustment,   $62 million   in accounts receivable reserves and write-offs,   $20 million   in pressure pumping business related charges, and   $15 million   in supply agreement charges related to a non-core business divestiture.  In addition, we recorded a tax charge of   $526 million   for the establishment of a valuation allowance discussed previously, and   $137 million   for a non-cash tax expense related to an internal restructuring of subsidiaries. 
    
  We are continuously under tax examination in various jurisdictions. We cannot predict the timing or outcome regarding resolution of these tax examinations or if they will have a material impact on our financial statements. We continue to anticipate a possible reduction in the balance of uncertain tax positions of approximately   $42 million   in the next twelve months due to expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or conclusions of tax examinations.

For the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , we had a   $65 million   and   $197 million   tax benefit, respectively, on a loss before income taxes of   $226 million   and   $948 million  , respectively. Our results for the   third quarter   of   2015   includes   $49 million   of restructuring charges,   $44 million   of project losses and   $26 million   of currency devaluation and related losses related to the Angolan kwanza and Kazakhstani tenge, with no significant tax benefit. Our results for the   nine   months of   2015   includes   $159 million   of restructuring charges,   $112 million   of litigation settlements,   $71 million   of project losses,   $68 million   of currency devaluation and related losses and   $20 million   of equity investment impairment, with no significant tax benefit. 

Restructuring Charges 
    
  In response to continuing fluctuation of crude oil prices and our anticipation of a lower level of exploration and production spending in 2016, we initiated an additional plan to reduce our overall costs and workforce to better align with anticipated activity levels. This cost reduction plan (the    2016 Plan   ) included a workforce reduction and other cost reduction measures initiated across our geographic regions.  
    
  In connection with the   2016 Plan  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $22 million   and   $150 million   in the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, which include termination (severance) benefits of   $18 million   and   $126 million  , respectively, and other restructuring charges of   $4 million   and   $24 million  , respectively. Other restructuring charges include contract termination costs, relocation and other associated costs.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced a cost reduction plan (the    2015 Plan   ), which included a worldwide workforce reduction and other cost reduction measures. In the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized restructuring charges of   $49 million   and   $159 million   for the   2015 Plan  , which include termination (severance) benefits of   $40 million   and   $99 million  , respectively, and other restructuring charges of   $9 million   and   $60 million  , respectively. 
    
  The following tables present the components of the   2016 Plan   and the   2015 Plan   restructuring charges by segment for the   third quarter   and the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $440 million   compared to   $467 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The following table summarizes cash flows   provided by (used in)   each type of activity for the nine months of   2016   and   2015  : 

Operating Activities 
    
  For the   nine   months of   2016  , cash   used in   operating activities was   $450 million   compared to cash provided by operating activities of   $383 million   in the   nine   months of   2015  . The decline in operating cash flow in   2016   compared to   2015   was attributable to a decline in operating income due to the significant decline in oil prices and drilling activity, partially offset by cash flow from working capital. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  The primary driver of our investing cash flow activities is capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Capital expenditures were   $136 million   and   $542 million   for the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The amount we spend for capital expenditures varies each year based on the type of contracts into which we enter, our asset availability and our expectations with respect to industry activity levels in the following year. The significant decline in capital expenditures is due to the continued price fluctuation of crude oil, continued weakness in demand, and lower than expected exploration and production spending. 
    
  In the   nine   months of   2016  , we received   $39 million   of insurance proceeds from the casualty loss of a rig in Kuwait. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid   $20 million   for final working capital adjustment payments related to the sale of our engineered chemistry and Integrity drilling fluids businesses. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  For the   nine   months of   2016  , we received net proceeds of   $623 million   from the issuance of   115 million   ordinary shares of the Company. Our financing activities also consisted of the borrowing and repayment of short-term and long-term debt.  
    
  For the   nine   months of 2016, through a series of offerings, we received proceeds, net of underwriting fees, of   $3.2 billion   from the issuance of our   $1.265 billion  ,   5.875%   exchangeable senior notes,   $750 million  ,   7.75%   senior notes,   $750 million  ,   8.25%   senior notes and   $500 million   secured term loan. 
    
  We used the majority of the proceeds to fund tender offers to buy back our   6.35%   senior notes,   6.00%   senior notes,   9.625%   senior notes and   5.125%   senior notes with a principal balance of   $1.87 billion   and used the remaining proceeds to repay our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. We recognized a cumulative loss of   $78 million   on the tender offers buyback transaction. Financing activities for the   nine   months of 2016 also included the payment of   $87 million   of borrowings related to previously leased rig equipment.  Total long-term debt buybacks and repayments were   $368 million   for the   nine   months of   2015  .  
    
  Short-term debt repayments were   $1.1 billion   in the   nine   months of   2016   compared to short-term borrowings of   $606 million   in the   nine   months of   2015  . The short-term debt repayments in the   nine   months of   2016   were primarily for the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility and repayment of our   5.50%   senior notes with a principal balance of   $350 million  . 
    
  In the   nine   months of   2015  ,  total net long-term debt buybacks and repayments were   $368 million   which include the repurchase of certain of our   4.50%   senior notes,   5.95%   senior notes,   6.50%   senior notes and   6.75%   senior notes with a total book value of   $396 million  . We recognized a cumulative gain of   $35 million   in the third quarter and    $47 million   for the nine months of 2015 on these debt repurchase transactions.

Sources of Liquidity  
    
  Our sources of available liquidity include cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, accounts receivable factoring, dispositions, and availability under committed lines of credit. We also historically have accessed banks for short-term loans from uncommitted borrowing arrangements and have accessed the capital markets with debt and equity offerings. From time to time we may and have entered into transactions to dispose of businesses or capital assets that are no longer core to our long-term strategy. 
    
  Revolving Credit Facility and Secured Term Loan Agreement 
    
  We have a revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Agreement ) and a secured term loan agreement (the  Term Loan Agreement  and collectively with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the  Credit Agreements ). On July 19, 2016, we amended these facilities to make minor changes and amendments to certain collateral provisions, negative covenants and related definitions, and added an accordion feature to permit new and existing lenders to add up to a maximum of   $250 million   in additional commitments. Our Credit Agreements contain customary events of default, including our failure to comply with the financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our financial covenants as defined in the credit and indenture agreements.  
    
  The following summarizes our borrowing availability under the Credit Agreements at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions):

Other Short-Term Borrowings and Other Debt Activity 
    
  We have short-term borrowings with various domestic and international institutions pursuant to uncommitted credit facilities. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $43 million   in short-term borrowings under these arrangements, primarily from overdraft facility borrowings. In the nine months of 2016, we repaid   $180 million   borrowed under a credit agreement that matured in the first half of 2016.  
    
  Accounts Receivable Factoring and Other Receivables 
    
  We sold accounts receivable of   $25 million   in the third quarter of   2016   and   $102 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and received cash of   $25 million   in the third quarter of   2016   and   $101 million   for the nine months of   2016  . The loss recognized on these sales was   $0.1 million   in the third quarter and   $0.4 million   for the nine months of 2016. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold   $28 million   of accounts receivable and recognized a loss of   $0.1 million  . Our factoring transactions in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were recognized as sales, and the proceeds are included in operating cash flows in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we accepted a note with a face value of   $120 million   from PDVSA in exchange for   $120 million   in trade receivables. The note has a   three   year term at a   6.5%   stated interest rate. We may decide to sell this note in the future and have classified the note in  Other Non-Current Assets  on the accompanying   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . We carry the note at lower of cost or fair value and recognized a loss in the second quarter of 2016 of   $84 million   to adjust the note to fair value. 
    
  Ratings Services  Credit Rating 
    
  At September 30, 2016, our Standard   Poor s Global Rating remains at BB- for our senior unsecured debt and B for short-term debt both with a negative outlook. Our Moody s Corporate Family Rating remains at B1 for our unsecured debt and SGL-3 for our short-term debt with a negative outlook. Our Fitch Rating remains at B+ for our senior unsecured debt and B for our short-term debt with a negative outlook. We have access and expect we will continue to have access to most credit markets.

Cash Requirements 
    
  During 2016, we anticipate our cash requirements will include payments for capital expenditures, repayment of debt, interest payments on our outstanding debt, amounts to settle litigation related matters, severance and payments for short-term working capital needs. Our cash requirements may also include opportunistic debt repurchases and business acquisitions. We anticipate funding these requirements from cash generated from operations, availability under our existing or additional credit facilities, and if completed, proceeds from disposals of businesses or capital assets. We anticipate that cash generated from operations will be augmented by working capital improvements driven by capital discipline including further inventory reductions. Capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to be approximately   $200 million  , which will be   71%   lower than capital expenditures of   $682 million   in 2015. The amounts we ultimately spend will depend on a number of factors including the type of contracts we enter into, asset availability and our expectations with respect to industry activity levels in the following year. Expenditures are expected to be used primarily to support ongoing activities of our core businesses, and our sources of liquidity are anticipated to be sufficient to meet our needs.  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents of   $439 million   at   September 30, 2016   are held by subsidiaries outside of Ireland. Based on the nature of our structure, we are generally able to redeploy cash with no incremental tax.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $122 million   of our cash and cash equivalent balance was denominated in Angolan kwanza. The National Bank of Angola supervises all kwanza exchange operations and has limited U.S. Dollar conversions. Prolonged Angolan exchange limitations may limit our ability to repatriate earnings and expose us to additional exchange rate risk.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We prepare these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes or developments in our evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies that we believe to be critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Forward-Looking Statements    
    
  This report contains various statements relating to future financial performance and results, including certain projections, business trends and other statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believe,   project,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   intend,   budget,   strategy,   plan,   guidance,   outlook,   may,   should,   could,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely result,  and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
    
  Forward-looking statements reflect our beliefs and expectations based on current estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations, and the estimates and projections on which they are based, are reasonable and were made in good faith, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. Furthermore, from time to time, we update the various factors we consider in making our forward-looking statements and the assumptions we use in those statements. However, we undertake no obligation to correct, update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except to the extent required under federal securities laws. The following sets forth various assumptions we use in our forward-looking statements, as well as risks and uncertainties relating to those statements. Certain of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in forward-looking statements in this report and in our other disclosures. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described below under    Part II   Other Information     Item 1A.   Risk Factors    and the following: 
             
    the price volatility of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, including the impact of the significant decline in the price of crude oil; 
                
    global political, economic and market conditions, political disturbances, war, terrorist attacks, changes in global trade policies, and international currency fluctuations; 
                
    nonrealization of expected benefits from our acquisitions or business dispositions and our ability to execute such acquisitions and dispositions; 
                
    our ability to realize expected revenues and profitability levels from current and future contracts; 
                
    our ability to manage our workforce, supply chain and business processes, information technology systems and technological innovation and commercialization, including the impact of our cost reduction plans; 
                
    our high level of indebtedness; 
                
    increases in the prices and availability of our raw materials; 
                
    potential non-cash asset impairment charges for long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets or other assets; 
                
    changes to our effective tax rate; 
                
    nonrealization of potential earnouts associated with business dispositions; 
                
    downturns in our industry which could affect the carrying value of our goodwill; 
                
    member-country quota compliance within OPEC; 
                
    adverse weather conditions in certain regions of our operations; 
                
    our ability to realize the expected benefits from our redomestication from Switzerland to Ireland and to maintain our Swiss tax residency; 
                
    failure to ensure on-going compliance with current and future laws and government regulations, including but not limited to environmental and tax and accounting laws, rules and regulations; and 
                
    limited access to capital, significantly higher cost of capital or difficulty raising additional funds in the equity or debt capital markets.  
       
  Finally, our future results will depend upon various other risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in our other filings with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and the Securities Act of 1933. For additional information regarding risks and uncertainties, see our other filings with the SEC. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on our web site www.weatherford.com under  Investor Relations  as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed the material with, or furnished it to, the SEC.

  For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see    Part II   Other Information      Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since   December 31, 2015  , except as described under the subheading    Currency Devaluation Charges    of     Note 1   General    to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. This information is collected and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our management identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
    
  Disputes and Litigation 
    
  See    Note 17   Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies    to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our ongoing disputes and litigation.  
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  In December 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) conducted an investigation and records review regarding our pressure pumping facilities for perceived violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ). The EPA has alleged that we failed to meet RCRA notification requirements and failed to operate within its stated generator status. During the second quarter of 2016, we accrued   $244,728   as the expected fine.   In addition, Weatherford self-reported waste generation notification deficiencies involving five additional Weatherford facilities. As a result, in the third quarter of 2016  , we increased the accrual to $335,200.   A settlement for all alleged violations is being incorporated into a Consent Agreement and Final Order with the EPA.    

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
    
  An investment in our securities involves various risks. You should consider carefully all of the risk factors described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part I, under the heading    Item 1A.   Risk Factors    and other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. There have been no material changes in our assessment of our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .
