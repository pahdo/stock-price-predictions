Note 1   Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Description of
the Business    

Sensus Healthcare, Inc. (the  Company )
is a manufacturer of superficial radiation therapy devices and has established a distribution and marketing network to sell the
devices to healthcare providers globally. The Company was organized on May 7, 2010 as a limited liability corporation. On January
1, 2016, the Company completed a corporate conversion pursuant to which Sensus Healthcare, Inc. succeeded to the business of Sensus
Healthcare, LLC. The Company operates as one segment from its corporate headquarters located in Boca Raton, Florida. 

Initial Public
Offering    

In June 2016, the Company issued 2,300,000
units in its initial public offering ( IPO ) at a price of $5.50 per unit ($5.25 attributable to the common stock and
$0.25 attributable to the warrant), for net proceeds of approximately $10,393,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
of $886,000 and expenses of $1,371,000. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of
common stock. Immediately prior to the IPO, all shares of stock then outstanding converted into an aggregate of 10,367,883 shares
of common stock following a 241.95-for-one forward stock split approved by the Company s board of directors. On July 25,
2016, the common stock and warrants included in the units issued in the IPO commenced trading separately under the symbols  SRTS 
and  SRTSW,  respectively, and trading of the units under the symbol  SRTSU  was suspended. 

Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, or GAAP, and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. 
Accordingly, they do not include certain footnotes and financial presentations normally required under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.   The interim financial information is unaudited,
but reflects all normal adjustments and accruals which are, in the opinion of management, considered necessary to provide a fair
presentation for the interim periods presented. The accompanying condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s
final prospectus dated June 2, 2016, filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to
the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-209451), filed with the SEC. The results for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016, any other interim periods, or any future year or period. 

Use of Estimates    

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates to which
it is reasonably possible that a change could occur in the near term include, revenue recognition, inventory reserves, receivable
allowances, recoverability of long lived assets and estimation of the Company s product warranties. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition    

The Company s sales primarily relate
to sales of the Company s devices. The Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive
evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, the sales price is fixed and determinable,
and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company does not provide a right of return related to product
sales. Revenues for service contracts are recognized over the service contract period on a straight-line basis. Revenue for rentals
of equipment is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

The Company sells products and services under
multiple-element arrangements with separate units of accounting; in these situations, total consideration is allocated to the identified
units of accounting based on their relative selling prices and revenue is then recognized for each unit based on its specific characteristics.
A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a
stand-alone basis. The principal deliverables in our multiple deliverable arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting
consist of (i) sales of medical devices and accessories and (ii) service contracts. Performance obligations, including installation
and customer training, are considered inconsequential and are combined with the product as one unit of accounting. Selling prices
are established using vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). 

If VSOE does not exist, the Company uses
its best estimate of the selling prices for the deliverables. The Company operates in a highly regulated environment and is continually
entering into new markets in which regulatory approval is sometimes required prior to the customer being able to use the product.
In these cases, where regulatory approval is pending, revenue is deferred until such time as regulatory approval is obtained and
customer acceptance becomes certain. 

Deferred revenue consists of payments from
customers for long term separately priced service contracts, sales pending regulatory approval and deposits on products. Deferred
revenue as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as follows: 

The Company provides warranties, generally
one year, in conjunction with the sale of its product. These warranties are short term in nature and entitle the customer to repair,
replacement, or modification of the defective product subject to the terms of the respective warranty. The Company records an estimate
of future warranty claims at the time the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of the product based upon management s
estimate of the future claims rate. 

Shipping and handling costs are expensed
as incurred and are included in cost of sales. 

Segment and Geographical
Information    

The Company s revenue is generated
primarily from customers in the United States, which represented approximately 100% and 85% of its net revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately 74% and 85% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Customers in China accounted for approximately 0% and 14% of revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 and approximately 15% and 14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents    

The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents
with financial institutions which balances exceed the federally insured limits. Federally insured limits are $250,000 for deposits.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $4,357,000 and $4,815,000, respectively in excess
of federally insured limits. 

For purposes of the statement of cash flows,
the Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be a cash
equivalent. 

Investments    

Short term
investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year and long term investments after
one year. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase as h eld-to-maturity and
reevaluates such classification on a quarterly basis. Held-to-maturity investments consist of securities that the Company
has the intent and ability to retain until maturity. These securities ar e carried at amortized cost
plus accrued interest and consist of the following:  

Accounts Receivable    

The Company does business and extends credit
based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses
on receivables is expected to vary by customer due to the financial condition of each customer. The Company monitors exposure to
credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses considered necessary under the circumstances. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was approximately $27,000 as of September 30, 2016 and approximately $27,000 as of December 31, 2015. To date, the Company
has not experienced significant credit-related losses. 

Property and Equipment    

Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; expenditures that enhance the value of property or extend their useful lives
are capitalized. When assets are sold or returned, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and the resulting gain or loss is included in income. 

Inventory units designated for customer demonstrations,
as part of the sales process, are reclassified to property and equipment and the depreciation is recorded to selling and marketing
expense. The inventory used for demonstrations that was reclassified to property and equipment for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $68,000 and $44,000, respectively. 

Inventory units designated for customer rental
agreements are reclassified to property and equipment and the depreciation is recorded to cost of sales. Inventory reclassified
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0 and $39,000, respectively. 

Intangible Assets    

Intangible assets are comprised of the Company s
patent rights and are amortized over the patents  estimated useful life of approximately 13 years. As of September 30, 2016
the remaining useful life was 81 months. 

Long-Lived Assets    

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets,
including intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or
related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows in accordance with accounting guidance. If circumstances
suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered, based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying values of such
assets are reduced to fair value. No impairment charges were recorded for long-lived assets for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. 

Earnings Per Share    

Basic net income (loss) per share attributable
to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method for options and warrants. The diluted net income
per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common share equivalents outstanding
for the period. In periods when the Company has incurred a net loss, options and warrants to purchase common shares are considered
common share equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders
as their effect is antidilutive. Shares excluded were computed under the treasury stock method as follows: 

Advertising Costs    

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged
to expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense included in selling expense in the accompanying statements of operations
amounted to approximately $168,000 and $70,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $687,000
and $455,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Deferred Initial
Public Offering Costs    

Deferred offering costs, which consist of
direct incremental legal, accounting and other fees relating to the IPO, are capitalized. The deferred offering costs were offset
against IPO proceeds upon the consummation of the offering. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $310,000 of deferred offering
costs were capitalized and included in deferred offering costs and other prepaids on the balance sheet. 

Note 2   Property
and Equipment   

Depreciation expense was approximately $60,000
and $55,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $181,000 and $175,000, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 3   Patent
Rights   

Amortization expense was approximately $24,000
for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $72,000 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, future remaining amortization expense is as follows: 

Note 4   Revolving
Credit Facility   

On March 12, 2013, the Company entered into
a 2-year $3 million revolving credit facility. The credit facility was amended and extended effective March 12, 2015 through May
12, 2017. The maximum borrowing was reduced to $1,500,000 and was limited by the Company s eligible borrowing base of 80%
of eligible accounts receivable. On September 21, 2016, a second amendment to the credit facility extended the facility through
September 21, 2017, increased the maximum borrowing to $2,000,000 and expanded the eligible accounts receivables to include certain
international receivables. 

Interest, at Prime plus 0.75% (4.25% at September
30, 2016), is payable monthly with outstanding principal and interest due on the maturity date. The facility is secured by all
of the Company s assets and limits the amount of additional indebtedness, restricts the sale, disposition or transfer of
assets of the Company and requires the maintenance of a certain monthly adjusted quick ratio restrictive covenant and minimum quarterly
EBITDA restrictive covenant, as defined in the agreement. Approximately $423,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility
at December 31, 2015 and $0 at September 30, 2016. The Company pays commitment fees of 0.25% per annum on the average unused portion
of the line of credit. 

Note 5   Product
Warranties   

Changes in product warranty liability were
as follows for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited). 

Note 6   Commitment
and Contingencies   

Operating Lease
Agreements    

In July 2016, the Company renewed a commercial
lease requiring monthly payments to an unrelated third party for its headquarters office. The renewal was effective September 1,
2016 and expanded the office space being occupied. The lease expires in September 2022 and lease payments increase by 3% annually.
Future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

Rental expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $24,000 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately
$74,000 and $73,000, respectively. 

Manufacturing Agreement    

In July 2010, the Company entered into a
three-year contract manufacturing agreement with an unrelated third party for the production and manufacture of the Company s
main product in accordance with the Company s product specifications. The Company continues to do business with the contract
manufacturer in accordance with the agreement. The Company or the manufacturer has the option to terminate the agreement with 90
days written notice. Any change in the relationship with the manufacturer could have an adverse effect on the Company s business. 

Purchases from this manufacturer totaled
approximately $713,000 and $888,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $2,998,000 and $1,855,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximately
$566,000 and $283,000, respectively, was due to this manufacturer, which is presented in accounts payable and accrued expenses
in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheets. 

Legal contingencies    

The Company is party to certain legal proceedings
in the ordinary course of business. The Company assesses, in conjunction with its legal counsel, the need to record a liability
for litigation and related contingencies. The Company does not believe that any legal proceedings are likely to have a material
effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Equity   

The Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares
of common stock, of which 13,546,170 and 10,367,883 shares were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. 

Stock Issuances    

On January 1, 2016, Sensus Healthcare, LLC
converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion and changed its name to Sensus Healthcare, Inc. As a result
of the corporate conversion, the holders of the different classes of units of Sensus Healthcare, LLC became holders of common stock
of Sensus Healthcare, Inc. Holders of warrants and options, respectively, to purchase membership interests of Sensus Healthcare,
LLC became holders of warrants and options to purchase common stock of Sensus Healthcare, Inc., respectively. Each membership interest
converted to one share of common stock. 

During 2011, the Company offered to a limited
number of investors (the  investor members ) preferred membership interests (the  interests ) consisting
of (i) cumulative, non-compounded, 8% per annum preferential return, payable annually, if and when such distributions are made
by the Company s board of directors and (ii) participation in the Company s net profits, net losses and distributions
of the Company s assets pursuant to the operating agreement. The offering raised approximately $6.4 million in gross proceeds
($6.0 million net of offering costs), utilizing a private placement memorandum. As of December 31, 2015, accumulated unpaid preferential
distributions were approximately $2,674,000 ($0.87 per share). Preferential distributions no longer accrued after December 31,
2015. In June 2016, after the completion of the IPO, the accumulated unpaid distribution as of December 31, 2015 was payable in
cash or shares, at the option of each stockholder with a preferential distribution. On July 15, 2016, the Company paid the accrued
dividends in the amount of approximately $2,553,000 representing the amount for which former holders of membership units with a
preferred return elected to receive dividends in cash. In addition, 23,138 shares valued at approximately $122,000 of common stock
were issued to those that elected to receive the dividends in shares. 

During 2014, the Company granted a 1% ownership
interest in the Company to an executive which was to vest upon a change in control of the Company. During 2015, the terms were
amended such that the ownership interest will vest in the event of involuntary termination or a liquidity event, as defined. In
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, compensation cost for awards with performance conditions
should be recorded in the Company s financial statements at which time that it is probable the performance condition is achieved.
As of December 31, 2015, the achievement of the performance condition was not probable and accordingly no compensation cost was
recorded. Following the IPO in June 2016, the performance condition was met and accordingly, stock compensation expense of approximately
$465,000 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The grant date fair value of the equity award was estimated
using both an income and market approach. Under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow method based on Company
projections, historical financial information and guideline company/industry growth and margin indicators. The discount rate applied
was based on the weighted average cost of capital of guideline public companies and was estimated at approximately 21%. The Company
also used a market approach to estimate its enterprise value based on a multiple of revenue and earnings of guideline public companies.
Using both of these approaches, management was able to estimate the fair value per share on the grant date which was approximately
$4.42 per share or approximately $465,000. 

Warrants    

In March 2011, the closing date of the preferred
offering, the Company s placement agent was granted investor rights to five year warrants to purchase preferred units, which
following the conversion were exercisable into 544,387 common shares of the Company at an exercise price of $2.08 per share. The
expiration of the warrants was extended and the warrants were exercised on June 10, 2016. One of the Company s directors
is a managing partner of and has voting and dispositive authority in the entity that exercised the warrants. 

In April 2013, the closing date of the second common
offering, the placement agent received investor rights to 5 year warrants to purchase 86,376 common shares of the Company at an
exercise price of $4.55 per unit, which was equal to 110% of the offering price. 

In June 2016, from the IPO, the investors
received three-year warrants to purchase 2,300,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.75 per share; the warrants
are exercisable through June 2, 2019. Following the first anniversary of the date of issuance, if certain conditions are met, the
Company may redeem any and all of the outstanding warrants at a price equal to $0.01 per warrant. 

In addition, the underwriter s representatives
received four-year warrants to purchase up to 138,000 units, consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase
one share of common stock. The warrants for the units are exercisable between June 2, 2017 and June 2, 2021 at an exercise price
of $6.75 per unit. 

All warrants reflect the 241.05-for-one forward
stock split and were fully vested as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The following table summarizes the Company s
warrant activity: 

The intrinsic value of the common stock warrants
was approximately $148,000 as of September 30, 2016, and approximately $0 as of December 31, 2015. 

2013 Option Plan    

The Company s 2013 option plan (the
 Plan ) permitted the grant of 90,731 options to purchase shares of common stock to its employees. Option awards were
generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company s common shares at the date of grant and
those option awards generally vested based on five years of continuous service. The awards provided for accelerated vesting if
there was a change in control as defined in the Plan. 

On November 1, 2013, the Company granted
two employees, options to purchase 7,258 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.13 per unit. In lieu of cash exercise,
the options also contained certain cashless exercise provisions however the net settlement amount remained fixed. The options were
to expire 10 years from the grant date and vest five years from the grant date. 

The fair value of each option was estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ( Black-Scholes Model). 

Upon the closing of the IPO, all options
issued under the Plan were automatically exercised using a cashless exercise feature and converted to 3,096 shares of common stock,
and the Option Plan was terminated. 

All options amounts reflect the 241.05-for-one
forward stock split. A summary of option activity under the Plan is as follows: 

The Company recognized approximately $22,000
and $2,000 of stock based compensation related to the grant of the options to its employees for nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and approximately $25,000 and $5,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

2016 equity incentive
Plan    

In February 2016, with stockholder approval,
the Company adopted the Sensus Healthcare, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ). Pursuant to the 2016
Plan, our directors, officers and other key employees who have been selected as participants are eligible to receive awards of
various forms of equity-based incentive compensation, including incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock awards, performance shares and phantom stock, and awards consisting of combinations of such incentives. The 2016
Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the 2016 Plan, the Compensation Committee has
the authority to establish, adopt, revise or rescind such rules and regulations and to make all such determinations relating to
the 2016 Plan as it may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2016 Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2016
Plan, the Compensation Committee has sole discretionary authority to interpret the 2016 Plan and to determine the type of awards
to grant, when, if, and to whom awards are granted, the number of shares covered by each award and the terms and conditions of
the award. The term of the 2016 Plan is 10 years from the effective date, after which no further awards may be granted thereunder. 

The Company has limited the aggregate number
of shares of common stock to be awarded under the 2016 Plan to 397,473 shares and no more than 397,473 shares of common stock in
the aggregate may be granted in connection with incentive stock options. In addition, unless the Compensation Committee specifically
determines otherwise, the maximum number of shares available under the 2016 Plan and the awards granted under the 2016 Plan will
be subject to appropriate adjustment in the case of any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, mergers,
consolidations, exchanges or other changes in capitalization affecting our common stock. Any shares granted in connection with
options and stock appreciation rights shall be counted against this limit as one share for every one share allotted in connection
with the awarded option or stock appreciation right. Any shares granted in connection with awards other than options and stock
appreciation rights shall be counted against this limit as two shares for every one share granted in connection with such award
or by which the award is valued by reference. 

On June 2, 2016, 307,666 shares of restricted
stock were issued to employees and were recorded at the fair value of $5.25 as per the initial offering price. The shares vest
25% per year over a four-year vesting period and are being recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period
of the awards. Stock compensation expense of approximately $101,000 was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and $135,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Unrecognized stock compensation expense was approximately $1,481,000
as of September 30, 2016, which will be recognized over the remaining vesting period. 

Note 8   Income
Taxes   

Through December 31, 2015, the Company was
not subject to income taxes in any jurisdiction because it was a limited liability company taxed as a partnership. Each member
of the Company was responsible for the tax liability, if any, related to their proportionate share of the Company s taxable
income. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company converted to a C-corporation and is subject to corporate income taxes. 

The Company did not recognize income tax
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 since it does not expect to have taxable income in 2016. 

There are no uncertain tax positions that
would require recognition in the financial statements. If the Company incurs an income tax liability in the future, interest on
any income tax liability would be reported as interest expense and penalties on any income tax liability would be reported as income
taxes. The Company s conclusions regarding uncertain tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date
based upon ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof as well as other factors. 

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. 

As of September 30, 2016, the tax years 2013,
2014 and 2015 were subject to examination. 

Note 9   Subsequent
Events   

The Company evaluates subsequent events and
transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued for potential recognition
or disclosure. The Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial
statements.

Overview  

Sensus Healthcare, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the  Company ), was formed on May 7, 2010, to design, manufacture and market proprietary medical devices specializing
in the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers and other skin conditions, such as keloids, with superficial radiation therapy. In
June 2010, Sensus Healthcare, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Sensus (FL) ) acquired all the assets associated
with our primary product, the SRT-100, from Topex, Inc. for $1.3 million. Following this acquisition, we relaunched the SRT-100
under the Sensus Healthcare brand. In December 2011, we merged with Sensus (FL), with the Delaware limited liability company surviving
the merger for the purpose of changing our domicile from Florida to Delaware. On January 1, 2016, Sensus Healthcare, LLC converted
into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion and we changed our name to Sensus Healthcare, Inc. As a result of
the corporate conversion, all holders of units of Sensus Healthcare, LLC became holders of common stock of Sensus Healthcare, Inc.
Holders of warrants and options to purchase units of Sensus Healthcare, LLC became holders of warrants and options to purchase
common stock of Sensus Healthcare, Inc., respectively. 

The SRT-100 is a photon x-ray low energy superficial radiotherapy
system that provides patients an alternative to surgery for treating non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous
cell skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids. The SRT-100 is especially effective in treating primary lesions that
would otherwise be difficult or require extensive surgery involving sensitive areas of the head and neck regions, such as the fold
in the nose, eyelids, lips, corner of the mouth, and the lining of the ear, that would otherwise lead to a less than desirable
cosmetic outcome. Superficial radiation therapy treatment procedures do not require the use of anesthetics and eliminates the need
for skin grafting. The SRT-100 provides healthcare providers and patients with a safe, virtually painless, and substantially non-scarring
treatment option for non-melanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions, such as keloids. It allows dermatologists to retain non-melanoma
skin cancer patients, rather than referring them to specialists, while offering radiation oncologists an alternative to costly
linear accelerator based treatments with a process that is less invasive, more time-efficient, and improves practice economics.
Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our SRT-100 product line. 

Corporate conversion   

The purpose of the corporate conversion was to reorganize our
corporate structure so that we are a corporation rather than a limited liability company and so that our existing investors own
our common stock rather than equity interests in a limited liability company. References elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q to our capitalization and other matters pertaining to our equity and shares prior to the corporate conversion relate
to the capitalization and equity and shares of Sensus Healthcare, LLC, and after the corporate conversion, to Sensus Healthcare,
Inc. 

Components of our results of operations   

We manage our business globally within one reportable segment,
which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and
assesses operating performance. 

Revenue   

Our sales primarily relate to sales of our devices. We recognize
product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding
customer acceptance, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
We do not provide a right of return related to product sales. Revenues for service contracts are recognized over the service contract
period on a straight-line basis. Revenue for rentals of equipment is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

We sell products and services under multiple-element arrangements
with separate units of accounting; in these situations, total consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting
based on their relative selling prices and revenue is then recognized for each unit based on its specific characteristics. A deliverable
in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis.
The principal deliverables in our multiple deliverable arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting consist of (i)
sales of medical devices and accessories and (ii) service contracts. Performance obligations, including installation and customer
training, are considered inconsequential and are combined with the product as one unit of accounting. Selling prices are established
using vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ). If VSOE does not exist, we use our best estimate of the selling
prices for the deliverables. 

We operate in a highly regulatory environment and are continually
entering into new markets in which state or foreign approval is sometimes required prior to the customer being able to use the
product. In these cases, where regulatory approval is pending, revenue is deferred until such time regulatory approval is obtained
and customer acceptance becomes certain. 

Deferred revenue consists of payments from customers for separately
priced service contracts, sales pending regulatory approval and deposits on products. 

We provide warranties, generally one year, in conjunction with
the sale of our product. These warranties are short term in nature and entitle the customer to repair, replacement, or modification
of a defective product subject to the terms of the respective warranty. We record an estimate of future warranty claims at the
time we recognize revenue from the sale of the product based upon management s estimate of the future claims rate. 

Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are
included in cost of sales. 

We expect revenue to increase in the future as we expand our
sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to support growth in the U.S. and internationally and the SRT-100 becomes more widely
adopted and new products are introduced. 

Cost of sales   

Since July 2010, we have used a third party manufacturer for
the production and manufacture of our main products, the SRT-100 product line, in accordance with our product specifications. Cost
of sales consists primarily of direct material, direct labor, overhead, depreciation and amortization. A significant portion of
our cost of sales consists of costs paid to our third party manufacturer. 

Gross profit   

We calculate gross profit as net revenue less cost of sales.
Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including average selling price, manufacturing
costs, production volumes, product reliability and the implementation over time of cost-reduction strategies. Our gross profit
may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 

Selling and marketing   

We focus on two primary markets, private dermatology practices
and radiation oncologists in both private and hospital settings. We currently employ a multi-tier sales strategy in an attempt
to optimize geographic coverage and focus on what we perceive to be our key markets. This multi-tier sales model uses a direct
salesforce, international dealers and distributors, and, to a much lesser degree, regional independent sales representatives compensated
on a commission-only basis. We expect the amount of our sales and marketing expense to increase as we continue to expand our sales
force and marketing activities. 

General and administrative   

General and administrative expense, or G A, consists primarily
of salaries, employee benefits, bonuses, and related costs for personnel who support our general operations such as executive management,
finance, accounting and administrative functions, as well as Board fees, legal and other professional fees, director and officer
insurance and other public company expenses. 

Research and development   

We expect the amount of our research and development, or R D,
expense to increase as we continue to innovate and introduce new products and technologies. 

Other income (expense)   

Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest earned
on cash balances and investments less interest payments made pursuant to our secured credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and.
Our interest expense will fluctuate in future periods to the extent we incur additional, or pay down, indebtedness. 

Income taxes   

Until December 31, 2015, the Company was a limited liability
corporation (LLC) that had elected to be taxed as a pass-through entity and accordingly, we did not recognize a federal or state
income tax provision. Beginning in 2016, as a result of the conversion from an LLC to a Delaware corporation, income tax (benefit)
expense will consist of income taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We will be taxed at the rates applicable within
each jurisdiction in which we operate or generate revenue. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different
interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining
our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred
tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those
tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization
of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. 

Significant trends and uncertainties impacting our business   

Many third party payors follow coverage decisions and payment
amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the U.S. Medicare program, in setting
their coverage and reimbursement policies. Beginning in 2013, the AMA CPT  Editorial Panel, or the AMA, commenced a review
of the reportable codes during an episode of superficial radiation therapy, including a recommendation to eliminate several reportable
codes used for superficial radiation therapy. During this review, future reimbursement levels became uncertain. This uncertainty
significantly impacted sales of our products in 2014 as many of our customers delayed purchasing decisions until the reimbursement
review was completed. At the conclusion of the review at the end of 2014, and effective January 1, 2015, the total reimbursement
for an episode of care remained similar to the reimbursement prior to the review; however, we believe that the uncertainty during
2014 regarding the final rates for 2015 had a significant negative impact on our 2014 sales. While a number of codes used for superficial
radiation therapy were no longer reportable in 2015, the AMA indicated alternative codes could be reported for a common episode
of care, therefore compensating for the impact of the eliminated codes. As the uncertainty of the reimbursement has subsided, our
sales in 2015 returned to 2013 levels. In 2015, CMS reviewed the value of the superficial radiation therapy treatment delivery
code value for 2016 and made a slight increase. 

Results of Operations  

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015   

Total revenue.    Total revenue was $3,327,830
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,107,520 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $1,220,310, or 57.9%. The growth in revenue was attributable to an increase in systems sold as well as a higher percentage of
sales of the higher priced SRT-100 Vision product in the current quarter. 

Total cost of sales.   Cost of sales was $1,076,821
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $691,356 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
$385,465, or 55.8%. The increase in cost was due to a greater number of systems sold during the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015. 

Gross profit.    Gross profit was $2,251,009
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,416,164 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $834,845, or 59.0%, for the reasons discussed above. Our overall gross profit percentage was 67.6% in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to 67.2% in the corresponding period in 2015. 

Selling and marketing.    Selling and
marketing expense was $1,115,752 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $752,348 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $363,404, or 48.3%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and higher
participation in tradeshows and other marketing activities. 

General and administrative.    General
and administrative expense was $789,718 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $379,640 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $410,078, or 108.0%. The increase was due primarily to Board fees, director and officer
insurance and other public company expenses incurred in 2016 following our IPO. 

Research and development.    Research and development
expense was $389,759 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $358,490 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, an increase of $31,269, or 8.7%. The increase in research and development spending was primarily attributable to regulatory
expenses related to the SRT-100 Vision. 

Other income (expense).   We incur interest
expense in connection with our secured credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and interest income from our investment held-to-maturity
securities. 

Income taxes.   We expect the effective tax
rate for the year 2016 to be 0.0%. Prior to January 1, 2016, we were a limited liability company taxed as a partnership and therefore
did not incur income tax expense. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine
months ended September 30, 2015   

Total revenue.    Total revenue was $9,933,977
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,432,553 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
$3,501,424, or 54.4%. The growth in revenue was attributable to significantly more systems sold as well as a higher percentage
of sales of the more expensive SRT-100 Vision product in the current year. 

Total cost of sales.   Cost of sales was $3,429,967
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,263,181 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
$1,166,786, or 51.6%. The increase in cost was due to a greater number of systems sold for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015. 

Gross profit.    Gross profit was $6,504,010
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4,169,372 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
$2,334,638, or 56.0%, for the reasons discussed above. Our overall gross profit percentage was 65.5% in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 64.8% in the corresponding period in 2015. 

Selling and marketing.    Selling and
marketing expense was $3,244,364 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,600,594 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $643,770, or 24.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and higher
participation in tradeshows and other marketing activities. 

General and administrative.    General
and administrative expense was $2,546,262 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,078,812 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,467,450, or 136.0%. The increase was due primarily to stock compensation, Board fees,
director and officer insurance and other public company expenses incurred in 2016 following our IPO. Approximately $465,000 of
the total $571,000 stock compensation expense was a one-time charge in the second quarter related to a restricted stock grant that
fully vested with the completion of our IPO. 

Research and development.    Research and development
expense was $1,096,789 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,132,419 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $35,630, or 3.1%. The decrease in research and development spending was primarily attributable to the completion
of research and development and regulatory expenses for the SRT-100 Vision product. 

Other income (expense).   We incur interest
expense in connection with our secured credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and interest income from our investment held-to-maturity. 

Income taxes.    We expect the effective
tax rate for the year 2016 to be 0.0%. Prior to January 1, 2016, we were a limited liability company taxed as a partnership and
therefore did not incur income tax expense. 

The following
supplemental financial information is determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Management uses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in its analysis
of performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures nor should it be viewed as a substitute
for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, which excludes
the impact of interest expense, income and other taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, and litigation
settlement expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results
of Sensus Healthcare. Non-GAAP financial measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods
that differ from those used by the Company. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, management believes that adjusted EBITDA
assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that
may obscure underlying performance and distort comparability. A reconciliation of the GAAP net loss to adjusted EBITDA is provided
in the schedule below.

(unaudited)  

Financial Condition  

Our cash, cash equivalent and investment balance increased from
$5.1 million at December 31, 2015 to $11.2 million at September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the IPO completed in June 2016. 

Borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of December
31, 2015 were repaid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The unused line of credit was $2 million at September 30,
2016. 

(1) Taxes include all taxes paid by the Company,
other than payroll taxes, including on income, ad valorem, and excise taxes. The Company did not recognize income tax
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Overview   

Our liquidity position and capital requirements
may be impacted by a number of factors, including the following: 

our ability to generate and increase revenue;   

fluctuations in gross margins, operating expenses and net results; and   

fluctuations in working capital.   

Our primary short-term capital needs, which
are subject to change, include expenditures related to: 

expansion of our sales, marketing and distribution activities;   

expansion of our research and development activities.   

We regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations,
commitments, capital requirements and business development transactions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes
in the future. 

Cash flows   

The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for
the periods indicated: 

Cash flows from operating activities   

Net cash used in operating activities was $2,339,670 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisting of a net loss of $379,632 and an increase in net operating assets of $2,936,671,
offset by non-cash charges of $976,633. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to the increase in sales resulting
in an increase in accounts receivable as well as an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses and a decrease in account payable
and accrued expenses. Non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. Net
cash used in operating activities was $1,253,645 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the net loss and
the increase in accounts receivable and deferred offering costs and other prepaids, less an increase in accounts payable offset
by a decrease in deferred revenue. 

Cash flows from investing activities   

Net cash used in investing activities was $6,839,959 due to
the purchase of debt securities held-to-maturity for $6,577,522 and $262,437 for acquisition of property and equipment during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in investing activities was $83,037 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cash flows from financing activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities was $8,722,250 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of which $10,523,438 was the net proceeds of the IPO, $1,132,538 from the exercise of
warrants, less $2,511,024 used for the payment of dividends to former preferred investors and $422,702 used for the repayment of
outstanding borrowing under the line of credit. Net cash used in financing activities was $225,000 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 for repayment of outstanding borrowing under the line of credit. 

Indebtedness   

Silicon Valley Bank Secured Credit Facility   

On March 12, 2013, the Company entered into a 2-year $3 million
revolving credit facility. The credit facility was amended and extended effective March 12, 2015 through May 12, 2017. The maximum
borrowing was reduced to $1,500,000 and was limited by the Company s eligible borrowing base of 80% of eligible accounts
receivable. On September 21, 2016, a second amendment to the credit facility extended the facility through September 21, 2017,
increased the maximum borrowing to $2,000,000 and expanded the eligible accounts receivables to include certain international receivables. 

Interest, at Prime plus 0.75% (4.25% at September 30, 2016),
is payable monthly with outstanding principal and interest due on the maturity date. The facility is secured by all of the Company s
assets and limits the amount of additional indebtedness, restricts the sale, disposition or transfer of assets of the Company and
requires the maintenance of a certain monthly adjusted quick ratio restrictive covenant and minimum quarterly EBITDA restrictive
covenant, as defined in the agreement. Approximately $423,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31,
2015 and $0 at September 30, 2016. The Company pays commitment fees of 0.25% per annum on the average unused portion of the line
of credit. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We did not have during the periods presented, and do not currently
have, any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the U.S., or GAAP. We have identified certain accounting policies as critical to understanding our financial condition
and results of our operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes
to our financial statements and our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on June 2, 2016
related to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-209451) for our initial public offering. 

JOBS Act  

We qualify as an  emerging growth company  pursuant
to the provisions of the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an  emerging growth company,  we may take advantage of certain
exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth
companies,  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
statements, reduced disclosure obligations relating to the presentation of financial statements in Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory  say-on-pay 
votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We have availed ourselves of the
reduced reporting obligations and executive compensation disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and expect to continue
to avail ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations available to emerging growth companies in future filings. 

In addition, an emerging growth company can delay its adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to  opt
out  of such extended transition period, and as a result, we plan to comply with any new or revised accounting standards
on the relevant dates on which non-emerging growth companies must adopt such standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that
our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered
by this Form 10-Q, we maintained effective disclosure controls and procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has reviewed our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most
recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Item 1A.   
         Risk Factors    

An investment in our securities involves risks. You should carefully
consider the risk factors as previously disclosed in our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
SEC, on June 2, 2016 related to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-209451) for our initial public
offering, together with the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the financial statements and related
notes, before deciding whether to purchase, hold, or sell our securities. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business,
financial condition, or results of operations or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described
when evaluating our business. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in our final prospectus

Item 2.   
         Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    

(a) Sales of Unregistered Securities  

None. 

(b) Use of Proceeds from the Sale of Registered Securities  

On June 8, 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or
IPO, of units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. In connection with
the IPO, we issued 2,300,000 units of our common stock at a price of $5.50 per unit, including 300,000 units pursuant to the underwriters 
full exercise of their over-allotment option for an aggregate offering price of $12.65 million. The offer and sale of all of the
securities in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File
No. 333-209451), which was declared effective by the SEC on June 2, 2016. The registration statement registered an aggregate of
2,300,000 units, including 300,000 units to cover the over-allotment option. The offering commenced on June 2, 2016 and did not
terminate before all of the units in the IPO that were registered in the registration statement were sold. Northland Securities,
Inc. and Neidiger, Tucker, Bruner, Inc. acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. 

We received total net proceeds from the IPO of approximately
$10.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $0.9 million and other offering expenses
of approximately $1.4 million. 

The net proceeds from the IPO have been invested in highly-liquid
money market funds and investments in debt securities with maturities of 18 months or less. There has been no material change in
the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Securities Act on June 2, 2016.

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AND
SECURITY AGREEMENT  

THIS SECOND AMENDED
AND RESTATED LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  (this     Agreement  ) dated as of September 21, 2016 (the   Effective
Date  ) between  SILICON VALLEY BANK , a California corporation (  Bank  ), and  SENSUS HEALTHCARE,
INC.  (f/k/a Sensus Healthcare, LLC), a Delaware corporation (  Borrower  ), provides the terms on which Bank
shall lend to Borrower and Borrower shall repay Bank. The parties agree as follows: 

Recitals  

A.           Bank
and Borrower have entered into that certain Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 12, 2013 (as amended,
the   Prior Loan Agreement  ). 

B.           Borrower
has requested, and Bank has agreed, to replace, amend and restate the Prior Loan Agreement in its entirety. Bank and Borrower hereby
agree that the Prior Loan Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

1     ACCOUNTING AND OTHER TERMS   

Accounting terms not
defined in this Agreement shall be construed following GAAP. Calculations and determinations must be made following GAAP;  provided 
that if at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan
Document, and either Borrower or Bank shall so request, Borrower and Bank shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or
requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP;  provided, further , that, until so amended,
(a) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (b) Borrower
shall provide Bank financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder
setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change
in GAAP. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in Section 13. All other terms
contained in this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, shall have the meaning provided by the Code to the extent such terms are
defined therein. 

2     LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT   

2.1          Promise to Pay .
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay Bank the outstanding   principal amount of all Credit Extensions and accrued
and unpaid interest thereon as and when due in accordance with this Agreement. 

2.1.1      Revolving
Advances .    

(a)          Availability .
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to deduction of Reserves, Bank shall make Advances not exceeding
the Availability Amount. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line may be repaid and, prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date,
reborrowed, subject to the applicable terms and conditions precedent herein. Any Obligations outstanding under the Prior Loan Agreement
on the Effective Date shall, as of the Effective Date, be deemed to be Advances hereunder, and shall be subject to the terms and
conditions herein, including, without limitation, the terms of Section 2.2 below. 

(b)          Termination;
Repayment . The Revolving Line terminates on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, when the principal amount of all Advances,
the unpaid interest thereon, and all other Obligations relating to the Revolving Line shall be immediately due and payable. 

2.2          Overadvances .
If, at any time, the outstanding principal amount of the aggregate Advances   exceeds the lesser of either the Revolving Line
or the Borrowing Base, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank in cash the amount of such excess (such excess, the   Overadvance  ).
Without limiting Borrower s obligation to repay Bank any Overadvance, Borrower agrees to pay Bank interest on the outstanding
amount of any Overadvance, on demand, at the Default Rate. 

2.3    Payment of Interest on the Credit Extensions . 

(a)           Advances .
Subject to Section 2.3(b), the principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Line shall accrue interest at a floating per annum
rate equal to (i) during any Streamline Period, three-quarters of one percentage point (0.75%) above the Prime Rate, and (ii) during
any Non-Streamline Period, two and one-half percentage points (2.50%) above the Prime Rate, in either case, which interest shall
be payable monthly in accordance with Section 2.3(d) below. 

(b)          Default
Rate . Immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Obligations shall bear interest
at a rate per annum which is five percentage points (5.00%) above the rate that is otherwise applicable thereto (the   Default
Rate  ). Fees and expenses which are required to be paid by Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, Bank Expenses) but are not paid when due shall bear interest until paid at a rate equal to the highest rate applicable
to the Obligations. Payment or acceptance of the increased interest rate provided in this Section 2.3(b) is not a permitted alternative
to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies
of Bank. 

(c)          Adjustment
to Interest Rate . Changes to the interest rate of any Credit Extension based on changes to the Prime Rate shall be effective
on the effective date of any change to the Prime Rate and to the extent of any such change. 

(d)          Payment;
Interest Computation . Interest is payable monthly on the last calendar day of each month and shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. In computing interest, (i) all payments received after 12:00 p.m.
Pacific time on any day shall be deemed received at the opening of business on the next Business Day, and (ii) the date of the
making of any Credit Extension shall be included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if any Credit
Extension is repaid on the same day on which it is made, such day shall be included in computing interest on such Credit Extension. 

2.4    Fees . Borrower shall pay to Bank: 

(a)          Commitment
Fee . A fully earned, non-refundable commitment fee of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500), on the Effective Date; 

(b)          Termination
Fee . Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date, in addition to the
payment of any other amounts then-owing, a termination fee in an amount equal to one-half of one percent (0.50%) of the Revolving
Line, provided that no termination fee shall be charged if the credit facility hereunder is replaced with a new facility from Bank; 

(c)          Unused
Revolving Line Facility Fee . Payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of each calendar quarter occurring prior
to the Revolving Line Maturity Date, and on the Revolving Line Maturity Date (or upon any earlier termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 2.4(b)), a fee (the   Unused Revolving   Line Facility Fee  ) in an amount equal
to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum of the average unused   portion of the Revolving Line, as determined by Bank.
The unused portion of the Revolving Line, for purposes of this calculation, shall be calculated on a calendar year basis and shall
equal the difference between (i) the Revolving Line, and (ii) the average for the period of the daily closing balance of the Revolving
Line outstanding; and 

(d)          Bank
Expenses . All Bank Expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses for documentation and negotiation
of this Agreement) incurred through and after the Effective Date, when due (or, if no stated due date, upon demand by Bank). 

(e)          Fees
Fully Earned . Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or in a separate writing by Bank, Borrower shall not be entitled
to any credit, rebate, or repayment of any fees earned by Bank pursuant to this Agreement notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement or the suspension or termination of Bank s obligation to make loans and advances hereunder. Bank may deduct amounts
owing by Borrower under the clauses of this Section 2.4 pursuant to the terms of Section 2.5(c). Bank shall provide Borrower prompt
written notice of deductions made from the Designated Deposit Account pursuant to the terms of the clauses of this Section 2.4. 

2.5    Payments; Application of Payments; Debit of Accounts . 

(a)         All
payments to be made by Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made in immediately available funds in Dollars, without setoff
or counterclaim, before 12:00 p.m. Pacific time on the date when due. Payments of principal and/or interest received after 12:00
p.m. Pacific time are considered received at the opening of business on the next Business Day. When a payment is due on a day that
is not a Business Day, the payment shall be due the next Business Day, and additional fees or interest, as applicable, shall continue
to accrue until paid. 

(b)         Bank
has the exclusive right to determine the order and manner in which all payments with respect to the Obligations may be applied.
Borrower shall have no right to specify the order or the accounts to which Bank shall allocate or apply any payments required to
be made by Borrower to Bank or otherwise received by Bank under this Agreement when any such allocation or application is not specified
elsewhere in this Agreement. 

(c)         Bank
may debit the Designated Deposit Account for principal and interest payments or any other amounts Borrower owes Bank when due.
These debits shall not constitute a set-off. 

2.6    Lockbox; Account Collection Services . 

(a)         So
long as Borrower maintains an Adjusted Quick Ratio, tested monthly, of at least 2.00 to 1.00, and so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall have the right to collect all Accounts. Upon either (i) the occurrence of an Event
of Default, or (ii) Borrower s Adjusted Quick Ratio dropping below 2.00 to 1.00 (the occurrence of either (i) or (ii), the
  Lockbox Triggering Event  ), Borrower shall direct each Account Debtor (and each depository institution where
proceeds of Accounts are on deposit) to remit payments with respect to the Accounts to a lockbox account established with Bank
or to wire transfer payments to a cash collateral account that Bank controls (collectively, the   Lockbox  ).
It will be considered an immediate Event of Default if the Lockbox is not established and operational within thirty (30) days of
the Lockbox Triggering Event and at all times thereafter. 

(b)         Following
the Lockbox Triggering Event, but prior to the establishment of the Lockbox, the proceeds of the Accounts shall be paid by the
Account Debtors to an address consented to by Bank. Following the Lockbox Triggering Event, upon receipt by Borrower of any proceeds
of Accounts, Borrower shall immediately transfer and deliver same to Bank, along with a detailed cash receipts journal. 

(c)         Following
the Lockbox Triggering Event, all collections of Accounts (  Collections  ) shall be applied within three (3)
days of receipt of such amounts by Bank as follows: (i) during any Non-Streamline Period, all Collections shall be applied to the
outstanding Obligations owed by Borrower under the Revolving Line, and provided no Event of Default exists or an event that with
notice or lapse of time will be an Event of Default, the amount of Collections in excess of the outstanding Obligations owed by
Borrower under the Revolving Line shall be deposited in the Designated Deposit Account, and (ii) during any Streamline Period,
all Collections shall be deposited in the Designated Deposit Account, provided no Event of Default exists or an event that with
notice or lapse of time will be an Event of Default. This Section does not impose any affirmative duty on Bank to perform any act
other than as specifically set forth herein. All Accounts and the proceeds thereof are Collateral and if an Event of Default occurs,
Bank may apply the proceeds of such Accounts to the Obligations in accordance with Section 9.4 hereof. Following the Lockbox Triggering
Event, if Borrower receives any payment on or any proceeds of any Account, whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Borrower shall hold all such payments and proceeds in trust for Bank, and Borrower shall immediately deliver all
such payments and proceeds to Bank in their original form, duly endorsed, to be applied (i) prior to an Event of Default, pursuant
to the terms of this Section 2.6(c) hereof, and (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, pursuant
to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof. 

2.7         Withholding.
 Payments received by Bank from Borrower under this Agreement will be made   free and clear of and without deduction for
any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, withholdings, assessments, fees or other charges imposed
by any Governmental Authority (including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto). Specifically, however,
if at any time any Governmental Authority, applicable law, regulation or international agreement requires Borrower to make any
withholding or deduction from any such payment or other sum payable hereunder to Bank, Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that
the amount due from Borrower with respect to such payment or other sum payable hereunder will be increased to the extent necessary
to ensure that, after the making of such required withholding or deduction, Bank receives a net sum equal to the sum which it would
have received had no withholding or deduction been required, and Borrower shall pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority. Borrower will, upon request, furnish Bank with proof reasonably satisfactory to Bank indicating
that Borrower has made such withholding payment; provided, however, that Borrower need not make any withholding payment if the
amount or validity of such withholding payment is contested in good faith by appropriate and timely proceedings and as to which
payment in full is bonded or reserved against by Borrower. The agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in this Section

condition precedent to any Credit Extension. Borrower expressly agrees that a Credit Extension made prior to the receipt by Bank

4     CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST   

4.1          Grant of Security
Interest . Borrower hereby grants Bank, to secure the payment and   performance in full of all of the Obligations, a continuing
security interest in, and pledges to Bank, the Collateral, wherever located, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or arising,
and all proceeds and products thereof. 

Borrower acknowledges
that it previously has entered, and/or may in the future enter, into Bank Services Agreements with Bank. Regardless of the terms
of any Bank Services Agreement, Borrower agrees that any amounts Borrower owes Bank thereunder shall be deemed to be Obligations
hereunder and that it is the intent of Borrower and Bank to have all such Obligations secured by the first priority perfected security
interest in the Collateral granted herein (subject only to Permitted Liens that may have superior priority to Bank s Lien
in this Agreement). 

If this
Agreement is terminated, Bank s Lien in the Collateral shall continue until the Obligations (other than inchoate
indemnity obligations) are satisfied in full, and at such time, Bank shall, at Borrower s sole cost and expense,
terminate its security interest in the Collateral and all rights therein shall revert to Borrower. In the event (x) all
Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations), except for Bank Services, are satisfied in full, and (y) this
Agreement is terminated, Bank shall terminate the security interest granted herein upon Borrower providing cash collateral
acceptable to Bank in its good faith business judgment for Bank Services, if any. In the event such Bank Services consist of
outstanding Letters of Credit, Borrower shall provide to Bank cash collateral in an amount equal to (x) if such Letters of
Credit are denominated in Dollars, then at least one hundred five percent (105.0%); and (y) if such Letters of Credit are
denominated in a Foreign Currency, then at least one hundred ten percent (110.0%), of the Dollar Equivalent of the face
amount of all such Letters of Credit plus all interest, fees, and costs due or to become due in connection therewith (as
estimated by Bank in its good faith business judgment), to secure all of the Obligations relating to such Letters of
Credit. 

4.2         Priority
of Security Interest . Borrower represents, warrants, and covenants that the security   interest granted herein is and
shall at all times continue to be a first priority perfected security interest in the Collateral (subject only to Permitted Liens
that are permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to have superior priority to Bank s Lien under this Agreement).
If Borrower shall acquire a commercial tort claim, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank in a writing signed by Borrower of the general
details thereof and grant to Bank in such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of
this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank. 

4.3         Authorization
to File Financing Statements . Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to file financing   statements, without notice to Borrower,
with all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect or protect Bank s interest or rights hereunder, including a notice that any
disposition of the Collateral, by either Borrower or any other Person, shall be deemed to violate the rights of Bank under the
Code. Such financing statements may indicate the Collateral as  all assets of the Debtor except Intellectual Property 
or words of similar effect, or as being of an equal or lesser scope, or with greater detail, all in Bank s discretion. 

5     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   

Borrower represents and warrants as follows: 

5.1         Due Organization,
Authorization; Power and Authority . Borrower is duly existing and in   good standing in its jurisdiction of formation
and is qualified and licensed to do business and is in good standing in any jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or
its ownership of property requires that it be qualified except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on Borrower s business. In connection with this Agreement, Borrower has delivered to Bank a completed
certificate signed by Borrower, entitled  Perfection Certificate . Borrower represents and warrants to Bank that (a)
Borrower s exact legal name is that indicated on the Perfection Certificate and on the signature page hereof; (b) Borrower
is an organization of the type and is organized in the jurisdiction set forth in the Perfection Certificate; (c) the Perfection
Certificate accurately sets forth Borrower s organizational identification number or accurately states that Borrower has
none; (d) the Perfection Certificate accurately sets forth Borrower s place of business, or, if more than one, its chief
executive office as well as Borrower s mailing address (if different than its chief executive office); (e) except as disclosed
in the Perfection Certificate, Borrower (and each of its predecessors) has not, in the past five (5) years, changed its jurisdiction
of formation, organizational structure or type, or any organizational number assigned by its jurisdiction; and (f) all other information
set forth on the Perfection Certificate pertaining to Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is accurate and complete (it being
understood and agreed that Borrower may from time to time update certain information in the Perfection Certificate after the Effective
Date to the extent permitted by one or more specific provisions in this Agreement). If Borrower is not now a Registered Organization
but later becomes one, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of such occurrence and provide Bank with Borrower s organizational
identification number. 

The execution, delivery
and performance by Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized, and do not (i) conflict with
any of Borrower s organizational documents, (ii) contravene, conflict with, constitute a default under or violate any material
Requirement of Law, (iii) contravene, conflict or violate any applicable order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination
or award of any Governmental Authority by which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their property or assets may be bound
or affected, (iv) require any action by, filing, registration, or qualification with, or Governmental Approval from, any Governmental
Authority (except such Governmental Approvals which have already been obtained and are in full force and effect) or (v) conflict
with, contravene, constitute a default or breach under, or result in or permit the termination or acceleration of, any material
agreement by which Borrower is bound. Borrower is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound
in which the default could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower s business. 

5.2         Collateral .
Borrower has good title to, rights in, and the power to transfer each item of the   Collateral upon which it purports to grant
a Lien hereunder, free and clear of any and all Liens except Permitted Liens. Borrower has no Collateral Accounts at or with any
bank or financial institution other than Bank or Bank s Affiliates except for the Collateral Accounts described in the Perfection
Certificate delivered to Bank in connection herewith and which Borrower has taken such actions as are necessary to give Bank a
perfected security interest therein, pursuant to the terms of Section 6.8(b). The Accounts are bona fide, existing obligations
of the Account Debtors. 

The Collateral is not
in the possession of any third party bailee (such as a warehouse) except as otherwise provided in the Perfection Certificate. None
of the components of the Collateral shall be maintained at locations other than as provided in the Perfection Certificate or as
permitted pursuant to Section 7.2. 

Borrower is the sole
owner of the Intellectual Property which it owns or purports to own except for (a) non-exclusive licenses granted to its customers
in the ordinary course of business, (b) over-the-counter software that is commercially available to the public, and (c) material
Intellectual Property licensed to Borrower and noted on the Perfection Certificate. Each Patent which it owns or purports to own
and which is material to Borrower s business is valid and enforceable, and no part of the Intellectual Property which Borrower
owns or purports to own and which is material to Borrower s business has been judged invalid or unenforceable, in whole or
in part. To the best of Borrower s knowledge, no claim has been made that any part of the Intellectual Property violates
the rights of any third party except to the extent such claim would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Borrower s business. 

Except as noted on the Perfection Certificate, Borrower is not
a party to, nor is it bound by, any Restricted License. 

5.3    Accounts Receivable . 

(a)         For
each Account with respect to which Advances are requested, on the date each Advance is requested and made, such Account shall be
an Eligible Account. 

(b)         All
statements made and all unpaid balances appearing in all invoices, instruments and other documents evidencing the Eligible Accounts
are and shall be true and correct and all such invoices, instruments and other documents, and all of Borrower's Books are genuine
and in all respects what they purport to be. All sales and other transactions underlying or giving rise to each Eligible Account
shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations. Borrower has no knowledge
of any actual or imminent Insolvency Proceeding of any Account Debtor whose accounts are Eligible Accounts in any Transaction Report.
To the best of Borrower s knowledge, all signatures and endorsements on all documents, instruments, and agreements relating
to all Eligible Accounts are genuine, and all such documents, instruments and agreements are legally enforceable in accordance
with their terms. 

5.4         Litigation .
There are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of any Responsible   Officer, threatened in writing by or
against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries involving more than, individually or in the aggregate, One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000). 

5.5         Financial
Statements; Financial Condition . All consolidated financial statements for Borrower   and any of its Subsidiaries delivered
to Bank fairly present in all material respects Borrower s consolidated financial condition and Borrower s consolidated
results of operations. There has not been any material deterioration in Borrower s consolidated financial condition since
the date of the most recent financial statements submitted to Bank. 

5.6         Solvency .
The fair salable value of Borrower s consolidated assets (including goodwill minus   disposition costs) exceeds the
fair value of Borrower s liabilities; Borrower is not left with unreasonably small capital after the transactions in this
Agreement; and Borrower is able to pay its debts (including trade debts) as they mature. 

5.7         Regulatory
Compliance . Borrower is not an  investment company  or a company  controlled    by an
 investment company  under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Borrower is not engaged as one of its
important activities in extending credit for margin stock (under Regulations X, T and U of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors). Borrower (a) has complied in all material respects with all Requirements of Law, and
(b) has not violated any Requirements of Law the violation of which
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business. None of Borrower s or any of its
Subsidiaries  properties or assets has been used by Borrower or any Subsidiary or, to the best of Borrower s
knowledge, by previous Persons, in disposing, producing, storing, treating, or transporting any hazardous substance other
than legally. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained all consents, approvals and authorizations of, made all
declarations or filings with, and given all notices to, all Governmental Authorities that are necessary to continue their
respective businesses as currently conducted. 

5.8         Subsidiaries;
Investments . Borrower does not own any stock, partnership, or other ownership   interest or other equity securities except
for Permitted Investments. 

5.9         Tax
Returns and Payments; Pension Contributions . Borrower has timely filed all required tax   returns and reports, and Borrower
has timely paid all foreign, federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions owed by Borrower except (a)
to the extent such taxes are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted,
so long as such reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made
therefor, or (b) if such taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions do not, individually or in the aggregate, exceed Ten Thousand
Dollars ($10,000). 

To the extent Borrower
defers payment of any contested taxes, Borrower shall (i) notify Bank in writing of the commencement of, and any material development
in, the proceedings, and (ii) post bonds or take any other steps required to prevent the Governmental Authority levying such contested
taxes from obtaining a Lien upon any of the Collateral that is other than a  Permitted Lien.  Borrower is unaware of
any claims or adjustments proposed for any of Borrower's prior tax years which could result in additional taxes becoming due and
payable by Borrower in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000). Borrower has paid all amounts necessary to fund all present pension,
profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not withdrawn from participation
in, and has not permitted partial or complete termination of, or permitted the occurrence of any other event with respect to, any
such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation or its successors or any other governmental agency. 

5.10        Use of Proceeds .
Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Credit Extensions solely as working   capital and to fund its general business requirements
and not for personal, family, household or agricultural purposes. 

5.11        Full
Disclosure . No written representation, warranty or other statement of Borrower in any   certificate or written statement
given to Bank, as of the date such representation, warranty, or other statement was made, taken together with all such written
certificates and written statements given to Bank, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements contained in the certificates or statements not misleading (it being recognized by Bank that
the projections and forecasts provided by Borrower in good faith and based upon reasonable assumptions are not viewed as facts
and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such projections and forecasts may differ from the projected or
forecasted results). 

5.12        Definition
of  Knowledge .    For purposes of the Loan Documents, whenever a representation or   warranty is made
to Borrower s knowledge or awareness, to the  best of  Borrower s knowledge, or with a similar qualification,
knowledge or awareness means the actual knowledge, after reasonable investigation, of any Responsible Officer.

(a)         Maintain

all laws, ordinances and regulations to which it is subject.

extent any such documents are included in materials otherwise filed with the SEC) may be delivered electronically and if so delivered,
shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which Borrower posts such documents, or provides a link thereto, on Borrower s
website on the Internet at Borrower s website address; provided, however, Borrower shall notify Bank in the monthly Compliance
Certificate of the posting of any such documents;

(a)          Schedules
and Documents Relating to Accounts  .  Borrower shall deliver to Bank transaction reports and schedules of
collections, as provided in Section 6.2, on Bank s standard forms; provided, however, that Borrower s failure to execute
and deliver the same shall not affect or limit Bank s Lien and other rights in all of Borrower s Accounts, nor shall
Bank s failure to advance or lend against a specific Account affect or limit Bank s Lien and other rights therein.
If requested by Bank, Borrower shall furnish Bank with copies (or, at Bank s request, originals) of all contracts, orders,
invoices, and other similar documents, and all shipping instructions, delivery receipts, bills of lading, and other evidence of
delivery, for any goods the sale or disposition of which gave rise to such Accounts. In addition, Borrower shall deliver to Bank,
on its request, the originals of all instruments, chattel paper, security agreements, guarantees and other documents and property
evidencing or securing any Accounts, in the same form as received, with all necessary endorsements, and copies of all credit memos. 

(b)          Disputes .
Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of all disputes or claims relating to Accounts. Borrower may forgive (completely or
partially), compromise, or settle any Account for less than payment in full, or agree to do any of the foregoing so long as (i)
Borrower does so in good faith, in a commercially reasonable manner, in the ordinary course of business, in arm s-length
transactions, and reports the same to Bank in the regular reports provided to Bank; (ii) no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; and (iii) after taking into account all such discounts, settlements and forgiveness, the total outstanding Advances
will not exceed the lesser of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base. 

(c)          Reserved . 

(d)          Returns  .
 Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, if any Account Debtor returns any Inventory to Borrower, Borrower
shall promptly (i) determine the reason for such return, (ii) issue a credit memorandum to the Account Debtor in the appropriate
amount, and (iii) provide a copy of such credit memorandum to Bank, upon request from Bank. In the event any attempted return
occurs after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Borrower shall immediately notify Bank of the
return of the Inventory. 

(e)          Verification  .  Bank may, from time to time, verify directly with the respective Account Debtors the validity, amount and other matters
relating to the Accounts, either in the name of Borrower or Bank or such other name as Bank may choose, and notify any Account
Debtor of Bank s security interest in such Account. 

(f)          No
Liability  .  Bank shall not be responsible or liable for any shortage or discrepancy in, damage to, or loss
or destruction of, any goods, the sale or other disposition of which gives rise to an Account, or for any error, act, omission,
or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, failure to settle, collection or failure to collect any Account, or for settling
any Account in good faith for less than the full amount thereof, nor shall Bank be deemed to be responsible for any of Borrower's
obligations under any contract or agreement giving rise to an Account. Nothing herein shall, however, relieve Bank from liability
for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

6.4         Remittance
of Proceeds . Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6, deliver, in kind, all   proceeds arising from the disposition
of any Collateral to Bank in the original form in which received by Borrower not later than the following Business Day after receipt
by Borrower, to be applied to the Obligations (1) prior to an Event of Default, pursuant to the terms of Section 2.5(b) hereof,
and (2) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof; provided
that, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not be obligated to remit to Bank the proceeds of the
sale of surplus, worn out or obsolete Equipment disposed of by Borrower in good faith in an arm s length transaction for
an aggregate purchase price of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) or less (for all such transactions in any fiscal year). Borrower
agrees that it will maintain all proceeds of Collateral in an account maintained with Bank. Nothing in this Section limits the
restrictions on disposition of Collateral set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 

6.5         Taxes;
Pensions . Timely file, and require each of its Subsidiaries to timely file, all required tax   returns and reports and
timely pay, and require each of its Subsidiaries to timely pay, all foreign, federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits
and contributions owed by Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries, except for deferred payment of any taxes contested pursuant to
the terms of Section 5.9 hereof, and shall deliver to Bank, on demand, appropriate certificates attesting to such payments, and
pay all amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their
terms. 

6.6         Access
to Collateral; Books and Records . At reasonable times, on one (1) Business Day s   notice (provided no notice
is required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), Bank, or its agents, shall have the right to inspect the
Collateral and the right to audit and copy Borrower s Books. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be conducted at
Borrower s expense and no more often than once every fiscal year (or more frequently as conditions may warrant) unless
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in which case such inspections and audits shall occur as often as Bank
shall determine is necessary. The charge therefor shall be $1,000 per person per day (or such higher amount as shall
represent Bank s then-current standard charge for the same), plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In the event
Borrower and Bank schedule an audit more than ten (10) days in advance,
and Borrower cancels or seeks to reschedules the audit with less than ten (10) days written notice to Bank, then
(without limiting any of Bank s rights or remedies), Borrower shall pay Bank a fee of $1,000 plus any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Bank to compensate Bank for the anticipated costs and expenses of the cancellation or rescheduling. 

(a)         Keep
its business and the Collateral insured for risks and in amounts standard for companies in Borrower s industry and location
and as Bank may reasonably request. Insurance policies shall be in a form, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies
that are not Affiliates of Borrower, and in amounts that are satisfactory to Bank. All property policies shall have a lender s
loss payable endorsement showing Bank as lender loss payee. All liability policies shall show, or have endorsements showing, Bank
as an additional insured. Bank shall be named as lender loss payee and/or additional insured with respect to any such insurance
providing coverage in respect of any Collateral. 

(b)         Ensure
that proceeds payable under any property policy are, at Bank s option, payable to Bank on account of the Obligations. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall have the option of applying the
proceeds of any casualty policy up to One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate for all losses under all casualty
policies in any one year, toward the replacement or repair of destroyed or damaged property; provided that any such replaced or
repaired property (A) shall be of equal or like value as the replaced or repaired Collateral and (B) shall be deemed Collateral
in which Bank has been granted a first priority security interest, and (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, all proceeds payable under such casualty policy shall, at the option of Bank, be payable to Bank on account
of the Obligations. 

(c)         At
Bank s request, Borrower shall deliver certified copies of insurance policies and evidence of all premium payments. Each

however, that if the default cannot by its nature be cured within the ten (10) day period or cannot after diligent attempts by
Borrower be cured within such ten (10) day period, and such default is likely to be cured within a reasonable time, then Borrower
shall have an additional period (which shall not in any case exceed thirty (30) days) to attempt to cure such default, and within
such reasonable time period the failure to cure the default shall not be deemed an Event of Default (but no Credit Extensions shall

and such revocation, rescission, suspension, modification or non-renewal could reasonably be expected to affect the status of or

9     BANK S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES   

9.1          Rights and Remedies .
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,   Bank may, without notice or demand, do any or all
of the following: 

(a)         declare
all Obligations immediately due and payable (but if an Event of Default described in Section 8.5 occurs all Obligations are immediately
due and payable without any action by Bank); 

(b)         stop
advancing money or extending credit for Borrower s benefit under this Agreement or under any other agreement between Borrower
and Bank; 

(c)         for
any Letters of Credit, demand that Borrower (i) deposit cash with Bank in an amount equal to (x) if such Letters of Credit are
denominated in Dollars, then at least one hundred five percent (105.0%); and (y) if such Letters of Credit are denominated in a
Foreign Currency, then at least one hundred ten percent (110.0%), of the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate face amount of all
Letters of Credit remaining undrawn (plus all interest, fees, and costs due or to become due in connection therewith (as estimated
by Bank in its good faith business judgment)), to secure all of the Obligations relating to such Letters of Credit, as collateral
security for the repayment of any future drawings under such Letters of Credit, and Borrower shall forthwith deposit and pay such
amounts, and (ii) pay in advance all letter of credit fees scheduled to be paid or payable over the remaining term of any Letters
of Credit; 

(d)         terminate
any FX Contracts; 

(e)         verify
the amount of, demand payment of and performance under, and collect any Accounts and General Intangibles, settle or adjust disputes
and claims directly with Account Debtors for amounts on terms and in any order that Bank considers advisable, and notify any Person
owing Borrower money of Bank s security interest in such funds; 

(f)         make
any payments and do any acts it considers necessary or reasonable to protect the Collateral and/or its security interest in the
Collateral. Borrower shall assemble the Collateral if Bank requests and make it available as Bank designates. Bank may enter premises
where the Collateral is located, take and maintain possession of any part of the Collateral, and pay, purchase, contest, or compromise
any Lien which appears to be prior or superior to its security interest and pay all expenses incurred. Borrower grants Bank a license
to enter and occupy any of its premises, without charge, to exercise any of Bank s rights or remedies; 

(g)         apply
to the Obligations (i) any balances and deposits of Borrower it holds, or (ii) any amount held by Bank owing to or for the credit
or the account of Borrower; 

(h)         ship,
reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell the Collateral. Bank is hereby
granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Borrower s labels, Patents, Copyrights,
mask works, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names, Trademarks, and advertising matter, or any similar property
as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection
with Bank s exercise of its rights under this Section, Borrower s rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements
inure to Bank s benefit; 

(i)         place
a  hold  on any account maintained with Bank and/or deliver a notice of exclusive control, any entitlement order, or
other directions or instructions pursuant to any Control Agreement or similar agreements providing control of any Collateral; 

(j)         demand
and receive possession of Borrower s Books; and 

(k)         exercise
all rights and remedies available to Bank under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the
Code (including disposal of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof). 

9.2         Power
of Attorney . Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact,   exercisable upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to: (a) endorse Borrower s name on any checks or other forms of payment
or security; (b) sign Borrower s name on any invoice or bill of lading for any Account or drafts against Account Debtors;
(c) settle and adjust disputes and claims about the Accounts directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and on terms Bank determines
reasonable; (d) make, settle, and adjust all claims under Borrower s insurance policies; (e) pay, contest or settle any Lien,
charge, encumbrance, security interest, and adverse claim in or to the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise
take any action to terminate or discharge the same; and (f) transfer the Collateral into the name of Bank or a third party as the
Code permits. Borrower hereby appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact to sign Borrower s name on any documents necessary
to perfect or continue the perfection of Bank s security interest in the Collateral regardless of whether an Event of Default
has occurred until all Obligations have been satisfied in full and Bank is under no further obligation to make Credit Extensions
hereunder. Bank s foregoing appointment as Borrower s attorney in fact, and all of Bank s rights and powers,
coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until all Obligations have been fully repaid and performed and Bank s obligation
to provide Credit Extensions terminates. 

9.3         Protective
Payments . If Borrower fails to obtain the insurance called for by Section 6.7 or fails   to pay any premium thereon or
fails to pay any other amount which Borrower is obligated to pay under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or which may be
required to preserve the Collateral, Bank may obtain such insurance or make such payment, and all amounts so paid by Bank are Bank
Expenses and immediately due and payable, bearing interest at the then highest rate applicable to the Obligations, and secured
by the Collateral. Bank will make reasonable efforts to provide Borrower with notice of Bank obtaining such insurance at the time
it is obtained or within a reasonable time thereafter. No payments by Bank are deemed an agreement to make similar payments in
the future or Bank s waiver of any Event of Default. 

9.4         Application
of Payments and Proceeds . If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,   Bank shall have the right to apply
in any order any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances, payments, proceeds realized as the result of
any collection of Accounts or other disposition of the Collateral, or otherwise, to the Obligations. Bank shall pay any surplus
to Borrower by credit to the Designated Deposit Account or to other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable
to Bank for any deficiency. If Bank, directly or indirectly, enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any
purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Bank shall have the option, exercisable at any time, of either reducing the Obligations by
the principal amount of the purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by Bank of cash
therefor. 

9.5         Bank s
Liability for Collateral . So long as Bank complies with reasonable banking practices   regarding the safekeeping of the
Collateral in the possession or under the control of Bank, Bank shall not be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of
the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage to the Collateral; (c) any diminution in the value of the Collateral; or (d) any act or
default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, or other Person. Borrower bears all risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Collateral. 

9.6         No
Waiver; Remedies Cumulative . Bank s failure, at any time or times, to require strict   performance by Borrower of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of Bank thereafter to
demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by the party
granting the waiver and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it is given. Bank s rights
and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Bank has all rights and remedies provided under
the Code, by law, or in equity. Bank s exercise of one right or remedy is not an election and shall not preclude Bank from
exercising any other remedy under this Agreement or other remedy available at law or in equity, and Bank s waiver of any
Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Bank s delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence. 

9.7         Demand Waiver .
Borrower waives demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and   nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment
at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees
held by Bank on which Borrower is liable. 

All notices, consents,
requests, approvals, demands, or other communication by any party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document must be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given, or delivered: (a) upon the earlier of actual receipt and three (3) Business
Days after deposit in the U.S. mail, first class, registered or certified mail return receipt requested, with proper postage prepaid;
(b) upon transmission, when sent by electronic mail; (c) one (1) Business Day after deposit with a reputable overnight courier
with all charges prepaid; or (d) when delivered, if hand-delivered by messenger, all of which shall be addressed to the party to
be notified and sent to the address or email address indicated below. Bank or Borrower may change its mailing or electronic mail
address by giving the other party written notice thereof in accordance with the terms of this Section 10. 

11     CHOICE OF LAW, VENUE, JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND JUDICIAL
REFERENCE   

Except as otherwise
expressly provided in any of the Loan Documents, Virginia law governs the Loan Documents without regard to principles of conflicts
of law. Borrower and Bank each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in Virginia; provided, however,
that if for any reason Bank cannot avail itself of such courts in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Borrower accepts jurisdiction of
the courts and venue in Santa Clara County, California. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, BANK SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING AGAINST BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHICH BANK DEEMS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE
TO REALIZE ON THE COLLATERAL OR TO OTHERWISE ENFORCE BANK S RIGHTS AGAINST BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTY. Borrower expressly submits
and consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in any such court, and Borrower hereby waives any
objection that it may have based upon lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non conveniens and hereby consents
to the granting of such legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by such court. Borrower hereby waives personal service
of the summons, complaints, and other process issued in such action or suit and agrees that service of such summons, complaints,
and other process may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to Borrower at the address set forth in, or subsequently
provided by Borrower in accordance with, Section 10 of this Agreement and that service so made shall be deemed completed upon the
earlier to occur of Borrower s actual receipt thereof or three (3) days after deposit in the U.S. mails, proper postage prepaid. 

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER AND BANK EACH WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT
OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY AND
ALL OTHER CLAIMS. THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR BOTH PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS COUNSEL . 

This Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

12.1        Termination
Prior to Revolving Line Maturity Date; Survival . All covenants, representations   and warranties made in this Agreement
continue in full force until this Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms and all Obligations have been satisfied. So long
as Borrower has satisfied the Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations, any other obligations which, by their terms,
are to survive the termination of this Agreement, and any Obligations under Bank Services Agreements that are cash collateralized

insurance shall be with a Best s A+ rated company licensed to transact business in the State of Florida. Landlord shall be named
as an additional insured under Tenant s insurance, and such insurance shall be primary and non-contributing with any insurance

employees, licensees, invitees, third persons in or about the Premises. In case Landlord shall be made a party to any litigation
commenced by or against Tenant, then Tenant shall protect and hold Landlord harmless and shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable
attorney s fees incurred or paid by Landlord in connection with such litigation. In addition, Tenant, as a material part
of the consideration to be rendered to Landlord, hereby waives all claims against Landlord for personal injury or death, property
damage or other loss to Tenant, its agents, employees, licensees, invitees or third persons in or about the Premises and the Land
from any cause, except Landlord s gross negligence, arising at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
  Section  , the amounts of insurance required of Tenant shall not be construed in any manner whatsoever so as to limit
Tenant s liability hereunder and Tenant s indemnification and holding harmless of Landlord shall survive the termination
of this Lease. 

11.          WAIVER
OF SUBROGATION . Tenant and Landlord release each other and waive any right of recovery against each other for loss or damage
to their respective property, which occurs on or about the Premises (whether due to the negligence of either party, their agents,
employees, licensees, invitees or otherwise), to the extent that such loss or damage is reimbursed by insurance proceeds. Tenant
and Landlord agree that all policies of insurance obtained by either of them in connection with the Premises shall contain appropriate
waiver of subrogation clauses. 

12.          REPAIRS .

of receipt of an invoice from Landlord. 

13.          TENANT S
PROPERTY . Furnishings, trade fixtures and equipment installed by Tenant shall be the property of Tenant. On expiration of the
Term, if there is then no Event of Default, Tenant may remove any such property and shall repair the Premises to the same condition
as when the Term commenced, ordinary wear and tear accepted, or reimburse Landlord for the cost of so repairing the Premises. If
Tenant fails to remove such property as required under this Lease, Landlord may do so and keep and use or dispose of the same in
its sole discretion without any liability to Tenant on account thereof, and further may charge the cost of any such removal, storage
or disposition to Tenant.

14.          ALTERATIONS
BY TENANT . Tenant shall not cut, drill into, disfigure, deface, or injure any part of the Premises, nor obstruct or permit
any obstruction, alteration, addition, or installation in the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord. All alterations,
additions or installations, including but not limited to partitions, air conditioning ducts or equipment (except movable furniture
and fixtures put in at the expense of Tenant and removable without defacing or injuring the Building or the Premises), shall become
the property of Landlord at the expiration or any earlier termination of the Term. Landlord, however, reserves the option to require
Tenant, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, upon notice, to remove all fixtures, alterations, additions, decorations or installations
(including those not removable without defacing or injuring the Premises) and to restore the Premises to the same condition as
when originally leased to Tenant, reasonable wear and tear excepted. All work performed by Tenant shall be done: (a) in a good
and workmanlike manner, (b) with materials of the quality and appearance comparable to those in the Building, (c) in compliance

of worker s compensation insurance covering all persons employed for such work and with respect to whom death or bodily injury
claims could be asserted against Landlord, Tenant, or the Premises. 

15.          ASSIGNMENT:
SUBLETTING . The identity and financial position of the Tenant is a material consideration of Landlord entering into this Lease.
Tenant shall not, directly or indirectly, assign or sublet under this Lease or any part thereof, nor permit all or any part of
the Premises to be used or occupied by another, without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord. Any assignment or subletting
made without such Landlord s consent, shall be voidable by Landlord. Any consent by Landlord, unless specifically stated therein,
shall not relieve Tenant from its obligations under this Lease. To be effective, any assignment or sublease must be in writing
and signed by the Landlord, Tenant and assignee/subtenant, and shall set forth the entire consideration being given and received.
The acceptance of Rent from any other person shall neither be deemed to be a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease nor
be deemed to be a consent to the assignment of this Lease or subletting of the Premises. If Landlord shall consent to any assignment
or subletting, the assignee/subtenant shall assume all obligations of Tenant hereunder and neither Tenant nor any assignee/subtenant
shall be relieved of any liability hereunder in the performance of any of the terms, covenants and conditions hereof. In the event
Tenant shall request the consent of Landlord to any assignment or subletting of this Lease, Tenant shall pay, as Additional Rent,
all of Landlord s administrative costs, overhead, reasonable attorneys  fees and processing costs incurred by Landlord in connection
therewith regardless of whether or not Landlord consents to any such assignment or subletting. Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the acceptance of such fees by Landlord shall not constitute a consent by Landlord to the proposed assignment, transfer or
sublease. 

16.          LIENS .
Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall never, under any circumstances, have the power to subject
the interest of Landlord in the Premises or Building to any mechanics  or materialmen s liens or liens of any kind
nor shall any provision in this Lease ever be construed as empowering Tenant to encumber or cause Tenant to encumber the title
or interest of Landlord in the Premises or Building. In order to comply with the provisions of   Section  713. 10 Florida
Statutes, it is specifically provided that neither Tenant nor anyone claiming by, through or under Tenant, including but not limited
to contractors, subcontractors, materialmen, mechanics and laborers, shall have any right to file or place any kind of lien whatsoever
upon the Premises or Building or any improvement thereon, and any such liens are specifically prohibited. All parties with whom
Tenant may deal are put on notice that Tenant has no power to subject Landlord s interest to any claim or lien of any kind
or character, and all such persons so dealing with Tenant must look solely to the credit of Tenant, and not to Landlord s
interest or assets. Tenant shall put all such parties with whom Tenant may deal on notice of the terms of this   Section  .
If at any time a lien or encumbrance is filed against the Premises or Building as a result of Tenant s work, materials or
obligations, Tenant shall promptly discharge said lien or encumbrance, and if said lien or encumbrance has not been removed within
ten (10) days from the date it is filed, Tenant agrees to deposit with Landlord cash in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of the amount of any such lien or encumbrance, to be held by Landlord (without interest to Tenant, except as may be required
by law) until any such lien or encumbrance is discharged.

any time during the Term there is Partial Damage, Landlord may, at Landlord s option, either (i) repair such damage, in
which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or (ii) give written notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days
after the date of the occurrence of such damage of Landlord s intention to terminate this Lease, which termination shall
be effective as of the date of the occurrence of such damage.

17.2          Total
Destruction :  Total Destruction  means damage or destruction to the Premises to the extent that the cost of
repair is fifty percent (50%) or more of the fair market value of the Premises immediately prior to such damage or
destruction. If at any time during the Term there is a Total Destruction, Landlord may, at Landlord s option, either (i)
repair such damage in which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or (ii) either Landlord or Tenant may
terminate this Lease as of the date of such Total Destruction. 

17.3          Abatement
of Rent : If Landlord repairs or restores the Premises pursuant to the provisions of this  Section,  the Rent payable hereunder
for the period during which such damage, repair or restoration continues shall be abated in proportion to the degree to which Tenant s
use of the Premises is impaired. Except for abatement of Rent, if any, Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord as a result
of any such damage. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement
of Rent if such damage is in any way caused by Tenant. 

18.          CONDEMNATION .
If all or any part of the Premises shall be taken under power of eminent domain or like power, or sold under imminent threat thereof
to any public authority or private entity having such power, this Lease shall terminate as to the part of the Premises so taken
or sold, effective as of the date possession is required to be delivered to such authority or entity. Rent for the remaining Term
shall be reduced in the proportion that the Premises is reduced by the taking. If a partial taking or sale of the Premises (i)
reduces the size of the Premises by more than twenty percent (20%), or (ii) renders the Building commercially unviable to Landlord
(in Landlord s sole discretion), Tenant in the case of (i), or Landlord in the case of (ii), may terminate this Lease by notice
to the other party within thirty (30) days after the terminating party receives written notice of the portion to be taken or sold,
such termination to be effective one hundred and eighty (180) days after notice thereof, or when the portion is taken or sold,
whichever is sooner. All condemnation awards and similar payments shall be paid and belong to Landlord, except any amounts awarded
or paid specifically for Tenant s trade fixtures and relocation costs (provided such awards do not reduce Landlord s award). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all leasehold interest awards shall belong to and be paid to Landlord, and Tenant shall
execute any assignment or other documentation requested by Landlord to effectuate such award or payment. 

19.          ACCESS .
Upon reasonable notice, except in the case of an emergency, Landlord shall be permitted to enter the Premises at all reasonable
times with reasonable notice for the purposes of inspecting, repairing and leasing the Premises and of ascertaining compliance
by Tenant with the provisions of this Lease. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts so as to minimize any inconvenience to or disruption
of Tenant. Landlord may show the Premises to prospective purchasers, mortgagees, or tenants at any time.

by law or in equity. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an  Event of Default  under this Lease by
Tenant: (i) Tenant shall fail to make payment of any monthly installment of Rent, Additional Rent, or any other charges hereunder
in the amount as herein provided within five (5) days from the date any such payment is due; (ii) Tenant shall violate or fail
to perform any of the other terms, covenants or conditions herein made by Tenant, and such violation or failure shall continue
for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Tenant by Landlord or, if such violation or failure shall reasonably
require longer than thirty (30) days to cure, if Tenant shall fail to commence to cure same within thirty (30) days after receipt
of notice thereof and continuously prosecute the curing of the same to completion with due diligence; (iii) Tenant shall make a
general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or shall file or have filed involuntarily against Tenant, a petition for bankruptcy
or other reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief; (iv) a proceeding is filed against Tenant seeking any relief
mentioned in (iii) above and said proceeding is not discharged within forty-five (45) days of the filing thereof; (v) a trustee,
receiver or liquidator shall be appointed for Tenant on a substantial part of its property; or (vi) Tenant shall mortgage, assign
or otherwise encumber its leasehold interest other than as specifically permitted under this Lease. 

21.2         Notwithstanding
the aforementioned, Landlord, in its sole discretion, may, at any time after Tenant s default or violation of any term, covenant
or condition contained herein: 

21.3         Declare
the entire balance of all forms of Rent and Additional Rent due under this Lease for the remainder of the Term to be due and payable
and may collect the then present value of the same (calculated using a discount equal to the yield then obtainable from the United
States Treasury Bill or Note with a maturity date closest to the date of expiration of the Term) by distress or otherwise; 

21.3.1           Apply
the Deposit against the balance of all forms of Rent and Additional Rent due under this Lease; 

5   

21.3.2           Terminate Tenant s right
to occupy the Premises; 

21.4         Enter
the Premises and re-let the same or any part of the Premises in the name of Landlord, or otherwise, as Tenant s agent, for
a term shorter or longer than the balance of the Term, and may grant concessions or free rent in connection therewith, thereby
terminating Tenant s right to possess the Premises, without terminating Tenant s obligations to pay the entire balance of
all forms of Rent and Additional Rent for the remainder of the Term, plus repairs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
the expenses of obtaining possession, brokerage expenses, tenant work modifications, legal fees, and decorating expenses) in connection
therewith. Landlord shall have no obligation to re-let the Premises, and its failure to do so, or failure to collect rent on re-letting,
shall not affect Tenant s liability under this Lease. In no event shall Tenant be entitled to a credit or repayment for re-rental
income which is payable by Tenant under this Lease or which covers a period after the original term of this Lease; and/or 

21.4.1           Terminate
this Lease and any right of renewal and retake possession of the Premises. 

21.5         Any
and all property which may be removed from the Premises by Landlord, pursuant to the authority of this Lease or of law, to which
Tenant is or may be entitled, may be handled, removed or stored by Landlord at the sole risk, cost and expense of Tenant, and Landlord
shall in no event be responsible for the value, preservation or safekeeping thereof. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon demand,
any and all expenses incurred in such removal and all storage charges against such property. Any such property of Tenant not removed
from the Premises or retaken from storage by Tenant within thirty (30) days after the end of the Term or of Tenant s right to possession
of the Premises, however terminated, shall be conclusively deemed to have been forever abandoned by Tenant and may cither be retained
by Landlord as its property or may be disposed of in such manner as Landlord may see fit in its sole discretion. 

21.6         Tenant
agrees, that if it shall at any time, fail to make any payment or perform any other act on its part to be made or performed under
this Lease, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, and after reasonable notice or demand and without waiving, or releasing
Tenant from any obligation under this Lease, make such payment or perform such other act to the extent Landlord, in its sole discretion,
may deem desirable, and in connection therewith, to pay expenses and employ counsel. All sums so paid by Landlord and all expenses
in connection therewith, together with interest thereon at the highest rate of interest per annum allowed by law from the date
of payment, shall be deemed Additional Rent hereunder and payable at the time of the next installment of Rent thereafter becoming
due and Landlord shall have the same rights and remedies for the non-payment thereof, or of any other Additional Rent, as in the
case of default in the payment of Rent. 

21.7         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if Landlord elects to terminate this Lease as a result of any of the contingencies
specified in this   Section,   Landlord shall forthwith, upon such termination, be immediately entitled to recover as
damages, and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the Rent and Additional Rent provided in this Lease for the residue of the Term. 

21.8         If
any of Tenant s checks for Rent are dishonored by Tenant s bank, the amount due shall be subject to Late Charges as outlined
in Section 3.1. In addition thereto, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a service charge covering administrative expenses relating hereto
in the amount of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per such check. If during the Term more than two (2) of Tenant s checks are so dishonored
by Tenant s bank, then Landlord, in its sole discretion, may require all future Rent of Tenant to be paid by cashiers check or
money order only. 

21.9         In
addition to the Late Charge, any payments required to be made by Tenant under the provisions of this Lease not made by Tenant
when and as due shall, from the date when the particular amount became due to the date of payment thereof to Landlord, bear interest
at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum   or the maximum lawful rate of interest allowed by law (whichever is lower).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant does not intend or expect to pay, nor does Landlord expect to charge,
accept, or collect any Rent, Late Charge or interest which collectively would be greater than the highest legal rate of interest
which may be charged under the laws of the State of Florida. 

21.10         In
the event of a breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, Landlord
shall have the right of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if re-entry, summary
proceedings and other remedies were not herein provided for. Mention in this Lease of any particular remedy shall not
preclude Landlord from any other remedy, in law or in equity. Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption
granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant s being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in
the event of Landlord s obtaining possession of the Premises, by reason of the violation by Tenant of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Lease or otherwise; and further expressly waives service of any notice of Landlord s
intention to re-enter. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, Tenant shall pay all and singular the costs, charges, expenses,
and attorneys  fees, reasonably incurred or paid at any time by Landlord, including initial collection efforts and continuing
through all litigation, appeals and any post-judgment execution efforts until fully satisfied, because of the failure of
Tenant to perform, comply with and abide by each and every of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. 

6   

21.11         Tenant
agrees that, in exchange for the promises made in the Lease and other good an valuable consideration received from Landlord, in
the event Tenant files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or is subject to an involuntary bankruptcy, Landlord shall not be subject
to the provisions of U.S.C. Statute 362, and shall automatically and immediately be entitled to relief from the stay imposed thereby
without necessity of further action or court approval. 

22.          QUIET
ENJOYMENT . If and so long as Tenant pays all Rent and keeps and performs each and every term, covenant and condition herein
contained on the part of Tenant to be kept and performed, Tenant shall quietly enjoy the Premises without hindrance by Landlord. 

23.          HOLDOVER
TENANCY . If Tenant shall hold over after the expiration of the Term, at Landlord s option, Tenant may be deemed to be occupying
the Premises as a tenant from month to month, which tenancy may be terminated by fifteen (15) days notice. During such tenancy,
Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, monthly in advance, Rent in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly
installment of Rent which was payable on the last day of the Term, unless a different rate is agreed upon, and to be bound by all
of the terms, covenants and conditions herein specified. If Landlord re-lets the Premises (or any portion(s) thereof) to a new
tenant and the term of such new lease commences during the period for which Tenant holds over, Landlord shall be entitled to recover
from Tenant any and all costs, legal expenses, attorney s fees, damages, loss of profits or any other expenses incurred by Landlord
as a result of Tenant s failure or inability to deliver possession of the Premises to Landlord when required under this Lease. 

24.          AMENDMENT;
WAIVER; APPROVAL; CONSENT . This Lease constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. This Lease shall not be amended
or modified except in writing signed by both parties. Failure of Landlord to exercise any of its rights in one or more instances
shall not be construed as a waiver of Landlord s right to strict performance of such rights or as to any subsequent breach of any

Premises, or any subtenant or assignee of this Lease. 

30.          ACCORD
AND SATISFACTION . No receipt and retention by Landlord of any payment tendered by Tenant in connection with this Lease shall
give rise to or support or constitute an accord or satisfaction, or a compromise or other settlement, notwithstanding any accompanying
statement, instruction or other assertion to the contrary (whether by notation on a check or in a transmittal letter or otherwise),
unless Landlord expressly agrees to an accord and satisfaction, or a compromise or other settlement, in a separate writing duly
executed by Landlord. Landlord may receive and retain, absolutely and for itself, any and all payments so tendered, notwithstanding
any accompanying instructions by Tenant to the contrary. Landlord will be entitled to treat any such payments as being received
on account of any item or items of Rent, interest, expense or damage due in connection therewith, in such amounts and in such order
as Landlord may determine in its sole discretion.

term, covenant and condition never had been contained herein,

the Premises (or any portion(s) thereof), and to all advances made or hereafter to be made upon the security thereof and all renewals,
