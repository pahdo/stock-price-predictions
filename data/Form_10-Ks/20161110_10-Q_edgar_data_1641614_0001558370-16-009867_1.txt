1. Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Business Overview 

CPI Card Group Inc. (which, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as  CPI  or the  Company ) is a leading provider of comprehensive Financial Payment Card solutions in North America. The Company defines Financial Payment Cards as credit, debit and prepaid debit cards issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) and Interac (in Canada). The Company serves its customers through a network of ten production and card services facilities, including eight high-security facilities in North America that are each certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada) and, where required by the Company s customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the Payment Card Industry ( PCI ) Security Standards Council. In addition to its eight North American facilities, the Company has two facilities in the United Kingdom that produce retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards that are not issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, and personalization services. 

Basis of Presentation 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for the fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the audited financial statements as of that date.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

The Company sold its non-secure operation located in Nevada on January 12, 2015 (the  Nevada Sale ) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement for $5,000 in cash. The Nevada operations primarily produced retail gift cards that are not issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands.  See Note 2,  Discontinued Operation and Disposition.  

In August 2015, the Company completed its shut-down and closure of its operation in Petersfield, United Kingdom.  Petersfield primarily produced retail gift cards that are not issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands.  Accordingly, the Company accrued facility contract termination costs of $681 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Use of Estimates 

Management uses estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities in its preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets; valuation allowances for inventories and deferred tax assets; debt; and stock-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , in May 2014, as amended by ASU 2016-12   Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   in May 2016. ASU 2014-09, as amended, requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty

of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those periods. The Company plans to implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09, as amended, as of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or using the cumulative effect transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application.  The Company has not determined what transition method it will use.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that the future adoption of ASU 2014-09, as amended, may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements by analyzing its current portfolio of customer contracts, including a review of historical accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences in applying the new guidance.   

The FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory     Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , in July 2015.  ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The new standard is effective for public entities  annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company plans to implement the provisions of ASU 2015-11 as of January 1, 2017. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2015-11 on its results of operations, financial position and consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which provides guidance for accounting for leases. The new guidance requires companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (the Company s fiscal year 2019) with early adoption permitted. The new standard is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its results of operations, financial position and consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation:     Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share based payment transactions, including the accounting for forfeitures, statutory withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows.  In addition, excess tax benefits recorded to equity under existing accounting guidance will be recognized in income tax expense under the new standard. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (the Company s fiscal year 2017), with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its results of operations, financial position and consolidated financial statements.  

2. Discontinued Operation and Disposition 

On January 12, 2015, the Company sold its Nevada non-secure operations pursuant to an asset purchase agreement for $5,000 in cash. The net carrying values of the assets sold as part of the discontinued operation included inventory and plant, equipment and leasehold improvements of $3,129 and $2,910, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of a discontinued operation of $887, which is included in the gain from a discontinued operation, net of an income tax benefit of $1,926 in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

The Nevada operations recognized a loss of $606 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net of an income tax benefit of $404. 

After the Nevada sale, CPI retained no significant continuing involvement in the Nevada operations other than a 180 day transition of services agreement, which expired on July 11, 2015. The Nevada operations had $32,128 of tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets, of which $4,190 of the tax deductible goodwill resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of $1,510 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

There was no recorded activity related to this transaction during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

3. Inventories 

Inventories are summarized below:

4. Plant, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements 

Plant, equipment and leasehold improvements consist of the following: 

For the Company s continuing operations, amounts recorded for the depreciation of plant, equipment and leasehold improvements was $3,098 and $2,673 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $9,124 and $8,424 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill of $72,339 at September 30, 2016 is attributable to the Company s segments as follows: U.S. Debit and Credit $64,330; U.K. Limited $6,211; and Other $1,798. The change in goodwill from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 was a result of foreign currency translation adjustments, primarily in the U.K. Limited segment. 

Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, technology and software, non-compete agreements, favorable leases and trademarks. Total intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average useful life of 16 years. The changes in the cost basis of the intangibles from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 are related to foreign currency translations. Intangible amortization expense was $1,132 and $1,145 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Intangible amortization expense was $3,406 and $3,433 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, intangible assets, excluding goodwill, were comprised of the following:

The estimated future aggregate amortization expense for the identified amortizable intangibles noted above as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). In determining fair value, the Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.     

Level 2  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term for the assets or liabilities.     

Level 3  Valuations based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.     

The Company s financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements and the necessary disclosures are as follows:

7. Long-Term Debt and Credit Facility 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, long-term debt and credit facilities consist of the following: 

First Lien Credit Facility 

On August 17, 2015, the Company entered into a first lien credit agreement (the  First Lien Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of lenders providing for a $435,000 first lien term loan facility (the  First Lien Term Loan ) and a $40,000 revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ). The First Lien Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility have maturity dates of August 17, 2022 and August 17, 2020, respectively. 

The First Lien Credit Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets constituting equipment, inventory, receivables, cash and other tangible and intangible property. 

Interest rates under the First Lien Credit Facility are based, at the Company s election, on a Eurodollar rate, subject to an interest rate floor of 1.0%, plus a margin of 4.50%, or a base rate plus a margin of 3.50%. Letters of credit are subject to a 0.125% fronting fee payable to the issuing bank and a fee payable to the revolving lenders equal to the margin applicable to Eurodollar revolving loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.375% per annum to 0.50% per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving commitments. The unused commitment fee is determined on the basis of a grid that results in a lower unused commitment fee as the Company s total net leverage ratio declines. 

The First Lien Credit Facility contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, issuance of liens, investments, dividends, redemptions and other distributions to equity holders, asset sales, certain mergers or consolidations, sales, transfers, leases or dispositions of substantially all of the Company s assets and affiliate transactions.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the First Lien Credit Facility. 

The First Lien Credit Facility also requires prepayment in advance of the maturity date upon the occurrence of certain customary events, including based on an excess cash flow calculation, beginning as of the year ending December 31, 2016.     

The First Lien Credit Facility also contains a requirement that, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, if the amount the Company has drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of all commitments of the lenders thereunder, the Company maintain a first lien net leverage ratio not in excess of 7.0 times EBITDA. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has one outstanding letter of credit for the security deposit on a real property lease agreement. This letter of credit totals $50, reducing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility to $39,950. The Company pays a fee on the outstanding letter of credit at the applicable margin, which was 4.50% as of September 30, 2016, in addition to a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum. 

10 

Table of Contents  

Sellers Note 

The Company entered into a subordinated, unsecured promissory note for $9,000 ( Sellers Note ) with certain sellers of EFT Source, Inc. ( EFT Source ) in connection with its acquisition of EFT Source on September 2, 2014. All principal and unpaid interest under the Sellers Note was due and paid to the sellers on September 2, 2016.  Interest on the Sellers Note accrued at 5.0% per annum and was paid quarterly.  

Deferred Financing Costs 

Certain costs incurred with borrowings or the establishment or modification of credit facilities are reflected as a reduction to the long-term debt balance.  These costs are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the borrowing using the effective-interest rate method. 

8. Income Taxes 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $2,541 on pre-tax income of $6,567, representing an effective income tax rate of 38.7%, compared to an income tax expense from continuing operations of $6,554 on pre-tax income of $21,314, representing an effective tax rate of 30.7% during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $5,194 on pre-tax income of $14,607, representing an effective income tax rate of 35.6%, compared to an income tax expense from continuing operations of $16,528 on pre-tax income of $49,404, representing an effective tax rate of 33.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the impact of state taxes. 

The effective tax rates for all periods presented also differ from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a benefit from permanent deductions related to credits for domestic production activities and the impact of state and foreign income taxes. 

9. Series A Preferred Stock 

There were no outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  On August 17, 2015, t  he Company redeemed 62,140 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $276,688, at $4,4  46.70   per share. Of the $276,688 redemption amount, $55,946 was treated as a return of capital and $220,742 was treated as a dividend. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company redeemed a total of 62,233 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at prices ranging from $3,950.33 to $4,4  46.70   per share.  In addition, Series A Preferred Stock accrued dividends were $7,096 and $32,454 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

10. Stockholders  Equity 

Common Stock 

On May 11, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes repurchases of up to $20,000 of the Company s common stock, limited to a maximum of 2,827,105 common shares, prior to May 11, 2017.    Repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other transactions.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no common shares repurchased.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were 1,439,422 common shares repurchased for $6,008, at an average cost of $4.17 per share.  The repurchase has been accounted for as a share retirement. At September 30, 2016, $13,992 remained available under the share repurchase authorization, up to a maximum of 1,387,683 shares.     

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were 65,891 and 190,557 shares of common stock issued in connection with stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units, respectively (Note 13,  Stock-Based Compensation ).  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued no common stock and redeemed 86,768 shares of common stock at values of $0.32 and $0.91 per share.  During the three months

Table of Contents  

ended September 30, 2015, there was no common stock issued or redeemed.  The redeemed common stock share values were calculated in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid dividends of $2,487 and $5,031, representing $0.045 and $0.09 per share, respectively.  Additionally, on August 10, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share, payable on October 7, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016. The accrued dividend of $2,488 is reflected in  Accrued expenses  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has declared aggregate dividends of $0.135 per share. 

On September 3, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved a 22-for-1 stock split of its common stock. Upon the effective date of the stock split, each outstanding share of common stock and restricted common stock was divided into 22 shares of common stock or restricted common stock, as applicable. Shares of common stock available for issuance under the Option Plan (as hereinafter defined) were increased accordingly. All of the share numbers, share prices and exercise prices have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and these notes. 

11. Earnings per Share 

Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS attributable to continuing and discontinued operations: 

12. Commitments and Contingencies 

Commitments

Contingencies    

In Re CPI Card Group Inc. Securities Litigation  , Case No. 1:16-CV-04531 (S.D.N.Y.) 

On June 15, 2016, two purported CPI shareholders filed putative class action lawsuits captioned   Vance, et al. v. CPI Card Group Inc., et al  . and   Chipman, et al. v. CPI Card Group Inc.,   in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against CPI and certain of its officers and directors, along with the sponsors of and the financial institutions who served as underwriters for CPI s October 2015 IPO.  The complaints, purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of CPI common stock pursuant to the October 8, 2015 Registration Statement filed in connection with the IPO, assert claims under   11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) and seek, among other things, damages and costs.  In particular, the complaints allege that the Registration Statement contained false or misleading statements or omissions regarding CPI s customers  (i) purchases of Europay, MasterCard, and VISA chip cards (collectively,  EMV cards ) during the first half of fiscal year 2015 and resulting EMV card inventory levels, and (ii) capacity to purchase additional EMV cards in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, and the fiscal year .  The complaints allege that these actions artificially inflated the price of CPI common stock issued pursuant to the IPO.  

The Court has entered a briefing schedule on defendants' prospective motion(s) to dismiss the amended complaint. All discovery and other proceedings in the action are stayed under the PSLRA pending the resolution of such motions.   

The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously. Given the current stage of these matters, the range of any potential loss is not estimable and no accrual has been recognized as of September 30, 2016. 

Gemalto S.A. v. CPI Card Group Inc. (2 cases) 

First case  .  This suit was initially filed by Gemalto S.A. ( Gemalto ) against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in October 2015. The now-stayed complaint alleges that the Company infringes a Gemalto patent by incorporating into the Company s products microchips that allegedly practice the EMV standard. Gemalto s patent will expire in 2017. The Company successfully moved to transfer the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. On January 28, 2016, the Company answered the complaint and filed counterclaims that the asserted patent is invalid and unenforceable, and that Gemalto s lawsuit is a  sham  intended to interfere with the Company s IPO and business relationships. Gemalto answered the Company s counterclaims on February 5, 2016. On March 8, 2016, Gemalto provided specific infringement contentions, which contrary to the complaint s claim that all EMV-compliant products infringed upon Gemalto s patent only named CPI products that incorporate microchips supplied by two specific vendors. 

On May 31, 2016, the Company filed an Inter Partes Review petition with the United States Patent   Trademark Office s Patent Trial   Appeal Board, seeking re-examination of Gemalto s asserted patent.  In light of the Company s petition, on July 11, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado granted the Company s motion to stay the litigation pending the Patent Trial   Appeal Board s consideration of the Company s challenge to the patentability of asserted claims.   

Second case  .  On May 3, 2016, Gemalto filed a second patent infringement action against CPI in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint alleges that the Company infringes a Gemalto patent on networked smartcard printing by way of the Company s Card@Once offering.  Gemalto s patent will expire in 2018.  On May 25, 2016, the Company moved to dismiss Gemalto's case because the patent's claims are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. section 101. The Company s motion to stay the litigation in light of its pending motion to dismiss was denied on September 2, 2016.  The Company s motion to dismiss remains pending. Gemalto provided initial infringement contentions to the Company on July 29, 2016, and amended its contentions on October 13, 2016.

With respect to both cases, the Company believes Gemalto s claims are without merit and that the Company has strong legal and equitable defenses, plus meritorious counterclaims and indemnity rights. The Company intends to defend these suits vigorously. While a risk of loss is reasonably possible, given the current stage of these matters, as well as the aforementioned defenses, counterclaims and indemnity rights, the range of potential loss is not estimable and no accrual has been recognized as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to routine legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

14. Segment Reporting 

The Company has identified reportable segments as those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more of its revenue, EBITDA (as defined below), or total assets, or when the Company believes information about the segment would be useful to the readers of the financial statements. The Company s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer who is charged with management of the Company and is responsible for the evaluation of operating performance and decision making about the allocation of resources to operating segments based on measures such as revenue and EBITDA. 

EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance. As the Company uses the term, EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company s chief operating decision maker believes EBITDA is a meaningful measure and is superior to available GAAP measures as it represents a transparent view of the Company s operating performance that is unaffected by fluctuations in property, equipment and leasehold improvement additions. The Company s chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA to perform periodic reviews and comparison of operating trends and identify strategies to improve the allocation of resources amongst segments.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s reportable segments are as follows: 

U.S. Debit and Credit;     

U.S. Prepaid Debit; and     

U.K. Limited.     

The  Other  category includes the Company s corporate headquarters and less significant operating segments that derive their revenue from the production of Financial Payment Cards and retail gift cards in Canada (CPI Canada) and the U.K. (CPI Petersfield).  

In August 2015, the Company completed its shut-down and closure of its operation in Petersfield, United Kingdom.

Results of Operations 

The following table presents the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for each of the periods presented: 

Segment Discussion 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net Sales 

* Not meaningful 

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $26.5 million, or 24.6%, to $81.2 million compared to $107.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net sales was due to a 32.5% decline in U.S. Debit and Credit, a 2.4% decline in U.S. Prepaid Debit, a 20.6% decline in U.K. Limited and a 32.2% decline in Other. 

21 

Table of Contents  

U.S. Debit and Credit: 

Net sales for U.S. Debit and Credit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $23.6 million, or 32.5%, to $49.2 million compared to $72.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a $17.0 million decrease in EMV related revenue and a $10.9 million decrease in magnetic stripe card and other sales due to the ongoing shift of card issuing bank customers from magnetic stripe cards to EMV cards, partially offset by an increase of $4.3 million from growth in card personalization and fulfillment.   

The decrease in EMV revenue is due to a reduction of EMV card purchases from large issuers and processors, reflecting the carryover impact of overstocked EMV card inventories purchased in 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 22.6 million EMV cards at an average selling price ( ASP ) of $0.96 compared to 41.2 million EMV cards at an ASP of $0.94 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.      The increase in ASP for EMV cards during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 is primarily due to customer mix.    

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Net sales for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.6 million, or 2.4%, to $23.1 million compared to $23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower prices, partially offset by increased sales activity.        

U.K. Limited  :   

Net sales for U.K. Limited for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $2.0 million, or 20.6%, to $7.7 million compared to $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the British Pound resulted in a $1.4 million reduction of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  A further decrease of $0.6 million in net sales was related to softening volumes within our retail gift card customer base.     

Other: 

Net sales in Other decreased $1.3 million, or 32.2%, to $2.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in net sales in Canada related to timing of orders from one of our larger customers in Canada, and to the shut-down of the Petersfield, U.K. operation in August 2015.  See Note 1,  Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Petersfield, U.K. shut-down.     

Cost of Sales 

* Not meaningful 

Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $12.5 million, or 19.3%, to $52.1 million compared to $64.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was driven primarily by a 28.1% decrease in U.S. Debit and Credit, a 20.6% decrease in U.K. Limited and a 45.8% decrease in Other, partially offset by a 9.8% increase in U.S. Prepaid Debit.

Table of Contents  

U.S. Debit and Credit: 

Cost of sales for U.S. Debit and Credit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $12.5 million, or 28.1%, to $32.1 million compared to $44.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was driven by lower EMV chip and magnetic stripe card sales volumes resulting in lower corresponding manufacturing costs.  Lower per unit EMV chip prices also contributed to the decreased cost of sales during the quarter.  Higher cost of sales from growth in card personalization, fulfillment and other services partially offset the above decreases. 

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Cost of sales for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.2 million or 9.8%, to $13.9 million compared to $12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to increased materials and labor costs of $0.7 and $0.4 million, respectively, as a result of increased production volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.     

U.K. Limited  : 

Cost of sales for U.K. Limited for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.4 million, or 20.6%, to $5.5 million compared to $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher labor costs.  Fluctuations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and the British Pound resulted in a $1.0 million reduction of cost of sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Other: 

Cost of sales in Other decreased $1.7 million, or 45.8%, to $2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to our Petersfield, U.K. operation, which was shut-down in August 2015, and to a lesser extent, lower materials costs related to the decreased net sales in Canada.  

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 

Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $14.0 million, or 32.5%, to $29.1 million compared to $43.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 35.8% compared to 40.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

U.S. Debit and Credit: 

Gross profit for U.S. Debit and Credit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $11.1 million, or 39.4%, to $17.1 million compared to $28.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit for U.S. Debit and Credit was primarily driven by the reduction in net sales discussed above. Gross profit margin for U.S. Debit and Credit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 34.8% compared to 38.7% for the same period in the prior year due to lower overhead cost absorption attributed to reduced production volumes.

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Gross profit for U.S. Prepaid Debit during the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 16.5% to $9.2 million compared to $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit margin for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 39.7% compared to 46.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was due to lower sales prices and higher materials and labor costs attributed to the higher sales activity discussed above. 

U.K. Limited  : 

Gross profit for U.K. Limited decreased 20.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $2.2 million compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $0.4 million. Gross profit margin for U.K. Limited was 28.3% during both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Other: 

Other gross profit during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.6 million compared to $1.2 million during the same period in 2015.  The decrease is primarily due to decreased sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.   

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.7 million, or 4.2%, to $17.4 million compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by a 25.9% increase in Other expenses, partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in U.S. Debit and Credit,  a 23.8% decrease in U.S. Prepaid Debit, and a 24.1% decrease in U.K. Limited.  

U.S. Debit and Credit operating expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 4.3%, primarily due to general cost reductions in sales and administrative expenses. 

Operating expenses in U.S. Prepaid Debit decreased $0.4 million, or 23.8%, primarily driven by cost reductions in sales and administrative salaries. 

The $0.4 million decrease in U.K. Limited, representing a 24.1% decrease, was due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $0.2 million, and a $0.2 million decrease in administrative salaries and other salary related expenses. 

The $1.8 million increase in Other operating expenses was primarily due to $1.4 million in public company costs, $0.6 million in patent and shareholder litigation and related charges, and a $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction relating to the prior year shut-down of the Petersfield U.K. operation.  Public company costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 included $0.4 million of legal and insurance costs, $0.4 million of accounting, reporting and public filing expenses, and $0.6 million in salaries and benefits, board fees, contract labor and hiring expenses.

Operating margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 21.9% compared to 29.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to the lower sales volumes, and the lower overhead cost absorption from the decline in EMV production volumes discussed above.  

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Income from operations for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.5 million, or 15.3%, to $8.0 million compared to $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 34.7% compared to 40.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to the increased materials and labor costs and decreased sales, partially offset by the lower operating expenses discussed above.  

U.K. Limited  : 

Income from operations for U.K. Limited for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $0.8 million from $1.0 million due to $0.2 million of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as noted above.   

Other  : 

The loss from operations in Other was $7.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increased loss was primarily attributable to the higher corporate expenses partially offset by the reduction in operating losses related to the prior year shut-down of the Petersfield, U.K. operation discussed above. 

Interest, net  :   

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $5.0 million compared to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was driven by the $435.0 million First Lien Term Loan that the Company entered into in August 2015 in conjunction with the partial redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock.  

Income tax expense:    

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was income tax expense of $2.5 million compared to $6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in income tax expense was driven by the

decrease in income before taxes. The effective tax rate was 38.7% and 30.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher in the current year period primarily due to the impact of state and foreign income taxes. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net Sales 

* Not meaningful 

Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $39.2 million, or 14.0%, to $241.3 million compared to $280.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net sales was due to a 15.9% decrease in U.S. Debit and Credit, an 11.3% decrease in U.S. Prepaid Debit, a 7.2% decrease in U.K. Limited, and a 31.5% decrease in Other, compared to the same period in the prior year. 

U.S. Debit and Credit: 

Net sales for U.S. Debit and Credit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $31.1 million, or 15.9%, to $165.1 million compared to $196.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a $26.5 million decrease in EMV related revenue, and an $18.0 million decrease in net sales from non-EMV cards, including magnetic stripe cards due to the ongoing shift of card issuing bank customers from magnetic stripe cards to EMV cards, partially offset by a $13.4 million net sales increase from growth in card personalization, fulfillment and other services. 

The decrease in EMV revenue is the result of reduced EMV card purchases from large issuers and processors, reflecting the carryover impact of overstocked EMV card inventories purchased in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 86.5 million EMV cards at an ASP of $0.94 compared to 115.9 million EMV cards at an ASP of $0.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in ASP for EMV cards during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to customer mix. 

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Net sales for U.S. Prepaid Debit during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $6.1 million, or 11.3%, to $47.4 million compared to $53.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by net reductions in volumes, and to a lesser extent lower prices.  The decrease in volumes related to a large customer shifting some of its business to a competitor, who we believe is infringing on a company patent, as further described in Part II, Item 1,  Legal Proceedings , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

U.K. Limited  : 

Net sales for U.K. Limited for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.7 million, or 7.2%, to $21.9 million compared to $23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is attributable to $2.3 million of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in retail gift and loyalty card services of $0.5 million.

Other: 

Net sales for Other decreased $4.4 million, or 31.5%, to $9.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease related primarily to the shut-down of the Petersfield, U.K. operation in August 2015, which contributed $4.1 million in net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and to a lesser extent, a $0.3 million decrease to net sales in Canada, driven primarily by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar, which resulted in a $0.4 million reduction of net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cost of Sales 

* Not meaningful 

Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $16.3 million, or 9.2%, to $159.9 million compared to $176.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was due to an 11.1% decrease in U.S. Debit and Credit, a 3.8% decrease in U.S. Prepaid Debit, an 8.0% decrease in U.K. Limited and a 39.0% decrease in Other.    

U.S. Debit and Credit: 

Cost of sales for U.S. Debit and Credit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $13.6 million, or 11.1%, to $109.1 million compared to $122.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was driven by lower EMV chip and magnetic stripe card sales volumes resulting in lower corresponding manufacturing costs.   Lower per unit EMV chip prices also contributed to the decreased cost of sales. Higher cost of sales from growth in card personalization, fulfillment and other services partially offset the above decreases. 

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Cost of sales for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.2 million, or 3.8%, to $30.0 million compared to $31.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in materials, and to a lesser extent lower labor costs, corresponding to the decrease in net sales described above. 

U.K. Limited  : 

Cost of sales for U.K. Limited during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $16.1 million, representing a decrease of $1.4 million, or 8.0%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the United States dollar and the British Pound of $1.7 million, and lower overhead costs, were partially offset by higher labor and material costs related to increased net sales activity in card personalization and fulfillment services. 

Other: 

Cost of sales in Other decreased $4.6 million, or 39.0%, to $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to our Petersfield,

Table of Contents  

U.K. operation, which was shut-down in August 2015, and decreased costs related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar of $0.3 million, partially offset by increased material costs from a higher percentage of Canada net sales relating to EMV card sales.  

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $22.9 million, or 22.0%, to $81.5 million compared to $104.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 33.8% compared to 37.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

U.S. Debit and Credit: 

Gross profit for U.S. Debit and Credit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $17.5 million, or 23.9%, to $56.0 million compared to $73.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit for U.S. Debit and Credit was primarily a result of decreased EMV revenues offset by growth in our card personalization and fulfillment services. Gross profit margin for the U.S. Debit and Credit segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 33.9% compared to 37.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to lower overhead cost absorption attributed to reduced production volumes.   

U.S. Prepaid Debit: 

Gross profit for U.S. Prepaid Debit during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 21.9% to $17.4 million compared to $22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the decrease in net sales. Gross profit margin for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 36.7% compared to 41.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the increase in material and labor costs as a percent of sales, partially due to lower prices. 

U.K. Limited  : 

Gross profit for U.K. Limited for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 4.7% to $5.8 million compared to $6.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Decreases related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $0.6 million were partially offset by higher gross profit from an increase in net sales activity related to our card personalization and fulfillment services. Gross profit margin for U.K. Limited for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 26.6% compared to 25.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a larger percentage of  higher margin, card personalization services. 

Other: 

Other gross profit during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 9.6% to $2.3 million compared to $2.5 million during the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit in Canada related to the decrease in net sales.

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $4.9 million, or 10.6%, to $51.6 million compared to $46.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by a 30.3% increase in Other expenses and a 0.8% increase in U.S. Debit and Credit, partially offset by a 13.3% decrease in U.S. Prepaid Debit, and a 7.7% decrease in U.K. Limited.  

U.S. Debit and Credit increased $0.2 million, or 0.8%, primarily driven by increased salaries and benefits to support growth in the card personalization business.  

U.S. Prepaid Debit decreased $0.6 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to cost reductions in sales and administrative salaries. 

The $0.4 million, or 7.7%, decrease in U.K. Limited was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

The $5.7 million increase in Other was driven by public company costs of $4.0 million, patent and shareholder litigation and related charges of $2.6 million, a $0.6 million increase in stock-based compensation, and a $0.7 increase of other corporate expenses (primarily related to increases in consulting and contract labor, and information technology expenses).  These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million reduction of expenses relating to the prior year shut-down of the Petersfield, U.K. operation. Public company costs included $1.1 million of legal and insurance costs, $1.2 million of accounting, reporting and public filing costs, and $1.7 million in salaries and benefits, board fees, contract labor and hiring expenses.

Operating margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 22.4% compared to 27.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to the lower sales volumes, and lower overhead cost absorption attributed to the reduced production volumes discussed above.

Income from operations for U.S. Prepaid Debit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $4.3 million, or 23.9%, to $13.7 million compared to $18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operating margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 28.9% compared to 33.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in income from operations and operating margins was due to lower sales, and higher materials and labor costs as a percent of sales, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses, as discussed above.  

U.K. Limited  : 

Income from operations for U.K. Limited for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $1.5 million, or 5.3%, from $1.4 million primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

Other  : 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the loss from operations in Other was $22.3 million, compared to a loss of $16.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increased loss was primarily attributable to the higher corporate expenses, partially offset by reduced operating losses related to the shut-down of the Petersfield, U.K. operation discussed above. 

Interest, net  :   

Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $15.1 million compared to $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was driven by the $435.0 million First Lien Term Loan that the Company entered into in August 2015 in conjunction with the partial redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock.  

Income tax expense:    

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $11.3 million to $5.2 million compared to $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, driven by the decrease in income before taxes. The effective tax rate was 35.6% and 33.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher in the current year period primarily due to the impact of state income taxes.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $21.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Of this amount, $3.8 million was held in accounts outside of the United States. 

On August 17, 2015, we entered into a new First Lien Credit Facility with a syndicate of lenders, consisting of the $435.0 million First Lien Term Loan and the $40.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The First Lien Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility mature on August 17, 2022 and August 17, 2020, respectively.  

At the Company's election, interest rates under the First Lien Credit Facility are based on either a Eurodollar rate, subject to an interest rate floor of 1.0%, plus a margin of 4.50% or a base rate plus a margin of 3.50%. Letters of credit are subject to a 0.125% fronting fee payable to the issuing bank and a fee payable to the revolving lenders equal to the margin applicable to Eurodollar revolving loans. In addition, we are required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.50% per annum to 0.375% per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving commitments. The unused commitment fee is determined on the basis of a grid that results in a lower unused commitment fee as our total net leverage ratio declines.

The First Lien Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including among other things, certain restrictions or limitations on indebtedness, issuance of liens, investments, dividends, redemptions and other distributions to equity holders, asset sales, certain mergers or consolidations, sales, transfers, leases or dispositions of substantially all of our assets, and affiliate transactions. We may also be required to make repayments on the First Lien Term Loans in advance of the maturity date based on a calculation of excess cash flows, as defined in the agreement, beginning with the year ending December 31, 2016, with any payments due after the issuance of our annual financial statements in 2017.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the First Lien Credit Facility. At September 30, 2016, there were $312.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan, and we had $40.0 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.   

The Company had a subordinated, unsecured promissory note for $9.0 million with certain sellers of EFT Source.  Principal and unpaid interest due were fully repaid on September 2, 2016.   

During the second quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors approved a $20.0 million stock repurchase plan, up to a maximum of 2,827,105 shares, prior to May 11, 2017.  There were no shares repurchased under this plan during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, $14.0 million remained available under the share repurchase authorization, up to a maximum of 1,387,683 shares. 

On August 10, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share.  This dividend was paid on October 7, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016.   The accrued dividend of $2.5 million is reflected in  Accrued expenses  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  Our current quarterly cash dividend rate is $0.045 per share, or $0.18 per share on an annualized basis. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, who will evaluate the Company s dividend program from time to time based on factors it deems relevant. 

We believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations, and working capital for at least the next 12 months. 

Operating Activities 

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $39.8 million compared to $44.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by lower net income, partially offset by a net increase in cash flows from working capital, particularly from a decrease in accounts receivable.   

Investing Activities 

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12.4 million, which related to capital expenditures.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was $8.9 million, consisting of $13.9 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $5.0 million of cash provided from the sale of our Nevada operation.   

Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in financing activities was $19.5 million, related to the repayment of our subordinated, unsecured promissory note with certain sellers of EFT Source for $9.0 million, share repurchases of $6.0 million, and dividend payments of $5.0 million, partially offset by excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises of $0.5 million.   

Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $32.5 million, due to the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock and related dividends of $56.0 million and $220.7 million, respectively, the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our previous credit facility of $170.9 million, the payment of loan issuance costs in connection with our First Lien Term Loan of $17.8 million, and payment of IPO related costs of $2.1 million.  These cash payments were partially offset by proceeds from the First Lien Term Loan of $435.0 million.

Contractual Obligations 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes in our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, other than the repayment of the Company s $9.0 million promissory note with certain sellers of EFT Source in September 2016.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2015, for which there were no material changes as of September 30, 2016, included: 

Revenue Recognition;     

Multiple-Element Arrangements;     

Impairment Assessments of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets;     

Inventory Valuation;     

Stock-Based Compensation; and     

Income Taxes.     

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Ris  k 

As of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes in market risk for key input prices, labor and benefits costs, interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rates, or pricing from those included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedure  s 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), that are designed to assure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2016 due to the unremediated material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.    

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a current lack of finance   

32 

Table of Contents  

expertise that could result in a failure to properly account for non-routine and complex transactions in accordance with GAAP. With the oversight of senior management, we have taken steps to remediate the underlying causes of these material weaknesses, primarily through the development and implementation of formal policies, improved processes, as well as the hiring of additional finance personnel, including the appointment of our current Chief Financial Officer in September 2015 and Chief Accounting Officer in March 2016, both of whom are certified public accountants, and are familiar with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, from their previous experience in substantive financial roles with other public companies. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these remediation efforts as we consider in future reporting periods whether such control deficiencies have been fully remediated. 

Except for the continued remediation efforts described herein, there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management s override of the control.  The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II   Other Information   

Item 1. Legal Proceedings   

In Re CPI Card Group Inc. Securities Litigation  , Case No. 1:16-CV-04531 (S.D.N.Y.) 

On June 15, 2016, two purported CPI shareholders filed putative class action lawsuits captioned   Vance, et al. v. CPI Card Group Inc., et al  . and   Chipman, et al. v. CPI Card Group Inc.,   in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against CPI and certain of its officers and directors, along with the sponsors of and the financial institutions who served as underwriters for CPI s October 2015 IPO.  The complaints, purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of CPI common stock pursuant to the October 8, 2015 Registration Statement filed in connection with the IPO, assert claims under   11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) and seek, among other things, damages and costs.  In particular, the complaints allege that the Registration Statement contained false or misleading statements or omissions regarding CPI s customers  (i) purchases of Europay, MasterCard, and VISA chip cards (collectively,  EMV cards ) during the first half of fiscal year 2015 and resulting EMV card inventory levels, and (ii) capacity to purchase additional EMV cards in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, and the fiscal year .  The complaints allege that these actions artificially inflated the price of CPI common stock issued pursuant to the IPO.  

On August 30, 2016, the Court consolidated the   Vance   and   Chipman   actions and appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act ( PSLRA ).  On October 17, 2016, lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint, asserting the same claims for violations of   11 and 15 of the Securities Act. The amended complaint is based principally on the same theories as the original complaints, but adds allegations that the Registration Statement contained inadequate risk disclosures and failed to disclose (i) small and mid-size issuers  slower-than-anticipated conversion to EMV technology and (ii) increased pricing pressure and competition CPI faced in the EMV market.   

The Court has entered a briefing schedule on defendants' prospective motion(s) to dismiss the amended complaint. All discovery and other proceedings in the action are stayed under the PSLRA pending the resolution of such motions.   

The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously. 

Gemalto S.A. v. CPI Card Group Inc. (2 cases) 

First case  .  This suit was initially filed by Gemalto S.A. ( Gemalto ) against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in October 2015. The now-stayed complaint alleges that the Company infringes a Gemalto patent by incorporating into the Company s products microchips that allegedly practice the EMV standard. Gemalto s patent will expire in 2017. The Company successfully moved to transfer the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. On January 28, 2016, the Company answered the complaint and filed counterclaims that the asserted patent is invalid and unenforceable, and that Gemalto s lawsuit is a  sham  intended to interfere with the Company s IPO and business relationships. Gemalto answered the Company s counterclaims on February 5, 2016. On March 8, 2016, Gemalto provided specific infringement contentions, which contrary to the complaint s claim that all EMV-compliant products infringed upon Gemalto s patent only named CPI products that incorporate microchips supplied by two specific vendors. 

On May 31, 2016, the Company filed an Inter Partes Review petition with the United States Patent   Trademark Office s Patent Trial   Appeal Board, seeking re-examination of Gemalto s asserted patent.  In light of the Company s petition, on July 11, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado granted the Company s motion to stay the litigation pending the Patent Trial   Appeal Board s consideration of the Company s challenge to the patentability of asserted claims.   

Second case  .  On May 3, 2016, Gemalto filed a second patent infringement action against CPI in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint alleges that the Company infringes a Gemalto patent on networked smartcard printing by way of the Company s Card@Once offering.  Gemalto s patent will expire in 2018.  On May 25, 2016, the Company moved to dismiss Gemalto's case because the patent's claims are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. section 101. The Company s motion to stay the litigation in light of its pending motion to dismiss was denied on

September 2, 2016.  The Company s motion to dismiss remains pending. Gemalto provided initial infringement contentions to the Company on July 29, 2016, and amended its contentions on October 13, 2016.   

With respect to both cases, the Company believes Gemalto s claims are without merit and that the Company has strong legal and equitable defenses, plus meritorious counterclaims and indemnity rights. The Company intends to defend these suits vigorously. However, the Company may incur material legal expenses, and no assurance can be given that these matters will be resolved in our favor, and if determined adversely, whether indemnification will be received. Accordingly, it is not yet possible to reliably determine any potential liability that could result from these matters in the event of an adverse determination. 

CPI Card Group Inc. v. Multi Packaging Solutions, Inc. 

On October 11, 2016, the Company filed a patent infringement suit against Multi Packaging Solutions, Inc. ( MPS ) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  The complaint asserts that MPS ultrasecure gift card packages sold to at least one customer infringe a Company patent on ultrasecure gift card packages.  The Company s patent will expire in 2028.  MPS has been served with the complaint but has not yet responded.  The Company intends to vigorously assert its intellectual property rights in connection with this litigation. 

In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to routine legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factor  s 

The risk factors disclosed in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as supplemented by the disclosure in Part II, Item 1A  Risk Factors  of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, set forth information relating to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Such risk factors continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes with respect to such risk factors  . 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

None.

The Company s repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other transactions.   

There was no stock repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2016.
