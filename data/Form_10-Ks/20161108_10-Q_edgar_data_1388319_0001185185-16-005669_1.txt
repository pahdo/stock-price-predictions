NOTE 1   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements follows:

General 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of U.S. Stem Cell, Inc., (the  Company ), have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations (Regulation S-X) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results from operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2015 audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Basis and business presentation 

U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in August, 1999. The Company is in the cardiovascular sector of the cell technology industry delivering cell therapies and biologics that help address congestive heart failure, lower limb ischemia, chronic heart ischemia, acute myocardial infarctions and other issues. The business includes the development of proprietary cell therapy products as well as revenue generating physician and patient based regenerative medicine/cell therapy training services, cell collection and cell storage services, the sale of cell collection and treatment kits for humans and animals, and the operation of a cell therapy clinic. To date, the Company has not generated significant sales revenues in that they remain less than their total operating expenses, has incurred expenses, and has sustained losses. Consequently, its operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a research and development business enterprise.

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605-10 ) which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.

At the time of each transaction, management assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured. The assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client.

The Company s primary sources of revenue are from the sale of test kits and equipment, training services, patient treatments and laboratory services, and cell banking. 

Revenues for kits and equipment sold are not recorded until kits and equipment are shipped. Revenues from trainings are recognized when the training occurs. Any cash received as a deposit for trainings are recorded by the company as a liability.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(unaudited)

Patient treatments and laboratory services revenue are recognized when those services have been completed or satisfied.

Revenues for cell banking sales are accounted for as Multiple-Element Arrangements under ASC 605-10 which incorporates Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Because the Company sells its services separately, on more than a limited basis and at a price within a narrow range, the Company was able to allocate revenue based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE).

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred revenues of $98,699 and $71,961, respectively.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the fair value of the Company s stock, stock-based compensation, fair values relating to derivative liabilities, debt discounts and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Accounts Receivable 

Trade receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis; thus trade receivables do not bear interest. Trade accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

Any charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses. Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages and the current status of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, allowance for doubtful accounts was $15,306 and $-0-, respectively.

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. During the periods presented, there were no inventory write-downs.

Investments 

The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 323-10, Investments-Equity Methods and Joint Ventures ( ASC 323-10) which requires the accounting for investments where the Company can exert significant influence, but not control of a joint venture or equity investment. The Company accounted for its 33 percent ownership of U.S. Stem Cell Clinic, LLC utilizing the equity method of accounting. (See Note 3)

Stock based compensation 

The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by the Company in the same expense classifications in the statements of operations, as if such amounts were paid in cash. As of September 30, 2016, there were outstanding stock options to purchase 23,555,777 shares of common stock, 8,376,579 shares of which were vested.

Net Loss per Share 

The Company computes basic net loss per share by dividing net loss per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, adjusted to give effect to the 1,000-for-1 reverse stock split, which was effective in the market on November 5, 2015. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the  treasury stock  and/or  if converted  methods as applicable. The computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period.

Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Treasury Stock 

The Company uses the cost method when it purchases its own common stock as treasury shares and displays treasury stock as a reduction of shareholders  equity.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to a concentration of credit risk are cash and accounts receivable. Generally, the Company s cash and cash equivalents in interest-bearing accounts does not exceed FDIC insurance limits. The financial stability of these institutions is periodically reviewed by senior management.

As of September 30, 2016, five customers represented 22%, 18%, 13%, 10% and 10%, respectively, representing an aggregate of 73% of the Company s accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2015, three customers represented 32%, 18% and 16% respectively, representing an aggregate of 66% of the Company s accounts receivable.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s revenues earned from the sale of products and services were $729,813, of which one customer represented 18% of the Company s revenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s revenues earned from the sale of products and services were $557,612, of which one customer represented 11% of the Company s revenues.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(unaudited)

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s revenues earned from the sale of products and services were $2,097,341, of which one customer represented 13% of the Company s revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s revenues earned from the sale of products and services were $1,612,476, of which no customers represented 10% or more of the Company s revenues.

Research and Development 

The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ( ASC 730-10 ). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved as defined under the applicable agreement. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,847 and $9,313 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; and $12,764 and $39,696 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Fair Value 

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820-10 ) and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.

Derivative Instrument Liability 

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding convertible notes and warrants that contained embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives include certain conversion features and reset provisions. (See Note 6 and Note 8).

Income Taxes 

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10 ) for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.

Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate.  Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and are considered immaterial.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Reclassification 

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods  data to conform to the current year s presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income or losses. 

Subsequent Events 

The Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued.  Based upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S LIQUIDITY PLANS

The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements during nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred net losses of $2,396,635 and used $113,432 in cash for operating activities. These factors among others may indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

The Company's primary source of operating funds in 2015 and 2016 has been from revenue generated from sales with additional cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and the issuance of convertible and other debt. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, but expects these conditions to improve in 2016 and beyond as it develops its business model. The Company has stockholders' deficiencies at September 30, 2016 and requires additional financing to fund future operations.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold fully depreciated equipment for net proceeds (and gain) of $500.

Expenditures for repair and maintenance which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment are charged to operations. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts with the resulting gain or loss reflected in operations. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment for impairment in accordance with the guidance for impairment of long lived assets.

Litigation

On September 17, 2015, a product liability lawsuit was filed in Broward County, specifically Patsy Bade v. Bioheart, Inc. US Stem Cell Clinics LLC, Aleiandro Perez, ARNP, and Shareen Greenbaum, M.D., and on November 30, 2015, a product liability lawsuit was filed in Broward County, specifically Elizabeth Noble v. Bioheart, Inc. US Stem Cell Clinics LLC, Aleiandro Perez, ARNP, and Shareen Greenbaum, M.D. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, both matters settled by the Company s insurance policy with no additional cost to the Company.

On February 8, 2016, a collection lawsuit was filed in Broward County, specifically Roche Diagnostics Corp. v. U.S. Stem Cell, Inc., demanding judgement against the Company for an aggregate of $42,246 plus interest and costs for alleged unpaid product.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company settled all matters for a net payment of $8,500.

On August 30 th , 2016 Northstar Biotech Group, LLC ( NorthStar ) filed suit against the Company, of which the Company received notice several weeks later. In its suit, Northstar is seeking  a declaratory judgment from the Court as to whether its preferred shares were the subject of the Company s reverse stock split effective November 4, 2015 and also seeks the appointment of a receiver. Northstar did not seek money damages. The Company disputes Northstar s claims and intends to vigorously defend this matter.

On November 7, 2016, the Board of Directors, formed a separate committee to review and advise on improper activities undertaken by Charles Hart both during his tenure as a member of the Board of Directors and subsequent to his termination from the Board of Directors, specifically during the ninety days following his termination in which he is still considered an affiliate of the Company.  Charles Hart was a member of the Board of Directors of NorthStar and is, to our knowledge,  no longer a Director but remains a Member of the closely held NorthStar Biotech Group, LLC.     (See the Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Committee on August 2, 2016, reporting that on August 1, 2016, Charles Hart     was removed     as     a member of the Board of Directors). 

The Company is subject at times to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business.  Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  There was no outstanding litigation as of September 30, 2016 other then described above.

NOTE 12   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) on January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3   Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.

All items required to be recorded or measured on a recurring basis are based upon level 3 inputs.

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(unaudited)

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Upon adoption of ASC 825-10, there was no cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings and no impact on the financial statements.

The carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including convertible notes payable), and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity.

As of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any items that would be classified as level 1 or 2 disclosures.

The Company recognizes its derivative liabilities as level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed in notes 6 and 8. While the Company believes that its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed in Notes 6 and 8 are that of volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.

The derivative liability as of September 30, 2016, in the amount of $772,108 has a level 3 classification.

The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities as of September 30, 2016:

Fluctuations in the Company s stock price are a primary driver for the changes in the derivative valuations during each reporting period. The Company s stock volatility increased approximately 21% from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. As the stock volatility increases for each of the related derivative instruments, the value to the holder of the instrument generally increases. Stock price volatility is one of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of each of the Company s derivative instruments.

The estimated fair value of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the Company s expected volatility. Increases in expected volatility would generally result in a higher fair value measurement.

Overview

We are an emerging enterprise in the regenerative medicine/cellular therapy industry. We are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of cell based therapeutics that prevent, treat or cure disease by repairing and replacing damaged or aged tissue, cells and organs and restoring their normal function. Our business includes the development of proprietary cell therapy products as well as revenue generating physician and patient based regenerative medicine / cell therapy training services, cell collection and cell storage services, the sale of cell collection and treatment kits for humans and animals, and the operation of a cell therapy clinic.

US Stem Cell Training, Inc. ( SCT ), an operating division of our company, is a content developer of regenerative medicine/cell therapy informational and training materials for physicians and patients. SCT also provides in-person and online training courses which are delivered through in-person presentations at SCT s state of the art facilities and globally at university, hospital and physician s office locations as well as through online webinars. Additionally, SCT provides hands-on clinical application training for physicians and health care professionals interested in providing regenerative medicine / cell therapy procedures.

Vetbiologics, ( VBI ), an operating division of our company, is a veterinary regenerative medicine company committed to providing veterinarians with the ability to deliver the highest quality regenerative medicine therapies to dogs, cats and horses. VBI provides veterinarians with extensive regenerative medicine capabilities including the ability to isolate regenerative stem cells from a patient s own adipose (fat) tissue directly on-site within their own clinic or stall-side.

US Stem Cell Clinic, LLC, ( SCC ), a partially owned investment of our company, is a physician run regenerative medicine/cell therapy clinic providing cellular treatments for patients afflicted with neurological, autoimmune, orthopedic and degenerative diseases. SCC is operating in compliance with the FDA 1271s which allow for same day medical procedures to be considered the practice of medicine. We isolate stem cells from bone marrow and adipose tissue and also utilize platelet rich plasma.

U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. s comprehensive map of products and services:

All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult organism through its lifetime. Cellular therapy is the process that uses cells to prevent, treat or cure disease, or regenerate damaged or aged tissue. To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells such as through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, first bone marrow and then blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by the chemotherapy and radiation that are used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies are standard of practice world-wide and are typically reimbursed by insurance.

Within the field of cell therapy, research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded. Stem cells (in either embryonic or adult forms) are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells, such as white blood cells, nerve cells or heart muscle cells. Our cell therapy development efforts are focused on the use of adult stem cells; those cells which are found in the muscle, fat tissue and peripheral blood.

There are two general classes of cell therapies: Patient Specific Cell Therapies ("PSCTs") and Off-the-Shelf Cell Therapies ("OSCTs"). In PSCTs, cells collected from a person ( donor ) are transplanted, with or without modification, to a patient ( recipient ). In cases where the donor and the recipient are the same individual, these procedures are referred to as  autologous . In cases in which the donor and the recipient are not the same individual, these procedures are referred to as  allogeneic.  Autologous cells offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient and we believe the long-term benefits of these PSCTs can best be achieved with an autologous product. In the case of OSCT, donor cells are expanded many fold in tissue culture, and large banks of cells are frozen in individual aliquots that may result in treatments for as many as 10,000 people from a single donor tissue. By definition, OSCTs are always allogeneic in nature.

Various adult stem cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, neurologic and orthopedic, among other indications. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to better the human experience and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common diseases and/or from the process of aging.

According to Robin R. Young s Stem Cell Summit Executive Summary-Analysis and Market Forecasts 2014-2024, the United States stem cell therapy market is estimated to grow from an estimated $237 million in 2013 to more than $5.7 billion in 2020.

Specific to cellular therapy, we are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of autologous cellular therapies for the treatment of chronic and acute heart damage as well as vascular and autoimmune diseases.

In our pipeline, we have multiple product candidates for the treatment of heart damage, including MyoCell and Myocell SDF-1. MyoCell and MyoCell SDF-1 are autologous muscle-derived cellular therapies designed to populate regions of scar tissue within a patient s heart with new living cells for the purpose of improving cardiac function in chronic heart failure patients.

MyoCell SDF-1 is intended to be an improvement to MyoCell. MyoCell SDF-1 is similar to MyoCell but the myoblast cells to be injected for use in MyoCell SDF-1 are modified prior to injection by an adenovirus vector or non-viral vector so that they will release extra quantities of the SDF-1 protein, which expresses angiogenic factors.

AdipoCell is a patient-derived cell therapy proposed for the treatment of a variety of degenerative diseases. We hope to demonstrate that these product candidates are safe and effective complements to existing therapies for chronic and acute heart damage.

Our mission is to advance to market novel regenerative medicine and cellular therapy products that substantially benefit humankind. Our business strategy is, to the extent possible, finance our clinical development pipeline through revenue (cash in-flows) generated through the marketing and sales of unique educational and training services, animal health products and personalized cellular therapeutic treatments.

A fundamental shift in venture capital investment strategies where, management believes, financial sponsorship is now directed toward commercial or near commercial enterprises has required us to adapt our mission combining immediate revenue generating opportunities with longer-term development programs. Accordingly, we have developed a multifaceted portfolio of revenue generating products and services in our US Stem Cell Training, Vetbiologics, and US Stem Cell Clinic, operating divisions that will, if successful, financially support its clinical development programs. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value through the generation of short-term profits that increase cash in-flows and decrease the need for venture financings   a modern biotechnology company development strategy.

Today, our company is a combination of opportunistic business enterprises. We estimate that the products and services we offer through US Stem Cell Training, Vetbiologics, and US Stem Cell Clinics has the potential, although we cannot provide assurances as to if and when it will be accomplished, to drive up to $100 million dollars in cumulative peak annual revenues. What we are establishing is a foundation of value in the products and services we are and plan to sell from US Stem Cell Training, Vetbiologics, and US Stem Cell clinics. Our strategy is to expand the revenues generated from each of these operating divisions and to reinvest the profits we generate into our clinical development pipeline.

On January 29th, 2015 we announced an update and diversification of our clinical development pipeline. Our cardiovascular and vascular product candidates have been streamlined, putting, we believe, our best opportunities at the forefront of our efforts. The MYOCELL and MYOCELL SDF-1 candidates will, in our opinion, advance forward in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). We are in active prospective partnering discussion for the MYOCELL SDF-1 program. Partnering, we contend, will enhance our capabilities, reduce our development cost through cost sharing and potentially accelerate our time to approval and commercialization. We will apply our ADIPOCELL to a variety of indications. We believe that updating and diversifying our clinical development programs increases the probability of our success, brings operational and fiscal clarity to our company, and will ultimately enhance shareholder value.

We will continue to evaluate and act upon opportunities to increase our top line revenue position and that correspondingly increase cash in-flows. These opportunities include but are not limited to the development and marketing of new products and services, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing deals and more.

Further, if the opportunity presents itself whereby we can raise additional capital at a reasonable fair market value, our management will do so. Accordingly, we plan to continue in our efforts to restructure, equitize or eliminate legacy balance sheet issues that are obstacles to market capitalization appreciation and capital fund raising.

Results of Operations Overview

We are a research and development company and our MyoCell product candidate has not received regulatory approval or generated any material revenues and is not expected generate revenues until the later quarters of 2016, if ever. We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and anticipate incurring significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future as we continue clinical trials, undertake new clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals, make capital expenditures, add information systems and personnel, make payments pursuant to our license agreements upon our achievement of certain milestones, continue development of additional product candidates using our technology, establish sales and marketing capabilities and incur the additional cost of operating as a public company.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation reflects our recognition as an expense of the value of stock options and other equity instruments issued to our employees and non-employees over the vesting period of the options and other equity instruments. We have granted to our employees options to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock at the time of each grant, as determined by our Board of Directors, with input from management.

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10. Compensation ( ASC 718-10 ) which requires that all share-based payments to both employee and non-employees be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.

In awarding our common stock, our Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

our financial position and historical financial performance;

arm s length sales of our common stock;

the development status of our product candidates;

the business risks we face;

vesting restrictions imposed upon the equity awards; and

an evaluation and benchmark of our competitors; and

prospects of a liquidity event.

On April 1, 2013, the Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder approval, the establishment of the Bioheart 2013 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, or the  2013 Omnibus Plan . The 2013 Omnibus Plan reserves up to fifty thousand shares of common stock for issuance. On August 4, 2014, the Board of Directors approved to set the reserve to one hundred thousand shares of common stock for issuance and to close the 1999 Officers and Employees Stock Option Plan. On February 2, 2015, at the annual meeting of shareholders, the majority of shareholders approved the 2013 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. On November 2, 2015, the Board of Directors approved the increase of the reserve under the 2013 Omnibus Plan to five hundred million shares of common stock for issuance and effective September 16, 2016, approved an addition of twenty five million shares of common stock to the reserve. We currently have 9,383,070 available for future issuances.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our critical accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605-10 ) which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.

At the time of each transaction, management assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured. The assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client.

Revenues for kits and equipment sold are not recorded until kits and equipment are shipped. Revenues from trainings are recognized when the training occurs. Any cash received as a deposit for trainings are recorded by the company as a liability.

Patent treatments and laboratory services revenue are recognized when those services have been completed or satisfied.

Revenues for bank sales are accounted for as Multiple-Element Arrangements under ASC 605-10 which incorporates Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.

Research and Development Activities

We account for research and development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ( ASC 730-10 ). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved as defined under the applicable agreement. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred.

Derivative financial instruments

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts in Entity s own Equity ( ASC 815-40 ) became effective for the Company on October 1, 2009. The Company has identified the embedded derivatives related to the issued Notes and anti-dilutive warrants. These embedded derivatives included in our debt contain certain conversion features and reset provision. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of Asher Notes and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.

Inflation

Our opinion is that inflation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our operations.

Climate Change

Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

As of September 30, 2016, five customers represented 22%, 18%, 13%, 10% and 10%, respectively, representing an aggregate of 73% of the Company s accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2015, three customers represented 32%, 18% and 16% respectively, representing an aggregate of 66%, of the Company s accounts receivable.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we continued to finance our considerable operational cash needs with cash generated from financing activities.

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $113,432 in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $789,462 of cash used in the nine month period ended in September 30, 2015.

35 

Table of Contents 

Our use of cash for operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016  reflected a net loss generated during the period of $2,396,635, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation of $330,365, notes payable issued for services of $800,000, depreciation of $3,926, amortization of debt discounts of $556,910, net loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $269,822,  non-cash interest expense of $193,946, net with gain on settlement of debt of $49,681, net gain on sale of property and equipment of $500 and income from investments of $85,927. In addition we had a net increase in operating assets of $38,206 and an increase in accrued expenses of $176,102, accounts payable of $78,504 and in deferred revenue of $26,738.

Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities was $95,102 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 represented proceeds from our equity investment of $115,000 and $500 from sale of property and equipment, net with the purchase of treasury stock of $7,817 and purchase of equipment of $12,581 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $168,558 of cash used for the purchase of equipment of $894, purchase of treasury stock of $157,664 and investments in US Stem Cell Clinic, LLC of $10,000 for the same period in  2015.

Buy-Back Program

On January 13, 2015, we issued a press release announcing that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase outstanding common stock when beneficially prudent for our company and our shareholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have purchased an aggregate of 10,250 shares of our common stock in the open market at an average cost of $0.76 per share pursuant to our share repurchase program.  The share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase outstanding common stock by our company and our directors has continued through the final quarter of 2016. 

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was an aggregate of $205,949 in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $987,004 in the nine month period ended in September 30, 2015. In the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 we received proceeds from issuance of note payable of $523,089 and $15,000 net related party advances, net with repayments of notes payable of $228,814 and $103,326 related party advances and notes.

Existing Capital Resources and Future Capital Requirements

Our MyoCell product candidate has not received regulatory approval or generated any material revenues. We do not expect to generate any material revenues or cash from sales of our MyoCell product candidate until commercialization of MyoCell, if ever. We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and anticipate incurring significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our common stock and our incurrence of debt to provide the funds necessary to conduct our research and development activities and to meet our other cash needs.

At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $245,991. However our working capital deficit as of such date was approximately $6.7 million. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report dated March 8, 2016 in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 that included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and Note 2 of our unaudited financial statement for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 addresses the issue of our ability to continue as a going concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
