  (unaudited) 

1.      GENERAL    
    
  Interim Financial Statements 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements include the accounts of Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) and all entities in which Ryder has a controlling voting interest (subsidiaries) and variable interest entities (VIEs) required to be consolidated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and the disclosures herein are adequate. The operating results for interim periods are unaudited and are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for a full year.   
    
  Beginning in 2016, we reclassified the losses from fair value adjustments on our used vehicles from "Other operating expenses" to "Gains on used vehicles, net" within the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings.  Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 

2.      RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows,   which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance will be effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The standard is to be adopted on a retrospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated cash flows. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,   which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. The standard applies to financial instruments including, but not limited to, trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and net investments in leases.  The standard requires estimating expected credit losses over the remaining life of an instrument or a portfolio of instruments with similar risk characteristics based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts. The initial estimate of and the subsequent changes in expected credit losses will be recognized as credit loss expense through current earnings and will be reflected as an allowance for credit losses offsetting the carrying value of the financial instrument(s) on the balance sheet. The standard is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption as of January 1, 2019 permitted.  The standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method.  We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Share-Based Payments 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Stock Compensation,   which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The guidance will be effective January 1, 2017.  We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases,   which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.  The standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases.  This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.  The standard is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method. We are evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which together with related, subsequently issued guidance, requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU is effective January 1, 2018, and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard permits the use of either the modified retrospective or cumulative effect transition methods. We are evaluating transition methods and the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  
    
  Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which required an entity to present debt issuance costs as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability on the balance sheet. We adopted this guidance on   January 1, 2016   and reclassified   $15 million   from other assets to long-term debt in our   December 31, 2015   balance sheet.  Other than the change in presentation within the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, this accounting guidance did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

3.      REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT    

We lease revenue earning equipment to customers for periods typically ranging from   three   to   seven   years for trucks and tractors and up to   ten   years for trailers. The majority of our leases are classified as operating leases. However, some of our revenue earning equipment leases are classified as direct financing leases and, to a lesser extent, sales-type leases. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net investment in direct financing and sales-type leases was   $418 million   and   $438 million  , respectively. Our direct financing lease customers operate in a wide variety of industries, and we have no significant customer concentrations in any one industry. We assess credit risk for all of our customers including those who lease equipment under direct financing leases prior to signing a full service lease contract. For those customers who are designated as high risk, we typically require deposits to be paid in advance in order to mitigate our credit risk. Additionally, our receivables are collateralized by the vehicles which further mitigates our credit risk.

  (unaudited) 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of direct financing lease receivables past due was not significant, and there were   no   impaired receivables. Accordingly, we do not believe there is a material risk of default with respect to the direct financing lease receivables.  
    
  Revenue earning equipment held for sale is stated at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  Losses on vehicles held for sale for which carrying values exceeded fair value are recognized at the time they arrive at our used truck centers and are presented within  Gains on used vehicles, net   in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings.  For revenue earning equipment held for sale, we stratify our fleet by vehicle type (trucks, tractors and trailers), weight class, age and other relevant characteristics and create classes of similar assets for analysis purposes. For a certain population of our revenue earning equipment held for sale, fair value was determined based upon recent market prices obtained from our own sales experience for sales of each class of similar assets and vehicle condition.  These vehicles held for sale were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The following table presents our assets held for sale that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and considered a Level 3 fair value measurement: 

(1) 
    Assets held for sale in the above table only include the portion of revenue earning equipment held for sale where net book values exceeded fair values and fair value adjustments were recorded. The net book value of assets held for sale not exceeding fair value was   $75.8 million   and   $145.1 million   as of    September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Total losses represent fair value adjustments for all vehicles reclassified to held for sale throughout the period for which fair value was less than carrying value. 
       
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the components of gains on used vehicles, net were as follows:

4.       ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES    

(1) 
    Insurance obligations primarily represent claims for which we are self-insured.  
              (2) 
    The reduction in restructuring liabilities from December 31, 2015 principally represents cash payments for employee termination costs. The majority of the balance remaining in restructuring liabilities is expected to be paid by the end of 2016.

5.       DEBT

    Asset-backed U.S. obligations are related to financing transactions involving revenue earning equipment.  
               (4) 
    See   Note 2  , "  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  ," for further discussion of the presentation of debt issuance costs.  

We maintain a   $1.2 billion   global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of   twelve   lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., BNP Paribas, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Canada, Lloyds Bank Plc, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.  The facility matures in January 2020. The agreement provides for annual facility fees which range from   7.5 basis points   to   25 basis points   based on Ryder's long-term credit ratings.  The annual facility fee is currently   10 basis points  , which applies to the total facility size of   $1.2 billion  .   
    
  The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital but can also be used to issue up to   $75 million   in letters of credit (there were   no   letters of credit outstanding against the facility at   September 30, 2016  ).  At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryder s business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross-default provisions and certain affirmative and negative covenants. 
    
  In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated net worth of less than or equal to   300%  . Net worth, as defined in the credit facility, represents shareholders' equity excluding any accumulated other comprehensive income or loss associated with our pension and other postretirement plans. The ratio at   September 30, 2016   was   206%  .  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $514.4 million   available under the credit facility.

Our global revolving credit facility enables us to refinance short-term obligations on a long-term basis. Short-term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long-term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis. In addition, we have the intent and ability to refinance the current portion of certain long-term debt on a long-term basis. At   September 30, 2016  , we classified   $490.7 million   of short-term commercial paper,   $349.9 million   of current debt obligations and   $60.9 million   of short-term borrowings under our global revolving credit facility as long-term. At   December 31, 2015  , we classified   $547.1 million   of short-term commercial paper,   $300.0 million   of current debt obligations and   $25.3 million   of short-term borrowings under our global revolving credit facility as long-term.  
    
  In February 2016, we issued   $300 million   of unsecured medium-term notes maturing in November 2021. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay off maturing debt and for general corporate purposes. If these notes are downgraded below investment grade following, and as a result of, a change in control, the note holders can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of principal value plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
    
  We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a committed purchaser. The subsidiary is considered a VIE and is consolidated based on our control of the entity s activities. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to   $175 million  . The program was renewed in October 2016. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the   364  -day program will expire on October 23, 2017. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Sales of receivables under this program are accounted for as secured borrowings based on our continuing involvement in the transferred assets.   No   amounts were outstanding under the program at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding totaling   $338.9 million   and   $345.7 million  , respectively, which primarily guarantee the payment of insurance claims. 
    
  The fair value of total debt (excluding capital lease and asset-backed U.S. obligations) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was approximately   $5.21 billion   and   $5.06 billion  , respectively. For publicly-traded debt, estimates of fair value were based on market prices. For other debt, fair value was estimated based on a model-driven approach using rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The fair value measurements of our publicly-traded debt and other debt were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets for  Cash and cash equivalents,   Receivables, net  and  Accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments. 
    
  In February 2016, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status.

6.       DERIVATIVES    
    
  From time to time, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage our fixed and variable interest rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. We assess the risk that changes in interest rates will have either on the fair value of debt obligations or on the amount of future interest payments by monitoring changes in interest rate exposures and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We regularly monitor interest rate risk attributable to both our outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as any offsetting hedge positions. This risk management process involves the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity analyses, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had interest rate swaps outstanding which are designated as fair value hedges for certain debt obligations, with a total notional value of   $825 million   and maturities through   2020  .  Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 fair value inputs. The fair value of these interest rate swaps was approximately   $14.2 million   and   $5.4 million    as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The amounts are presented in "Direct financing leases and other assets" in our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments. Accordingly, there was no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps.  

7.       SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS    
    
  In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our employee stock plans (the program).  Under the program, management is authorized to repurchase (i) up to   1.5 million   shares of common stock, the sum of which will not exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Company s employee stock plans from December 1, 2015 to December 9, 2017,  plus (ii)   0.5 million   shares issued to employees that were not repurchased under the Company s previous share repurchase program.  The program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than   2 million   shares of Ryder common stock.  Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open-market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryder s quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan.   
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   379,896   shares for   $25.7 million   and   69,107   shares for   $6.1 million  , respectively. 

8.      ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS    
    
  The following summary sets forth the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax:

    These amounts are included in the computation of net pension expense. See   Note 11  , "  Employee Benefit Plans  ," for further information. 
       
  The loss from currency translation adjustments in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $37.9 million   was primarily due to the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar.  The loss from currency translation adjustments in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $73.1 million   was due to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar and British Pound against the U.S. Dollar.

10.      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS    
    
  Share-based incentive awards are provided to employees under the terms of various share-based compensation plans (collectively, the  Plans ). The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and principally include at-the-money stock options, unvested stock and cash awards. Unvested stock awards include grants of market-based, performance-based and time-vested restricted stock rights. Under the terms of our Plans, dividends are not paid unless the stock award vests.

11.       EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS    
    
  Components of net pension expense were as follows:   

During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that certain pension benefit improvements made in 2009 had not been fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation.  Because the amounts were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any individual period, and the cumulative amount is not material to 2016 results, we recognized a one-time, non-cash charge of   $7.7 million   in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" and a   $12.8 million   pre-tax increase to  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  in our second quarter 2016 consolidated condensed financial statements to correctly state the pension benefit obligation and account for these 2009 benefit improvements.  
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded adjustments of   $0.5 million   to previously recorded, estimated pension settlement charges related to the exit from U.S. multi-employer pension plans. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $65.3 million   to our pension plans. In   2016  , the expected total contributions to our pension plans are approximately $  80 million  . We also maintain other postretirement benefit plans that are not reflected in the above table. The amount of postretirement benefit expense was not material for the three or   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

12.     OTHER MATTERS    
    
  We are a party to various claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our continuing business operations including, but not limited to, those relating to commercial and employment claims, environmental matters, risk management matters (e.g., vehicle liability, workers  compensation, etc.) and administrative assessments primarily associated with operating taxes. We have established loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For matters from continuing operations, we believe that the resolution of these claims, complaints and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated condensed financial statements.   
    
  Our estimates regarding potential losses and materiality are based on our judgment and assessment of the claims utilizing currently available information. Although we will continue to reassess our reserves and estimates based on future developments, our objective assessment of the legal merits of such claims may not always be predictive of the outcome and actual results may vary from our current estimates.  
    
  Although we discontinued our South American operations in 2009, we continue to be party to various federal, state and local legal proceedings involving labor matters, tort claims and tax assessments. We have established loss provisions for any matters where we believe a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Other than with respect to the matters discussed below, we believe that such losses will not have a material effect on our consolidated condensed financial statements. 
    
  In Brazil, various matters related to income taxes and social contribution taxes, as well as tax credits used to offset those taxes, were assessed by the Revenue Department for the 1997, 1998, 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax years. When available and appropriate, we have entered into various amnesty programs offered by the Brazilian tax authorities to settle some of these assessments at a discount and continue to evaluate these when offered.  Payments to resolve open matters through these amnesty programs were not material and were reflected as costs in discontinued operations.  Open matters, combined, total approximately   $4 million   in assessments, penalties and interest and are pending at various levels of the administrative tax courts.  We believe it is more likely than not that our position will ultimately be sustained either in these administrative courts or in actions before the judicial courts, if required.

14.       SEGMENT REPORTING    
    
  Our primary measurement of segment financial performance, defined as segment  Earnings Before Tax  (EBT) from continuing operations, includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes non-operating pension costs and certain professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) EBT, Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) EBT and Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) EBT are our primary measures of segment performance. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services, public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal, marketing and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS, including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. 
    
  Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to the DTS and SCS segments. Inter-segment revenue and EBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as  Eliminations ).    
    
  The following tables set forth financial information for each of our segments and provide a reconciliation between segment EBT and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OVERVIEW 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and notes thereto included under Item 1. In addition, reference should be made to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. We report our financial performance based on three segments: (1) FMS, which provides full service leasing, commercial rental, contract maintenance, and contract-related maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; (2) DTS, which provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S.; and (3) SCS, which provides comprehensive supply chain solutions including distribution and transportation services in North America and Asia. Dedicated transportation services provided as part of an integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution to SCS customers are reported in the SCS business segment. 
    
  We operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, industrial, food and beverage service, consumer packaged goods (CPG), transportation and warehousing, technology and healthcare, retail, housing, business and personal services, and paper and publishing. 
    
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis (MD A) includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Please refer to the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section of this MD A for information on the non-GAAP measures included in the MD A, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and the reasons why we believe each measure is useful to investors.

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

Operating results were as follows: 

(1) 
    Non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section of this MD A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue and the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors. 
              (2) 
    Non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section for a reconciliation of EBT, net earnings and earnings per diluted common share to the comparable measures and the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. 
       
  Total revenue and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation)   increased     3%   in the   third quarter of 2016  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , total revenue   increased     3%   and operating revenue   increased     5%  . Total revenue and operating revenue growth in both periods was due to growth in the full service lease fleet and higher prices on replacement vehicles in FMS and new business, increased volumes and higher pricing in SCS and DTS. These increases were partially offset by lower demand in the commercial rental product line and negative impacts from foreign exchange. Increased total revenue was also partially offset by lower fuel costs passed through to customers.  
    
  EBT   decreased     6%   in both the   third quarter of 2016   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting lower used vehicle and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher full service lease results in FMS, lower insurance costs in DTS and increased pricing, new business and increased volumes in DTS and SCS. The 2016 EBT decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, also reflects a $7.7 million pension charge related to certain 2009 pension benefit improvements that were not fully reflected in our pension benefit obligation. EBT was negatively impacted by foreign exchange in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , by 100 basis points.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
    
   Lease and Rental  

Lease and rental revenues represent full service lease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS segment. Revenues were approximately   $803 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , consistent with the   third quarter of 2015  . For 2016,  higher full service lease revenue, driven by growth in the average full service lease fleet and higher prices on replacement vehicles, was offset by lower commercial rental revenue reflecting lower demand and a negative impact from foreign exchange. Revenues increased   3%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by a larger average full service lease fleet and higher prices on replacement vehicles, partially offset by lower commercial rental revenue reflecting lower demand and a negative impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue growth by   100 basis points   in both periods. 
    
  Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs consist of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental   increased     1%   in the   third quarter   and   4%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to higher depreciation and maintenance costs from a larger average lease fleet, partially offset by lower depreciation on a smaller average rental fleet (  13%   lower in the   third quarter   and   6%   lower in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ). Cost of lease and rental benefited by approximately   $9 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   and   $26 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to changes in estimated residual values effective   January 1, 2016  . Foreign exchange also reduced cost of lease and rental by   100 basis points   in both periods. 
    
  Lease and rental gross margin   decreased     3%   in the   third quarter   and   1%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Lease and rental gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at   31%   in the   third quarter   and decreased to   30%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The   decrease   in gross margin dollars in the   third quarter of 2016   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due to lower commercial rental demand, partially offset by higher prices on lease replacement vehicles and lease fleet growth, as well as benefits from improved residual values. The   decrease   in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflects lower commercial rental fleet utilization, partially offset by benefits from improved residual values. 
    
  Services  

Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our DTS and SCS segments, as well as contract maintenance, contract-related maintenance and fleet support services associated with our FMS segment. Services revenue increased   9%   in the   third quarter   and   8%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing in the DTS and SCS segments. The contract-related maintenance and contract maintenance product lines benefited from growth in fleet size, and contract-related maintenance revenue also increased from higher volumes. These increases were partially offset  

21 

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

by lower fuel prices passed through to our DTS and SCS customers. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenue growth by   200 basis points   in both periods.   
    
  Cost of services represents the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee-related costs, subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties) and maintenance costs. Cost of services   increased     9%   in the   third quarter of 2016   and   8%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower fuel and insurance costs. Foreign exchange reduced cost of services by   100 basis points   in both periods. 
    
  Services gross margin   increased     11%   in the   third quarter   and   10%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue   increased   to   18%   in the   third quarter   and remained at   17%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase in gross margin dollars reflects benefits from higher pricing, new business and higher volumes in our DTS and SCS segments. Increased gross margin dollars also benefited from growth in the full service lease fleet size, higher volumes in the contract-related business and growth in the contract maintenance fleet.  
    
  Fuel 

Fuel services revenue represents fuel services provided to our FMS customers. Fuel services revenue   decreased     8%   in the   third quarter   and   19%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to lower fuel prices passed through to customers. 
    
  Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee-related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel services   decreased     10%   in the   third quarter   and   19%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as a result of lower fuel prices. 
    
  Fuel services gross margin   increased     93%   in the   third quarter   and decreased   21%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Fuel services gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to   3%   in the   third quarter   and remained at   3%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of 2015. Fuel is largely a pass-through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel is established based on trailing market fuel costs. Fuel services gross margin was favorably impacted by these price change dynamics during the   third quarter of 2016   and the earlier part of 2015, and adversely impacted during the   third quarter of 2015  . 

Other operating expenses include costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS segment, such as facility depreciation, rent, purchased insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses   increased   slightly to   $28.0 million   in the   third quarter   and   decreased   to   $85.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to lower utility costs for FMS facilities. 

22 

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

SG A expenses   decreased     2%   in the   third quarter   and   increased     1%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The decrease in the   third quarter   is primarily due to lower compensation-related expenses and marketing-related costs and foreign exchange, partially offset by increased information technology costs and pension expense. The increase in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily due to increased pension expense and information technology costs, partially offset by lower compensation-related expenses, professional fees and foreign exchange. Foreign exchange reduced the growth in SG A expenses by   100 basis points  . Pension expense, which primarily impacts SG A expenses, increased   $2.9 million   in the   third quarter   and   $16.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to the impact of a lower asset return assumption and a higher discount rate. Pension expense in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , also increased due to a one-time charge of $7.7 million in the second quarter to reflect pension benefit improvements made in 2009 that were not fully reflected in our pension benefit obligation.  

Gains on used vehicles, net includes gains from sales of used vehicles as well as the selling costs associated with used vehicles and write-downs of vehicles to fair market values. Gains on used vehicles, net   decreased   to   $1.9 million   in the   third quarter   and   $33.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a drop in the market value of tractors which has resulted in lower gains on sales of used vehicles and higher fair market value write-downs. Global average proceeds per unit in the   third quarter   decreased from the prior year reflecting a   13%   decrease in tractor proceeds per unit, partially offset by a   2%   increase in truck proceeds per unit. Global proceeds per unit in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , decreased from the prior year reflecting a   12%   decrease in tractor proceeds per unit, partially offset by a   1%   increase in truck proceeds per unit in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  

Interest expense decreased   4%   in the   third quarter   and   2%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting a lower effective interest rate, partially offset by higher average outstanding debt. The lower effective interest rate in   2016   reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects planned vehicle capital spending. 

Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, 
  gains from sales of operating property, foreign currency transaction gains and other non-operating items. The increase in the   third quarter   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is primarily driven by increased rabbi trust investment income.

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

Provision for income taxes decreased   5%   in the   third quarter   and   4%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The decrease in the provision for income taxes reflects lower taxable earnings, partially offset by a slightly higher effective income tax rate.

    Non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section of this MD A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue, and segment total revenue to segment operating revenue, as well as the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors.  
       
  As part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as  Earnings Before Taxes  (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS), and excludes non-operating pension costs and other items discussed in   Note 14  , "  Segment Reporting  ," in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal, marketing and corporate communications. 
    
  The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS, including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. 
    
  Inter-segment revenue and EBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services billed to customers as well as the net gains on sale of this equipment (equipment contribution) and inter-segment fuel services are included in FMS, DTS and SCS and then eliminated (presented as  Eliminations  in the table above). Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in EBT for our DTS and SCS segments:  

The decrease in DTS equipment contribution is primarily driven by lower net gains on sales of vehicles previously used in DTS operations, partially offset by higher volumes. The increase in SCS equipment contribution is primarily driven by higher volumes. 
    
  Items excluded from our segment EBT measure and their classification within our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings follow:

The following table summarizes the components of the change in FMS revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 

(1) 
    Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of FMS total revenue to FMS operating revenue as well as the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this MD A.  
       
  FMS total revenue remained at   $1.16 billion   in the   third quarter   and increased slightly to   $3.40 billion   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher FMS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel), largely offset by a decline in fuel services revenue and negative impacts from foreign exchange. FMS operating revenue   increased     1%   in the   third quarter   and   4%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as a result of organic growth, primarily in the full service lease product line, partially offset by lower commercial rental revenue. In the   third quarter   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , foreign exchange negatively impacted both total and operating revenue growth by   100 basis point  s. 
    
  Full service lease revenue   increased     7%   in the   third quarter   and   8%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement vehicles. Foreign exchange negatively impacted full service lease revenue growth by   100 basis points   in both the   third quarter   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We expect favorable full service lease revenue comparisons to continue through the end of the year based on sales activity. Commercial rental revenue   decreased     14%   in the   third quarter   and   8%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to lower demand. We expect unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons through the end of the year based on a weaker demand environment. Contract-related maintenance revenue   increased     5%   in the   third quarter   and   12%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting favorable impacts from growth in the full service lease fleet and higher volumes.  
    
  The following table provides commercial rental statistics on our global fleet:

  FMS EBT   decreased     11%   in the   third quarter   and   10%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting lower used vehicle and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Used vehicle results decreased due to lower tractor pricing as well as lower sales volume in   third quarter  . Commercial rental results declined from lower demand in both periods. The commercial rental results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were also negatively impacted by a   210 basis point   decline in utilization. Full service lease results benefited from growth in the average lease fleet size. Full service lease and commercial rental results benefited from approximately   $9 million   of lower depreciation in the   third quarter   and   $26 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to residual value changes implemented   January 1, 2016  .

The following table provides a breakdown of our non-revenue earning equipment included in our global fleet count (number of units rounded to nearest hundred): 

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NYE units   decreased   compared to   September 30, 2015  , reflecting lower lease fleet growth and the redeployment of used vehicles to fulfill lease sales. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. NLE units   increased   compared to   September 30, 2015   primarily due to higher used vehicle inventories and a higher number of units being prepared for sale. We expect NLE levels to remain around current levels through the end of the year.

In the   third quarter of 2016  , DTS total revenue   increased     15%   reflecting organic growth, partially offset by lower fuel prices passed through to our customers. DTS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation)   increased     7%   due to increased volumes, new business and higher pricing. DTS EBT   increased     32%   in the   third quarter of 2016  , primarily due to increased revenue. 
    
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , DTS total revenue   increased     15%   reflecting organic growth, partially offset by lower fuel prices passed through to our customers. DTS operating revenue   increased     10%   due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. We expect DTS total revenue and DTS operating revenue comparisons to remain favorable through the end of the year; however, at a lower growth rate. DTS EBT   increased     39%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to increased revenue.

   In the   third quarter of 2016  , SCS total revenue   increased     8%   as growth in SCS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. SCS operating revenue   increased     8%   in the   third quarter of 2016  , primarily due to new business and increased volumes, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. SCS EBT   increased     16%   in the   third quarter of 2016   due to the benefits of higher revenue. 
    
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , SCS total revenue   increased     5%  , as growth in SCS operating revenue was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. SCS operating revenue   increased     7%   due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect SCS total revenue and SCS operating revenue comparisons to remain favorable through the end of the year; however, at a lower growth rate. SCS EBT   increased     13%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to higher pricing, new business and increased volumes.

  Cash Flows 
    
  The following is a summary of our cash flows from continuing operations: 

Cash provided by operating activities   increased   to   $1.18 billion   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $1.07 billion   in   2015  , due to higher earnings adjusted for non-cash items, primarily depreciation, and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities was   $55.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with cash provided from financing activities of   $664.8 million   in   2015  , due to lower borrowing needs.  Cash used in investing activities   decreased   to   $1.11 billion   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $1.71 billion   in   2015  , primarily due to lower payments for capital expenditures. 
    
   Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment.  We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other investing cash inflows from continuing operations as  total cash generated , a non-GAAP financial measure. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) from continuing operations as  free cash flow , also a non-GAAP financial measure.

The following table provides a summary of capital expenditures: 

Capital expenditures   decreased     33%   to   $1.40 billion   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting planned lower investments in our commercial rental and lease fleet. We expect full-year   2016   capital expenditures to be approximately   $2 billion  . We expect to fund   2016   capital expenditures primarily with internally generated funds and additional debt financing. 
    
  Financing and Other Funding Transactions 
    
  We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset-based product lines. The variety of debt financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long-term and medium-term public and private debt, asset-backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium-term notes. 
    
  Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both our short-term and long-term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short-term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, assuming ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. 
    
  Our debt ratings and rating outlooks at   September 30, 2016  , were as follows:

Cash and equivalents totaled   $75 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $45 million   was held outside the U.S. and is available to fund operations and other growth of non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we decide to repatriate cash and equivalents held outside the U.S., we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund our U.S. operations. 
    
  We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to the public unsecured bond market, commercial paper market and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in the public unsecured debt market or the commercial paper market would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to public bonds, commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and/or by seeking other funding sources.

See   Note 5  , "  Debt  ", in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for a discussion of these debt facilities. 
    
  The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 

In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 20% - 40% variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable-rate portion of our total debt (including notional value of swap agreements) was   32%   and   30%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Refer to   Note 5  ,    Debt  ,  in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility, the trade receivables program, the issuance of medium-term notes under our shelf registration statement, asset-backed financing obligations and debt maturities.  
  Ryder s debt to equity ratios were   263%   and   277%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The debt to equity ratio represents total debt divided by total equity.

Pension Information 
    
  The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. In   2016  , the expected total contributions to our pension plans are approximately $  80 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $65.3 million   to our pension plans. Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during   2016   could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and contributions in   2016   and beyond.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information extracted from consolidated condensed financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain elements of this information are considered  non-GAAP financial measures  as defined by SEC rules. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in the management's discussion and analysis or in this non-GAAP financial measures section.  We also provide the reasons why management believes each non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in this section. 
  Specifically, we refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q:

Set forth in the table below is an explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors:                            Operating Revenue Measures  : 

Operating Revenue 
  FMS Operating Revenue 
  DTS Operating Revenue 
  SCS Operating Revenue 
  FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue 
  DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue 
  SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue 
    Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for Ryder System, Inc. or each business segment (FMS, DTS and SCS), respectively, excluding any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted transportation. We believe operating revenue provides useful information to investors as we use it to evaluate the operating performance of our core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well as for each of our business segments.  We also use segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason. Note: FMS EBT, DTS EBT and SCS EBT, our primary measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP measures. 
  Fuel  :  We exclude FMS, DTS and SCS fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers, which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, and the costs are largely a pass-through to our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs.   
  Subcontracted transportation  :  We also exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as these services are also typically a pass-through to our customers and, therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability. While our DTS and SCS business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers, our FMS business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and, therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS. 
           Comparable Earnings Measures  : 

Comparable earnings before income tax (EBT) 
  Comparable Earnings 
  Comparable earnings per diluted common share (EPS) 
    
    Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. We believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance. 
  Non-Operating Pension Costs  :  Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement costs. We exclude non-operating pension costs because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business.  
  Other Significant Items  :  Our comparable earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. These other significant items vary from period to period and, in some periods, there may be no such significant items. In this reporting period, we exclude the following other significant items from our comparable earnings measures in this Form 10-Q:   
  ___  (1)   Pension-related adjustments   (in the year to date 2016, third quarter 2015 and year to date 2015).  In the second quarter of 2016, it was determined that certain pension benefit improvements made in 2009 were not fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation, resulting in a charge to reflect those pension benefits. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, we recognized a benefit from lower than anticipated settlement charges to exit multi-employer pension plans. 
        (2)   Professional fees   (in the third quarter and year to date 2015). These charges represent professional fees associated with the assessment of potential cost savings initiatives. 
  ___  (3)   A benefit from a tax law change   (in the year to date 2015). In the second quarter of 2015, the states of Connecticut and Texas and the city of New York enacted changes to their tax systems, which decreased Ryder's provision for income taxes in each jurisdiction. 
  Calculation of comparable tax rate  :  The comparable provision for income taxes is computed using the same methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which the non-GAAP adjustments relate.

    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 

Cash Flow Measures  : 

Total Cash Generated 
  Free Cash Flow 
    
    We consider total cash generated and free cash flow to be important measures of comparative operating performance, as our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment.  
  Total Cash Generated  :  Total cash generated is defined as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment and (3) operating property and equipment, (4) collections on direct finance leases and (5) other cash inflows from investing activities. We believe total cash generated is an important measure of total cash flows generated from our ongoing business activities.  
  Free Cash Flow  :  We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) from continuing operations as  free cash flow . We calculate free cash flow as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment and (3) operating property and equipment, (4) collections on direct finance leases and (5) other cash inflows from investing activities, less (6) purchases of property and revenue earning equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders, after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

Volatility in customer volumes and shifting customer demand in the industries serviced by our SCS business 

Changes in current financial, tax or regulatory requirements that could negatively impact the leasing market 

Competition: 

Advances in technology may require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 

Competition from other service providers, some of which have greater capital resources or lower capital costs, or from our customers, who may choose to provide services themselves 

Continued consolidation in the markets in which we operate which may create large competitors with greater financial resources 

Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to economic conditions, demand for services, customer acceptance or competition

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  There have been no material changes to Ryder s exposures to market risks since   December 31, 2015  . Please refer to the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Ryder s exposures to market risks. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the   third quarter of 2016  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including Ryder s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Ryder s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the    third quarter of 2016  , Ryder s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in Ryder s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  The following table provides information with respect to purchases we made of our common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we purchased an aggregate of   60,261   shares of our common stock in employee-related transactions. Employee-related transactions may include: (i) shares of common stock withheld as payment for the exercise price of options exercised or to satisfy the employees' tax withholding liability associated with our share-based compensation programs and (ii) open-market purchases by the trustee of Ryder s deferred compensation plans relating to investments by employees in our stock, one of the investment options available under the plans. 
              (2) 
    In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our employee stock plans.  Under the December 2015 program, management is authorized to repurchase (i) up to 1.5 million shares of common stock, the sum of which will not exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Company s employee stock plans from December 1, 2015 to December 9, 2017  plus (ii) 0.5 million shares issued to employees that were not purchased under the Company s previous share repurchase program. The December 2015 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock.  Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open-market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2015 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryder s quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan.

    a.        Annual Meeting 
    The annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation shall be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Florida, as may be designated by the Board of Directors, at which meeting, in accordance with the Restated Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the stockholders shall elect members of the Board of Directors and transact such other business as lawfully may come before it. 
  b.        Special Meetings 
    (1)        Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the holders of record of not less than one-tenth of all the shares outstanding and entitled to vote at such meeting or by the Board of Directors; and such meetings shall be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Florida, as may be designated by the Board of Directors. 
    (2)        Before a stockholder may request or demand that a special meeting of the stockholders be held for any purpose, the following procedure must be satisfied: 
    (A)        Any stockholder seeking to request or demand, or to have the stockholders request or demand, a special meeting shall first, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date, pursuant to Section 3.b. of Article V of these By-Laws, for the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to request the special meeting.  The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date upon which such a request is received, fix such a record date.  Every request to fix a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to request a special meeting shall be in writing and shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the special meeting is requested, the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation s books, of each stockholder making the request and the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned of record by each such stockholder, and shall bear the signature and date of signature of each such stockholder. 
    In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of any request(s) or demand(s) by stockholders with respect to a special meeting, and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation  
  
   2 

shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing a prompt ministerial review of the validity of the request(s), demand(s) and/or revocation(s). 
    (B)        No request or demand with respect to calling a special meeting of stockholders shall constitute a valid and effective stockholder request or demand for a special meeting (i) unless (A) within 60 days of the record date established in accordance with subsection b(2)(A) of this Section, written requests or demands signed by stockholders of record representing a sufficient number of shares as of such record date to request or demand a special meeting pursuant to subsection b(1) of this Section are delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in person or by facsimile, or sent by U.S. certified mail and received by the Secretary of the Corporation, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation and (B) each request or demand is made in accordance with and contains the information required by Section 5.b of this Article IV and (ii) until such date as the independent inspectors engaged in accordance with this subsection b(2) certify to the Corporation that the requests or demands delivered to the Corporation in accordance with clause (i) of this subsection b(2)(B) represent at least the minimum number of shares that would be necessary to request such a meeting pursuant to subsection b(1) of this Section. 
    (3)        If the Corporation determines that a stockholder or stockholders have satisfied the notice, information and other requirements specified in subsection b(2)(B)(i) of this Section, then the Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution calling a special meeting of the stockholders and fixing a record date, pursuant to Section 3.b. of Article V, for the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting.  Notice of such special meeting shall be provided in accordance with Section 1.c. of this Article IV, provided that such notice shall be given within 60 days (or such longer period as from time to time may be permitted by law) after the date the request(s) or demand(s) for such special meeting is (are) delivered to the Corporation in accordance with subsection b(2)(B)(i) of this Section. 
    (4)        In fixing a meeting date for the special meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding the request, and any plan of the Board of Directors to call a special or annual meeting of stockholders for the conduct of related business, provided that such meeting date shall be within 120 days (or such longer period as may from time to time be permitted by law) after the date the request(s) or demand(s) for such special meeting is (are) delivered to the Corporation in accordance with subsection b(2)(B)(i) of this Section. 
    (5)        Nothing contained in this Section 1.b. shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request or  
  
   3 

demand or revocation thereof, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto). 
    c.        Notice of Meetings 
    Except as otherwise permitted by law, notice of all meetings of stockholders stating the time and place, and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given, by mailing, or by transmitting by electronic mail or any other type of electronic transmission, or by any other method permitted by law, to each stockholder entitled to vote (or by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if they consent, or are deemed to consent, to a single notice) no less than ten days nor more than sixty days before the date set for such meeting.  Such notice shall be deemed to be delivered (1) when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, or (2) at the time the notice is electronically transmitted to the stockholder in a manner authorized by the stockholder if such authorization is required by law, or (3) at such other time as provided by law with respect to other methods of giving such notice as are permitted by law. 
    d.        Preparation of Voting List of Stockholders 
    The Secretary shall prepare and make, or cause to be prepared and made, at least ten days before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, with the address of and the number and class and series, if any, of shares held by each stockholder as such information appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation.  Such list shall be kept on file at the principal place of business of the Corporation, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during normal business hours for said ten day period (or such shorter time as exists between the record date and the meeting) upon receipt by the Secretary of a written request to make such an examination, and shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting, and any adjournment thereof, subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.  
    Section 2.          Quorum and Vote of Stockholders 
  a.        Quorum and General Voting Requirements 
    The holders of a majority of the voting power of the total number of shares outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy thereat, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Restated Articles of Incorporation.  If, however, a quorum does not exist at a meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares  
  
   4 

present or represented and entitled to vote at such meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than by announcement at the meeting, until holders of the requisite number of shares entitled to vote shall be present.  Except as otherwise required by law, at any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum exists, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.  The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business in accordance with these By-Laws until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. 
    For purposes of this Section 2, shares entitled to vote on any matter presented for action by stockholders at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy thereat, shall be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum for the transaction of all business at a meeting. 
    If a quorum is present, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) shall be approved by the stockholders of the Corporation if the matter receives the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy) by the holders of the total number of shares outstanding and entitled to vote on such matter, unless the matter is one upon which, by express provision of law a greater vote is required or from time to time permitted by action of the Board of Directors, or by the Restated Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws a greater or different vote is required, in any which case such express provision shall govern and control the requisite vote requirement.  For purposes of clarity,  abstentions,   withheld  votes and  broker non-votes  shall not be counted as a vote cast with respect to such action.  
    b.        Election of Directors 
    At a meeting where a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director by the holders of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to be voted in the election of directors; provided that if the number of persons to be considered by the stockholders for election as a director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with such determination thereof to be made by the Secretary of the Corporation as of the close of the notice of nomination periods set forth in Section 5 of this Article IV, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to be voted in the election of directors; further provided that all persons considered for election (other than those recommended for nomination by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall have met all applicable requirements and procedures in being placed in nomination and considered for election, including without limitation the requirements set forth in these By-Laws and in all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  For purposes of this subsection 2.b., votes cast means votes  for  a director or  withheld  with respect to a director. 
  
   5 

Section 3.          Voting by Stockholders 
    Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting may do so in person or by proxy appointed by instrument signed or otherwise authorized by the stockholder or by the stockholder s attorney-in-fact in writing or in any other manner permitted by law. 
    Section 4.          Stockholder Action 
    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. 
    Section 5.          Notice of Stockholder Business and Director Nominations 
    a.        Annual Meetings of Stockholders 
    (1)        General  .  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of any other business to be considered by the stockholders of the Corporation may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, only (i) pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 5 and at the time of the annual meeting, (B) is entitled to vote at the annual meeting for the election of directors or the proposal, as applicable, and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5 and the other requirements of these By-Laws as to such business or nomination.  Clause (C) of this Section 5(a)(1) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and included in the Corporation s notice of meeting) before an annual meeting of stockholders. 
    (2)        Timely Notice  .  Without qualification or limitation, for any nominations or any other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder of the Corporation pursuant to Section 5(a)(1)(C) hereof, the stockholder previously must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form (as more fully described in Section 5(a)(3) hereof) to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such other business must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action.  To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in person or by facsimile, or sent by U.S. certified mail and received by the Secretary of the Corporation, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior and not later than the close of business on the 90th day  
  
   6 

prior to the first anniversary of the date of the Corporation s immediately preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such first anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the Corporation; provided, however, Section 5(g)(4) shall govern timeliness of nominations submitted pursuant to a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to such Section 5(g).  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the public announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of notice by a stockholder as described above. 
    In addition, to be considered timely, a stockholder s notice to the Secretary of the Corporation shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in person or by facsimile, or sent by U.S. certified mail and received by the Secretary of the Corporation, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.  For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to update and supplement as set forth in this paragraph or any other Section of these By-Laws shall not limit the Corporation s rights with respect to any deficiencies in any notice provided by a stockholder, extend any applicable deadlines hereunder or under any other provision of the By-Laws or enable or be deemed to permit a stockholder who has previously submitted notice hereunder or under any other provision of the By-Laws to amend or update any proposal or to submit any new proposal, including by changing or adding nominees, matters, business and or resolutions proposed to be brought before a meeting of the stockholders. 
    (3)           Notice in Proper Written Form  .  To be in proper written form, a stockholder s notice to the Secretary of the Corporation (whether given pursuant to Section 5(a) or Section 5(b) or Section 5(g) hereof) must set forth in writing: 
    (A)           as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made: 
  
   7 

(i)           the name and address of such stockholder as they appear on the Corporation s books, and of such beneficial owner, if any; 
    (ii)           (a)         the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are, directly or indirectly, owned of record  and/or owned beneficially by the stockholder and such beneficial owner, if any, and a representation that the stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, will notify the Corporation in writing of the class or series and number of such shares owned of record and beneficially as of the record date for the meeting, promptly following the later of the record date and the date notice of the record date is first publicly announced; 
    (b)        any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a  Derivative Instrument ) directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any,        and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation; 
  (c)        any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship pursuant to which such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, has a right to vote any shares of any security of the Corporation; 
  (d)        any short interest in any security of the Corporation (for purposes hereof, a person or entity shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person or entity directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security); 
    (e)        any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation;

    (i)        a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, any material interest of such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the business is being proposed and of each of their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert therewith, if any, in such business and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment; and 
  
   9 

(ii)        a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and/or beneficial owner, if any, and any other person or persons (including the names of such persons) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder.

    (ii)           a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Regulation S-K (or any successor rule or regulation) if the stockholder making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the  registrant  for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such  registrant  and 
    (D)  If the stockholder proposes to nominate a person for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, the notice must also include a completed and signed nominee questionnaire, representation and agreement, as required by Section 6 of this Article IV.  Information regarding a nominee for director provided by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 5 shall include such information as may be necessary to enable the Board of Directors to make an informed determination as to whether such nominee, if elected, would be an  independent director  as defined in the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange on which  
  
   10 

the Corporation s Common Stock is listed or quoted, or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. 
  (4)           Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (a)(2) above to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of stockholders is increased in accordance with Article V, Section 2 hereof and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for directors or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, a stockholder s notice required by this Section 5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in person or by facsimile, or sent by U.S. certified mail and received by the Secretary of the Corporation, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation; provided, however, Section 5(g)(4) shall govern timeliness of nominations submitted pursuant to a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to such Section 5(g). 
  (5)        For purposes of this Section 5,  affiliate  and  associate  shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided, however, that the term  partner  as used in the definition of  associate  shall not include any limited partner that is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership. 
     b.        Special Meetings of Stockholders  . 
    Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (a) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of notice provided for in this Section 5 and at the time of the special meeting, (b) is entitled to vote at the meeting for the election of directors and (c) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5 as to such nomination. In the event a special meeting of stockholders is properly called by the Corporation for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation s notice of meeting, if the stockholder s notice required by Sections 5(a)(2) and 5(a)(3) hereof with respect to any nomination (including the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 5(a)(3)(D) hereof) shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in person or by facsimile, or sent by U.S. certified mail and received by the Secretary of the  
  
   11 

Corporation, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting is first made by the Corporation.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or the public announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of notice by a stockholder as described above. 
  In addition, to be considered timely, a stockholder s notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting, any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
    c.        If the notice requirements set forth in this Section 5 are satisfied by a stockholder and such stockholder s nominee or proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit proxies for the applicable meeting of stockholders and such stockholder does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such nominee or proposal at such meeting, the Corporation need not present such nominee or proposal for a vote at such meeting notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.  For purposes of this Section 5, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission (as defined in the Florida Business Corporation Act, as amended) delivered by such stockholder to the Secretary of the Corporation (in the case of a writing, delivered in person or by facsimile, or sent by U.S. certified mail and received, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation) to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable printed reproduction of such writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders. 
    d.        Only such persons as are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article IV, Section 5 or are chosen to fill any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors in accordance with Article V, Section 1 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of  
  
   12 

stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article IV, Section 5.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article IV, Sections 5-6, as applicable, and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Article IV, Sections 5-6, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded. 
  e.        For purposes of this Section 5,  public announcement  shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Services, Associated Press or comparable national news service, in a document publicly filed or furnished by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or posted on the Corporation s website. 
  f.        Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and all applicable rules and requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) or, if the Corporation s shares are not listed on the NYSE, the applicable rules and requirements of the primary securities exchange or quotation system on which the Corporation s shares are listed or quoted, in each case with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that any references in these By-Laws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to Section 5(a)(1)(C) or Section 5(b) hereof.  Nothing in this Section 5 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any class or series of stock having preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation if and to the extent provided for under law, the Restated Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws. 
  g.        Inclusion of Stockholder Director Nominations in the Corporation s Proxy Materials.   
  (1)        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these By-Laws, the Corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders held after the 2016 annual meeting the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (a  Stockholder Nominee ) to the Board of Directors by one or more Eligible Stockholders (as defined below) that satisfies the requirements of this Section 5(g), and expressly elects at the time of providing the written  
  
   13 

notice required by this Section 5(g) (a  Proxy Access Notice ) to have its nominee included in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 5(g). 
  (2)        For the purposes of this Section 5(g): 
  (A)         Voting Stock  shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors; 
  (B)         Constituent Holder  shall mean any stockholder, collective investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined below) or beneficial holder whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined below) or qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder; and 
  (C)        a stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to  own  only those outstanding shares of Voting Stock as to which the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) possesses both (a) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares.  The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the stockholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder s or Constituent Holder s (or either s affiliates) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or either s affiliate), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index.  A stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall  own  shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with  
  
   14 

respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares.   A stockholder s (including any Constituent Holder s) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the stockholder has loaned such shares and retained the unrestricted right to recall such shares upon giving no more than five days  notice or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement and such delegation is revocable at any time by the stockholder (and otherwise  owned  as defined herein) through the annual meeting.  The terms  owned,   owning  and other variations of the word  own  shall have correlative meanings. 
  (3)        For purposes of this Section 5(g), the  Required Information  that the Corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that the Corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the Corporation s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The Corporation shall also include the name of the Stockholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these By-Laws notwithstanding, the Corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Stockholder and/or Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the Corporation with respect to the foregoing. 
  (4)        To be timely, a stockholder s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date the corporation issued its definitive proxy statement for the preceding year s annual meeting.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the public announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of notice by a stockholder as described above. 
  (5)        The maximum number of Stockholder Nominees (including Stockholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 5(g) but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as a nominee of the Board of Directors or otherwise appoint to the Board) appearing in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) 2 and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the methods prescribed for delivery of notice in this Section 5(g) (such greater number, the  Permitted Number  provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by: 
  
   15 

(A)        the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the Corporation), other than any such director referred to in this Section 5(g)(5)(A) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) annual terms; and 
  (B)        the number of directors in office that will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the Corporation s proxy materials was previously requested or provided pursuant to this Section 5(g), other than any such director referred to in this Section 5(g)(5)(B) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) annual terms; provided, further, that in the event the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. 
    An Eligible Stockholder submitting more than one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to this Section 5(g) shall rank such Stockholder Nominees based on the order that the Eligible Stockholder desires such Stockholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement and include such specified rank in its Proxy Access Notice.  If the number of Stockholder Nominees pursuant to this Section 5(g) for an annual meeting of stockholders exceeds the Permitted Number, then the highest ranking qualifying Stockholder Nominee from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected by the Corporation for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the ownership position as disclosed in each Eligible Stockholder s Proxy Access Notice.  If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee from each Eligible Stockholder has been selected, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached. 
  (6)        An  Eligible Stockholder  is one or more stockholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least 3 years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 5(g), and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least 3% of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the  Proxy Access Request Required Shares ), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the Corporation and  
  
   16 

the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and, if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed 25.  Two or more collective investment funds that are part of the same family of funds by virtue of being under common management and investment control or sponsored by the same employer (a  Qualifying Fund ) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of stockholders in this Section 5(g)(6), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this Section 5(g).  No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this Section 5(g) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder or affiliate thereof may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder).  A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this Section 5(g), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder s holdings.  For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the 3-year period ending on that date and through the other applicable dates referred to above (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met). 
  (7)        No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice may be timely delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 5(g) of this Article IV, an Eligible Stockholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide, with respect to themselves and its Stockholder Nominee(s), the information required to be disclosed under Section 5(a)(3) of this Article IV in a stockholder s notice and must provide the following information in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation: 
  (A)        with respect to each Constituent Holder, the name and address of, and number of shares of Voting Stock owned by such person; 
  (B)        one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three 3-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within 7 calendar days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the Corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding 3 years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person s agreement to provide: 
  
   17 

(C)        within 10 days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person s continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person s ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and 
  (D)        immediate notice if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting of stockholders; 
  (E)        a representation that such person: 
  (i)        acquired the Proxy Access Request Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control of the Corporation, and does not presently have such intent; 
  (ii)        has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the Board of Directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Stockholder Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this Section 5(g); 
  (iii)        has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a  participant  in another person s,  solicitation  within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(1) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual meeting other than its Stockholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors; 
  (iv)        will not distribute to any stockholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the Corporation; and 
  (v)        will provide facts, statements, and other information in all communications with the Corporation and its stockholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section 5(g); 
  (F)        in the case of a nomination by a group of stockholders that together is such an Eligible Stockholder, the designation by all group members of one group member that is authorized to act on behalf of  
  
   18 

all members of the nominating stockholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and 
  (G)        an undertaking that such person agrees to: 
  (i)        assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation and each of its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Stockholder s communications with the stockholders of the Corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Stockholder (including such person) provided to the Corporation; 
  (ii)        promptly provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may reasonably request; and 
  (iii)        file with the Securities and Exchange Commission any solicitation by the Eligible Stockholder of stockholders of the Corporation relating to the annual meeting at which the Stockholder Nominee will be nominated. 
    In addition, no later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this Section 5(g) may be timely delivered to the Corporation, a Qualifying Fund whose stock ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder must provide to the Secretary of the Corporation documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors that demonstrates that the funds included within the Qualifying Fund satisfy the criteria specified in the definition of Qualifying Fund. 
    In order to be considered timely, any information required by this Section 5(g) to be provided to the Corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation) (1) no later than five (5) business days after the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than eight (8) business days prior to the date of the annual meeting, any adjournment or postponement thereof, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to such annual meeting.  For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Stockholder or other person to change or add any proposed Stockholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these By-Laws) available to the Corporation relating to any defect. 
  
   19 

(8)        The Eligible Stockholder may provide to the Secretary of the Corporation, at the time the information required by this Section 5(g) is originally provided, a single written statement for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed 500 words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Stockholder s Stockholder Nominee(s) (the  Statement ).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5(g), the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state any material fact, directly or indirectly (in each case without factual foundation), impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of any person or makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations with respect to any person or would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
  (9)        No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this Section 5(g) may be timely delivered to the Corporation, each Stockholder Nominee must provide a completed and signed nominee questionnaire, representation and agreement, as required by Section 6 of this Article IV and must provide such additional information as necessary to permit the Board of Directors to determine if any of the matters contemplated by Section 5(g)(10) apply and if such Stockholder Nominee has any direct or indirect relationship with the Corporation other than those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to the Corporation s Corporate Governance Guidelines or is or has been subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Each Stockholder Nominee shall also promptly provide to the Corporation such other information as may be reasonably requested by the Corporation of the Stockholder Nominee.  In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or the Stockholder Nominee to the Corporation or its stockholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Corporation of any defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these By-Laws) available to the Corporation relating to any such defect. 
  (10)        Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of stockholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this Section 5(g) or any other provision of these By-Laws, the Restated Articles of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of stockholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of stockholders.

  ARTICLE V 
  Directors 
  Section 1.          Board of Directors 
  a.        Number, election and terms 
    Except as otherwise fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article III of the Restated Articles of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of the directors of the Corporation shall be 13, but such number may be fixed from  
  
   22 

time to time at not less than three nor more than 21 by resolution of the Board of Directors.  The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible.  Such classes shall originally consist of one class of four directors who shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 1984 for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1985; a second class of three directors who shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 1984 for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1986; and a third class of four directors who shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 1984 for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1987.  The Board of Directors shall increase or decrease the number of directors in one or more classes as may be appropriate whenever it increases or decreases the number of directors pursuant to this Article V, in order to ensure that the three classes shall be as nearly equal in number as possible.  At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election.  Commencing in 2016, directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders following their election.  Accordingly, at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders; at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders; and at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders following the year of their election.  All directors, subject to such director s earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected, and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. 
  b.        Stockholder nomination of director candidates 
    Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors shall be given in the manner provided in Section 5 of Article IV of these By-Laws. 
  c.        Newly created directorships and vacancies 
    Except as otherwise provided for or fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article III of the Restated Articles of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a  
  
   23 

preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or any other cause shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors.  Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office until the next election of directors by the stockholders and until such director s successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.  No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.  If a director resigns, effective at a future date, such director may vote to fill the vacancy. 
  d.        Removal 
    Subject to the rights of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, any director may be removed from office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy) by the holders of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.  For purposes of clarity,  abstentions,   withheld  votes and  broker non-votes  shall not be counted as a vote cast with respect to such action.  
  Section 2.          Notification of Nominations 
    Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a proxy committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally.  However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if such nominee or nominees shall have met all applicable requirements and procedures in being placed in nomination and considered for election, including without limitation the requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Section 5 and Section 6 of Article IV of these By-Laws and in all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

  Section 3.          Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement of Costs, Charges and Expenses 
    Any indemnification or advancement of costs, charges and expenses under this Article shall be made promptly and in any event within sixty (60) days upon the written request of the Indemnified Person.  The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Person in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request under this Article, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within sixty (60) days.  Such Indemnified Person s costs, charges and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.  It shall be a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct, if any, required by current or future legislation or by current or future judicial or administrative decisions for indemnification (but, in the case of any such future legislation or decisions, only to the extent that it does not impose a more stringent standard of conduct than permitted prior to such legislation or decisions), but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
  
   35 

Section 4.        Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Costs, Charges and Expenses; Contractual Nature 
    The indemnification, and the right to advancement of costs, charges and expenses, provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or recommendation of counsel or otherwise, both as to actions in such person s official capacity and as to actions in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and estate of such person.  The Board of Directors shall have the authority, by resolution, to provide for such indemnification of, and such advancement of costs, charges and expenses to, employees or agents of the Corporation or others and for such other indemnification of, and such other advancement of costs, charges and expenses to, directors, officers, employees or agents as it shall deem appropriate. 
           All rights to indemnification and to advancement of costs, charges and expenses, under this Article shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Indemnified Person who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is in effect.  Any repeal or modification of this Article or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of Florida corporation law or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of, or to advancement of costs, charges and expenses to, such Indemnified Person, or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder, then existing or arising out of events, acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification, including without limitation, the right to indemnification with respect to Proceedings commenced after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article XII with regard to Proceedings arising out of acts, omissions or events arising prior to such repeal or modification for claims relating to matters occurring prior to such repeal or modification. 
  Section 5.        Insurance, Contracts and Funding 
    The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including serving as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan), against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article XII or the applicable provisions of Florida law.  The Corporation may enter into contracts with any director, officer, agent or employee of the Corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Article XII, and may create a trust fund, grant a security  
  
   36 

interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect the advancing of expenses and indemnification as provided in this Article XII. 
  Section 6.        Savings Clause 
    If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated or held to be unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of which shall not have been reversed on appeal, then the Corporation shall nevertheless (i) indemnify each Indemnified Person as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys  fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and (ii) advance costs, charges and expenses in accordance with Section 2 of this Article XII, in each case with respect to any Proceeding in connection with which he or she is an Indemnified Person, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated or held to be unenforceable and as permitted by applicable law. 
  ARTICLE XIII 
  By-Law Amendment 
    Except as otherwise provided in the Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, alter, amend and repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation (except insofar as the By-Laws of the Corporation adopted by the stockholders shall otherwise provide).  Any By-Laws made by the stockholders may prescribe that they may not be altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.  Any By-Laws made by the Board of Directors under the powers conferred hereby and by the Restated Articles of Incorporation may be altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders.  Amendments to the By-Laws (including any amendment to this Article XIII) shall be effected as follows: 
  a.        By Action of the Board of Directors 
    Unless a greater vote is specifically required by the laws of the State of Florida, or a greater or different vote or a vote of stockholders is required by the provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may alter, amend or repeal these By-Laws, or adopt such other By-Laws as in their judgment may be advisable for the administration or regulation of the management and affairs of the Corporation, to the extent not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Florida or the Restated Articles of Incorporation, only upon the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the total number of directors as fixed in accordance with Section 1 of Article V of these By-Laws. 
  
   37 

b.        By Action of the Stockholders 
    Unless a greater vote is specifically required by the laws of the State of Florida, or a greater or different vote is required by the provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation, the stockholders may alter, amend or repeal these By-Laws, or adopt such other By-Laws as in their judgment may be advisable for the administration or regulation of the management and affairs of the Corporation, to the extent not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Florida or the Restated Articles of Incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders (or at any special meeting thereof duly called for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of these By-Laws), only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy) by the holders of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.  For purposes of clarity,  abstentions,   withheld  votes and  broker non-votes  shall not be counted as a vote cast with respect to such action.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything contained in these By-Laws to the contrary, Section 4 of Article IV of these By-Laws shall not be altered, amended or repealed and no provision inconsistent therewith shall be adopted without the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 
  ARTICLE XIV 
  Continuing Effect of By-Law Provisions 
    Any provision contained in these By-Laws which, at the time of its adoption, was authorized or permitted by applicable law shall continue to remain in full force and effect until such time as such provision is specifically amended in accordance with these By-Laws, notwithstanding any subsequent modification of such applicable law (except to the extent such By-Law provision expressly provides for its modification by or as a result of any such subsequently enacted law).
