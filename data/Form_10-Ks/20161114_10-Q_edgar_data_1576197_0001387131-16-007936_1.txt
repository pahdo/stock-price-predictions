NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION  

Organization and Going Concern  

Strategic Environmental   Energy Resources,
Inc. ( SEER,   we,  or the  Company ), a Nevada corporation, is a provider of next-generation
clean-technologies, waste management innovations and related services. SEER has four wholly-owned operating subsidiaries and two
majority-owned subsidiaries; all of which together provide technology solutions and services to companies primarily in the oil
and gas, refining, landfill, food, beverage   agriculture and renewable fuel industries. The four wholly-owned subsidiaries
include: 1) REGS, LLC (d/b/a Resource Environmental Group Services ( REGS )) provides industrial and proprietary cleaning
services to refineries, oil fields and other private and governmental entities; 2) Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC ( Tactical ),
provides proprietary cleaning services related to railcar tankers, tank trucks and frac tanks to customers from its sites in Colorado
and Kansas; 3) MV, LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies) ( MV ), designs and builds biogas conditioning solutions for the production
of renewable natural gas and odor control systems primarily for landfill operations, waste-water treatment facilities, oil and
gas fields, refineries, municipalities and food, beverage   agriculture operations throughout the U.S.; 4) SEER Environmental
Materials, LLC,( SEM ), a materials technology company focused on development of cost-effective chemical absorbents. 

The two majority-owned subsidiaries include;
1) Paragon Waste Solutions, LLC ( PWS ) and 2) ReaCH4Biogas ( Reach ). PWS is currently owned 54% by SEER
(see Note 7) and Reach is owned 85% by SEER. 

PWS is developing specific opportunities
to deploy and commercialize patented technologies for a non-thermal plasma-assisted oxidation process that makes possible the clean
and efficient destruction of solid hazardous chemical and biological waste ( i.e ., regulated medical waste, chemicals, pharmaceuticals
and refinery tank waste,  etc .) without landfilling or traditional incineration and without harmful emissions. Additionally,
PWS  technology  cleans  and conditions emissions and gaseous waste streams ( i.e ., volatile organic compounds
and other greenhouse gases) generated from diverse sources such as refineries, oil fields, and many others. 

Reach (the trade name for BeneFuels, LLC),
is currently owned 85% by SEER and focuses specifically on developing renewable biomethane projects that convert raw biogas to
pipeline quality gas and/or compressed natural gas ( CNG ) for fleet vehicle fuel. Reach had minimal operations for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Principals of Consolidation  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of SEER, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, REGS, TCC, MV and SEM and its majority-owned subsidiaries
PWS and Reach, since their respective acquisition or formation dates. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has non-controlling interest in joint ventures, which are reported on the equity
method. 

Going Concern  

As shown in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has accumulated a deficit of approximately $16.8 million
as of September 30, 2016, and $15.4 million as of December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had net loss
before adjustment for losses attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately $1.7 million and for the years ended December
31, 2015, and 2014, we incurred net losses before adjustment for losses attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately
$3.4 million and $726,000, respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $3.2 million at September 30,
2016, an increase of approximately $500,000 in the working capital deficit of $2.7 million at December 31, 2015. REGS, a wholly
owned subsidiary, was notified that effective April 1, 2016 it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its
largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. The projected loss of revenue from
this customer is estimated to be between $2.5 and $3 million annually, but, as discussed below, the Company has implemented remedial
measures to offset some of this loss in revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue
to operate as a going concern.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION, continued  

Going Concern, continued  

Realization of a major portion of our assets
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating
additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. The Company opened an additional
rail car cleaning facility in the Midwest (Illinois) in April 2016 and operations have commenced and revenue is being generated.
The revenue from this facility has offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the oil refinery sector. Additionally,
on August 30, 2016 the Company was awarded a permit for its flaring equipment at its Kansas rail facility and this new service
offering is projected to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the oil refinery sector. Revenue from
flaring operations commenced in September 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we raised $425,000 from the sale of
common stock and exercise of warrants and another $29,900 from the extension of warrants. In September 2016, we raised $250,000
in convertible debt financing. In addition, we have undertaken a number of specific steps to improve operating efficiencies, revenues
and income to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies
and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions.
Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate our CoronaLux  waste destruction
units either though our joint ventures and/or licensees. We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities
identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations, particularly
the landfill gas and oil field emissions sectors. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be
available to it, i.e., debt and/or equity financing while carefully evaluating the impact on share dilution. There can be no assurance
that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net
income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments
that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis. 

Basis of Presentation - Unaudited Interim Financial Information  

The accompanying
interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements contain all of the normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position
and results of operations as of and for the periods presented. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the full year or any future period . 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the interim information presented not misleading.
These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto included in the Company s Report on Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016 for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to
make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of intangible assets; valuation
allowances and reserves for receivables and inventory and deferred income taxes; revenue recognition related to contracts accounted
for under the percentage of completion method; share-based compensation; and loss contingencies, including those related to litigation.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassifications  

Certain amounts in the prior period financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported
consolidated net income (loss). 

Research and Development  

Research and development ( R D )
costs are charged to expense as incurred. R D expenses consist primarily of salaries, project materials, contract labor and
other costs associated with ongoing product development and enhancement efforts. R D expenses were $49,100 and $80,900 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $149,100 and $279,700 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant
to  Accounting Standards Codification  ( ASC ) 740,  Income Taxes,  which utilizes the asset and liability
method of computing deferred income taxes. The objective of this method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for
any temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities
at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. 

ASC 740 also provides detailed guidance
for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements.
Tax positions must meet a  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. During
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized no adjustments for uncertain tax positions. 

The Company recognizes interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were recognized
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company expects no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next
twelve months. 

The Company has filed federal and state
tax returns through December 31, 2015. The tax periods for the years ending December 31, 2008 through 2015 are open to examination
by federal and state authorities.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued  

Recently issued accounting pronouncements  

Changes to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the
form of accounting standards updates (ASU s) to the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers
the applicability and impact of all new or revised ASU s. 

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued guidance creating Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Section 606,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers .  The new section will replace Section 605,  Revenue Recognition  and creates modifications
to various other revenue accounting standards for specialized transactions and industries.  The section is intended to conform
revenue accounting principles with a concurrently issued International Financial Reporting Standards with previously differing
treatment between United States practice and those of much of the rest of the world, as well as, to enhance disclosures related
to disaggregated revenue information.  The updated guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay of
the effective date. The Company will now adopt the new provisions of this accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018,
unless it choose to early adopt in 2017.  The Company will further study the implications of this statement in order to evaluate
the expected impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  Under this ASU, inventory will be measured at the  lower of cost
and net realizable value  and options that currently exist for  market value  will be eliminated. The ASU defines
net realizable value as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs
of completion, disposal, and transportation.  No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement.
ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and should
be applied prospectively. Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement, including which period to adopt, and has not
determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations .  

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts. The amendments will require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments may be applied
either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is in
the process of evaluating this guidance. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
( ASU 2016-01 ), which requires that (i) all equity investments, other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated
entities generally be measured at fair value through earnings and (ii) when the fair value option has been elected for financial
liabilities, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive
income. Additionally, the ASU 2016-01 changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The new standard will be effective
for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is
in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to
adopt certain provisions early.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES, continued  

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance
related to leases that outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance. The new guidance
requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms of greater
than 12 months. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The
new guidance must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for the Company starting in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will
have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt the new guidance early. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
( ASU 2016-09 ), which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 includes provisions
intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.
ASU 2016-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of
the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.  

Recently Adopted Accounting
Standards  

In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-12,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the
terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period,  ( ASU 2014-12 ).
Current U.S. GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the
requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting condition that affects the grant-date
fair value of an award. The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after
the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in
estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The updated guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and did not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for the first interim period for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2015. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements. 

In September 2015, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-16,  Simplifying the
Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . The new guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for
adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. Under the ASU, the adjustments to the provisional amounts
will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The updated guidance will be effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance was effective
January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 7  INVESTMENT IN PARAGON WASTE SOLUTIONS LLC  

In 2010, the Company and Black Stone Management
Services, LLC ( Black Stone ) formed PWS, whereby a total of 1,000,000 membership units were issued, 600,000 membership
units to the Company and 400,000 membership units to Black Stone. Fortunato Villamagna, who serves as President of our PWS subsidiary,
is a managing member and Chairman of Black Stone. In June 2012, the Company and Blackstone each allocated 10% of their respective
membership units in PWS to Mr. J John Combs III, an officer and shareholder of the Company and Mr. Michael Cardillo, a shareholder
of the Company and an officer of a subsidiary. There was no value attributable to the units at the time of the allocation. On August
31, 2016 Blackstone entered into a settlement agreement with a third party to rescind a stock exchange agreement dated July 1,
2013 between Blackstone and the third party and consideration exchanged by the parties in the July 1, 2013 agreement were returned
by each party resulting in Blackstone getting back 10% membership units in PWS. At September 30, 2016 the Company owned 54% of
the membership units, Black Stone owned 36% of the membership units and two related parties (as noted above), each owned 5% of
the membership units. 

In August, 2011, we acquired certain intellectual
property in regards to waste destruction technology (the  IP ) from Black Stone in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of
our common stock valued at $100,000. We estimated the useful life of the IP at ten years, which was consistent with the useful
life of other technology included in our intangible assets, and management s initial assessment of the potential marketability
of the IP. 

In April 2016, the Company received Notice
of Allowance of its application for a continuation patent. This patent continuation application incorporates all original and prior
claims and will provide expanded and additional protection of the underlying and core waste destruction technology. 

In March 2012, the Company entered into
an Irrevocable License   Royalty Agreement with PWS that grants PWS an irrevocable world-wide license to the IP in exchange
for a 5% royalty on all revenues from PWS and its affiliates. The term commenced as of the date of the Agreement and shall continue
for a period not to exceed the life of the patent or patents filed by the Company. PWS may sub license the IP and any revenue derived
from sub licensing shall be included in the calculation of Gross Revenue for purposes of determining royalty payments due the Company.
Royalty payments are due 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. PWS generated licensing revenues and sales of CoronaLux 
units of approximately $125,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $890,100 for the year ended December 31, 2015,
as such, royalties of $54,700 and $48,400 were due at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Since its inception through September 30,
2016, we have provided approximately $5.5 million in funding to PWS for working capital and the further development and construction
of various prototypes and commercial waste destruction units. No members of PWS have made capital contributions or other funding
to PWS other than SEER.

The intent of the operating agreement is
that we will provide the funding as an advance against future earnings distributions made by PWS. 

Licensing Agreements  

In September 2013, PWS entered into an
Exclusive Use License and Joint Operations Agreement ( License Agreement ) with Sterall Inc. ( Sterall ).
The License Agreement granted Sterall the use of the PWS Technology and the CoronaLux  waste destruction units for an initial
five year term in the State of Florida and renewable for two additional five year terms, for the treatment and/or destruction of
any and all regulated medical waste from any sources. The agreement required Sterall to pay a $300,000 License Initiation Fee and
in order for Sterall to maintain its exclusive license for the State of Florida, a total of $200,000 was to be paid to PWS by May
23, 2014, regardless of net operating profits of Sterall ( NOP ). During the initial 5-year term, a minimum of $500,000
of total royalty payments to PWS must be made either from NOP or otherwise (in addition to the $300,000 Initial Fee, set forth
below), in order for the second-phase five-year term to be exclusive. During the second-phase five-year term, a minimum of $750,000
of royalty must be paid, out of NOP or otherwise, in order for the third phase five-year term to be exclusive. PWS will receive
a one-time license initiation fee of $300,000 payable from NOP of Sterall as a priority payment before any other distributions
or payouts. Sterall can take delivery of additional CoronaLux  waste destruction units upon payment of a placement fee per
unit of either $168,000 or $207,000 depending upon the size of the unit. The unit placement fees do not include freight, start-up
and commissioning costs, which shall be borne by the facility. PWS, at its sole discretion will select the installation, startup
and commissioning teams. Sterall has not generated any NOP and has not paid any licensing fees to PWS as required by the License
Agreement, including the minimum payments required under the agreement. Black Stone is a minority shareholder of Sterall. 

During the year ended December 31, 2014,
Sterall ordered a total of six CoronaLux  units, of which one unit was delivered after payment of a non-refundable placement
fee of $236,250. The remaining five units have not been delivered as of September 30, 2016 as Sterall has defaulted on their purchase
order for payment of the units ordered. The Company still retains a non-refundable deposit of $330,000 against the five units ordered. 

On February 22, 2014, SEER and PWS entered
into an Agreement with Daniel McAteer   Associates ( DMA ) to develop, permit and exploit the PWS waste destruction
technology in Ireland and United Kingdom ( Limited Territory ). The Agreement called for the formation of a Joint Venture
to be owned 50% by SEER and 50% by DMA. In accordance with the agreement, DMA was to pay a one-time license fee of $350,000 for
an exclusive license for the limited purpose of medical waste destruction in the Limited Territory. On June 10, 2014 Paragon Waste
(UK) Ltd ( Paragon UK ,  UK Joint Venture ), was formed in accordance with the laws of Northern Ireland.
A total of 300,100 shares were issued upon formation, 100 Ordinary A voting shares were issued, of which PWS received 50 Ordinary
A shares and 300,000 Ordinary B non-voting shares were issued. In 2015, the Agreement with DMA was amended to where Paragon UK
purchased the CoronaLux  unit from PWS for $350,000. Operations to date of the Paragon UK Joint Venture have been limited
to formation, the delivery of a CoronaLux  unit with a third party in the United Kingdom and application and permitting efforts
with regulatory entities. 

On March 4, 2014, PWS entered into a Licensing
and Equipment Lease Agreement with eCycling International of South Carolina, LLC ( eCycling ). The License Agreement
grants to eCycling the use of the PWS Technology and the CoronaLux  waste destruction units for an initial term of five years
and requires a payment of $176,875 as a non-refundable initial licensing fee and distributions of 50% of net operating profits,
as defined in the agreement, in lieu of continuing royalty payments for the use of the licensed technology. As of September 30,
2016, eCycling is still in the process of permitting the unit, and therefore, has not yet generated any NOP. As a result of eCycling
not generating any NOP, their licensing contract was amended to provide for an additional $176,875 to be paid as licensing fees,
all of which has been paid as of September 30, 2016.

On November 17, 2014, PWS entered into
an Exclusive Licensing and Equipment Lease Agreement, for a limited license territory, with Medical Waste Services, LLC ( MWS ).
The License Agreement grants to MWS the use of the PWS Technology and the CoronaLux  waste destruction units for an initial
term of seven years and requires a payment of $225,000 as a non-refundable initial licensing fee and distributions of 50% of net
operating profits, as defined in the agreement, in lieu of continuing royalty payments for the use of the licensed technology.
PWS and Medical Waste Services, LLC ( MWS ) formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction
technology. MWS has received approval from the California Department of Public Health and a restricted permit from the South Coast
Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD ) to operate the CoronaLux  unit licensed by MWS at its facility in
Southern California. Operations to date have included the destruction of medical waste under this temporary operating permit issued
by SCAQMD since May 2015. All required testing directed by SCAQMD has been successfully completed in 2016 and all required filings
have been made to obtain a full operating permit from SCAQMD. The final issuance is pending. 

In February 2015, PWS entered into a License
Agreement with Particle Science Tech of Environmental Protection, Inc ( Particle ) a US subsidiary of Xinhua Energy
Environmental Technology Co., Ltd ( Xinhua ), a large multi-national environmental company based in China. The agreement
provides for the exclusive rights to distribute PWS s patented technology in China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Taiwan territories
( Territory ). The grant was for both the medical waste, as well as the refinery vertical markets within the Territory.
The Agreement calls for, among other things, the formation of a U.S. joint venture company, ( P P Company ), to
be owned 50/50 by PWS and Particle) and an obligation by Xinhua to fund all necessary and reasonable capital requirements to permit
and roll out the PWS technology in the Territory as well as staff and manage the JV Entity s operations. In 2015, PWS sold
a CoronaLux  unit to Xinhua for $430,500. 

Upon the occurrence of certain events and
timely performance by Xinhua, a second placement fee of $350,000 is required to be paid and, upon that second payment, it will
then be granted exclusive manufacturing rights to produce the units to be deployed in the Territory. 

Payments received for non-refundable licensing
and placement fees have been recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 and are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract. 

NOTE 8 - PAYROLL TAXES PAYABLE  

In 2009 and 2010, REGS, a subsidiary of
the Company, became delinquent for unpaid federal employer and employee payroll taxes, accrued interest and penalties were incurred
related to these unpaid payroll taxes. 

In or around 2010, REGS retained Washington
D.C.-based legal counsel specializing in resolving federal tax matters. REGS has been represented by this firm throughout all phases
of this tax matter and related proceedings. In September 2011, REGS received approval from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS )
to begin paying the outstanding federal payroll tax liability plus the related incurred interest and penalties totaling approximately
$971,000 in installments (the  Installment Plan ). Under the Installment Plan, REGS was required to pay minimum monthly
installments of $12,500 commencing September 2011, which increased to $25,000 per month in September 2012, until the liability
was paid in full. Through the duration of the Installment Plan, the IRS continues to charge penalties and interest at statutory
rates. If the conditions of the Installment Plan were not met, the IRS could cancel the installment plan and could demand the outstanding
liability to be repaid through traditional enforcement proceedings available to the IRS. Additionally, the IRS has filed a notice
of federal tax lien against certain of REGS assets in order to secure the obligation. The IRS is to release this lien if and when
we pay the full amount due. 

Two of the officers of REGS also have personal
liability exposure for a portion of the taxes if REGS does not pay them. For the tax periods 2009 through 2014, one of the officers
of REGS has had personal income tax refunds totaling $34,262 seized by the IRS and applied to REGS IRS obligation.

NOTE 8 - PAYROLL TAXES PAYABLE, continued  

In May 2013, REGS filed an Offer in Compromise
( OIC ) with the IRS. While the OIC was under review by the IRS, the requirement to pay $25,000 a month under the Installment
Plan was suspended. REGS was informed by its legal counsel that the IRS had accepted REGS  OIC. However by a letter dated
March 27, 2014, REGS was notified that the OIC had been rejected. REGS then appealed that rejections decision. However that appeal
has been denied. As a result, the Installment Plan is terminated. In June 2014, REGS received notices of intent to levy property
or rights to property from the IRS for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes, penalty and interest. The IRS has not taken
any current action against REGS and REGS continues to be represented by its legal counsel. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the outstanding balance due to the IRS was $987,600, and $970,500, respectively. 

Other than this outstanding payroll tax
matter arising in 2009, all state and federal taxes have been paid by REGS in a timely manner. 

NOTE 9   DEBT  

In June 2011, we issued an unsecured promissory
note to a third party in the amount of $40,000 (the  June 2011 Note ) bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum and
a three year warrant to purchase 13,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. In addition, a second
note payable, to the same third party, in the amount of $25,000 plus $3,000 of accrued interest was also converted into the June
2011 Note, resulting in a new principal balance of $68,000. We valued the warrant at $170 using the Black-Scholes model and recorded
this amount as a debt discount. The debt discount was fully amortized during 2011. In August 2016, the note and all accrued interest
was paid by an offset to trade accounts receivable from the note holder.

NOTE 9   DEBT, continued  

In May 2016, the Company borrowed $200,000
in a short term financing arrangement. As an inducement to enter into the transaction the Company issued 500,000 warrants exercisable
at $.50 per share for a period of four years. The warrants were valued at $97,200 and were recorded as additional interest. The
short term debt was repaid in cash in June 2016 along with interest of $12,000. 

In connection with the issuance of convertible
debt on September 30, 2016, the Company issued 50,000 warrants as an inducement to enter into the transaction. The warrants are
exercisable for five years at $.85 per share and were valued at $4,900 using the Black Scholes valuation method and are being amortized
over the term of the debt.

Notes payable, related parties  

Related parties payable and accrued interest
due to certain related parties as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

We believe the stated interest rates on
the related party notes payable represent reasonable market rates based on the note payable arrangements we have executed with
third parties. 

In March 2012, the Company entered into
an Irrevocable License   Royalty Agreement with PWS that grants PWS an irrevocable world-wide license to the IP in exchange
for a 5% royalty on all revenues from PWS and its affiliates. The term shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall
continue for a period not to exceed the life of the patent or patents filed by the Company. PWS may sub license the IP and any
revenue derived from sub licensing shall be included in the calculation of Gross Revenue for purposes of determining royalty payments
due the Company. Royalty payments are due 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. PWS generated licensing revenues and
sales of CoronaLux  units of approximately $125,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $890,500 for the year
ended December 31, 2015, as such, royalties of $54,700 and $48,400 were due at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

In August 2014, the Company entered into
a second Exchange and Acquisition Agreement ( New Technologies Agreement ) with Black Stone for the acquisition of additional
intellectual property ( IP ) from Black Stone in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $1,050,000.
In 2015 the Company and Black Stone executed a rescission agreement of the New Technologies Agreement noted above that was effective
December 31, 2014. The shares issued by the Company in accordance with the agreement were returned and all acquired IP returned
to Black Stone. 

In October 2014, PWS and Medical
Waste Services, LLC ( MWS ) formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology.
In 2015, MWS licensed and installed a CoronaLux  unit at an MWS facility, and subsequently received a limited permit to operate.
Operations to date have included the destruction of medical waste. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 PWS have recorded
$15,700 in income which represents their 50% interest in the net income of the joint venture. In addition, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, PWS billed the joint venture approximately $90,600 in costs incurred on behalf of the joint venture.

NOTE 10   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, continued  

In September 2014, the Company entered
into an Equity Purchase Agreement ( Equity Agreement ) with a third party ( Seller ) whereby the Company issued
1,200,000 shares of the Company s common stock, valued at $1,212,000, in exchange for 22.5 membership interest units, representing
15% ownership interest in Sterall, LLC, a Delaware corporation. In March 2015 the Company and the Seller entered into a revised
agreement whereby the 1,200,000 shares issued by the Company would be held by the Seller until the completion of an independent
third party valuation. The determination of fair value shall occur by December 31, 2015. Based on the fair market value of the
Purchased Units from the valuation obtained by the Company, an amount of Consideration Shares will be returned to the Company to
the extent that the fair market value of the Consideration Shares issued (see below) are greater than the fair market value of
the Purchased Units. In no event shall the Company be obligated to issue additional shares as consideration for the Purchased Units.
For purposes of this amendment, the fair market value of each Consideration Share as determined to be $0.83333. In the event the
parties are unwilling to accept the fair market value of the Purchased Units, as determined by the independent valuation specialist,
on or before the Closing Date (December 31, 2015) this Agreement, the transaction covered by this Agreement (the  Contemplated
Transaction ) may be rescinded by either Party in writing. Due to the ability of the Company to rescind the shares issued
at the commencement of the transaction the shares were considered contingently issuable shares and as such the 1,200,000 share
not considered issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. The 15% ownership interest in Sterall was considered contingently held
until the conclusion of this transaction. 

As of December 31, 2015 an independent
appraisal was not performed and the Amended Equity Agreement expired by its terms. The 1,200,000 shares subject to the original
Equity Agreement and the Amended Equity Agreement became unrestricted in 2016 and are now considered issued and outstanding. The
shares were valued at $720,000 and have been recorded as a long term other asset pending resolution of claims by the parties involved
related to the Sterall licensing agreement from September 2013, Sterall equipment deposits of $330,000 from 2014 and the equity
purchase agreement noted above. The ultimate resolution of the various claims by the parties and the ultimate disposition of the
$720,000 are expected to be resolved no later than December 31, 2016.

Non-controlling Interest  

The non-controlling interest presented
in our condensed consolidated financial statements reflects a 46% non-controlling equity interest in PWS (see Note 7). Net loss
attributable to non-controlling interest, as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, represents the net
loss of PWS attributable to the non-controlling equity interest. The non-controlling interest is reflected within stockholders 
equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

NOTE 12   CUSTOMER
CONCENTRATIONS  

The Company had sales from operations to
two customers for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 that represented approximately 38% and 49%, respectively of
our total sales and sales from operations to one customer for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that represented approximately
22% and sales from operations to two customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 that represented approximately 49%,
respectively, of our total sales. The concentration of the Company s business with a relatively small number of customers
may expose us to a material adverse effect if one or more of these large customers were to experience financial difficulty or were
to cease being customer for non-financial related issues. REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary, was notified that effective April 1,
2016 it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide
other industrial cleaning services. The projected loss of revenue from this customer is estimated to be between $2.5 and $3 million
annually. 

NOTE 13   NET LOSS PER SHARE  

Basic net loss per share is computed by
dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive common
shares. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation when their effect would be anti-dilutive. For all years
presented in the consolidated financial statements, all potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the diluted share
calculations as they were anti-dilutive as a result of the net losses incurred for the respective years. Accordingly, basic shares
equal diluted shares for all years presented. 

Potentially dilutive securities were comprised of the following:

NOTE 14 - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND
REGULATION  

Significant federal environmental laws
affecting us are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act ( CERCLA ), also known as the  Superfund Act , the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and
the Toxic Substances Control Act ( TSCA ). 

Pursuant to the EPA s authorization
of the RCRA equivalent programs, a number of states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous
waste facilities. Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water and clean air.
Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land use restrictions. We believe we are in substantial compliance
with all federal, state and local laws regulating our business. 

NOTE 15   LITIGATION  

In March 2016, a complaint was filed
by a lessor of property leased by REGS, a subsidiary of the Company. The month-to-month lease expired February 29, 2016, when
REGS vacated the property. The landlord has made certain claims including property damage, and loss of rents, attorney fees
and other costs totaling approximately $97,000. REGS has engaged defense counsel and intends to zealously oppose the claims.
While the Company s management believes the claims are without merit, the Company has accrued $48,400 as a loss against
this claim. 

In January 2016, an employee of SEM was involved in a vehicle accident while on Company business. The accident
resulted in one fatality and injuries to another party. The two parties filed lawsuits against SEM as a result of the accident
and the claims were turned over to our insurance carrier. Defense counsel was provided for and appointed by the Company s
insurance carrier. In August 2016, both claimants each filed a claim with our insurance carrier for the full amount of our insurance
coverage, approximately $6 million. Later in August 2016, an involuntary proceeding was commenced by one of the claimants against
SEM under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy code by one claimant as a result of both claimants filing for the $6 million in insurance
available under our policies. SEM engaged bankruptcy counsel who filed certain motions on behalf of SEM. In September, the case
was converted to a Chapter 11 under the Bankruptcy code and the Bankruptcy court granted SEM s motion and ordered that the
$6 million in insurance proceeds under our policy would be an asset of the estate of SEM. In October 2016, the Company filed a
plan of reorganization with the court that allows for an equitable split of the $6 million in insurance proceeds, as determined
by the two claimants, and allows for all creditors of SEM, both secured and unsecured, to be paid in full if the two claimants
can come to terms with an equitable allocation of the $6 million in insurance proceeds. At this time SEM continues to manage its
affairs and is currently operating normally. The ultimate outcome of this Chapter 11 proceeding is uncertain at this time. Management
does not currently believe that any assets of SEM are impaired as of September 30, 2016. Operations and production are continuing
uninterupted.

SEER BUSINESS OVERVIEW  

Strategic Environmental
  Energy Resources, Inc. ( the Company  or  SEER ) was originally organized under the laws of the State
of Nevada on February 13, 2002 for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses, under the name of Satellite Organizing Solutions,
Inc ( SOZG ). In January 2008, SOZG changed its name to Strategic Environmental   Energy Resources, Inc., reduced
its number of outstanding shares through a reverse stock split and consummated the acquisition of both, REGS, LLC and Tactical
Cleaning Company, LLC. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that
provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the oil   gas, environmental, waste management and renewable
energy industries. SEER currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and mid-western U.S. Through these operating
companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed technologies with many customer installations
throughout the U.S. Each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below. The Company also has non-controlling
interests in joint ventures, some of which have no or minimal operations. 

The Company s
domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously,
establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy,
waste and water treatment and oil   gas services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however is to increase margins
by securing or developing proprietary patented and patent-pending technologies and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service experience
to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable  green gas 
capture and sale, compressed natural gas ( CNG ) fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical
waste destruction. Many of SEER s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services,
technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams. 

The Company now owns
and manages five operating entities and one entity that has no significant operations to date. 

Subsidiaries  

REGS, LLC  d/b/a Resource
Environmental Group Services ( REGS ):  (operating since 1994)  provides general industrial cleaning services and
waste management to many industry sectors focusing primarily on oil   gas production (upstream) and refineries (downstream). 

Tactical Cleaning Company,
LLC ( Tactical ): (operating since 2005)  provides cleaning services to the tanker rail car industry with offices
in two states and a focus on both food-grade and petroleum based products,  i.e ., fuel oil and asphalt. Tactical has recently
been permitted to operate a flare at its Kansas facility and will be expanding its operations in 2016 to include the cleaning of
gas and propane rail cars. 

MV, LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies),
( MV ) :  (operating since 2003)  MV designs and sells patented and/or proprietary, dry scrubber solutions for
management of Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S) in biogas, landfill gas, and petroleum processing operations. These system solutions
are marketed under the product names H2SPlus  and OdorFilter . The markets for these products include land fill operations,
agricultural and food product processors, wastewater treatment facilities, and petroleum product refiners. MV also develops and
designs proprietary technologies and systems used to condition biogas for use as renewable natural gas ( RNG ), for a
number of applications, such as transportation fuel and natural gas pipeline injection. 

Paragon Waste Solutions,
LLC ( PWS ): (formed late 2010)  PWS is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction technology
using a pyrolytic heating process combined with  non-thermal plasma  assisted oxidation. This technique involves gasification
of solid waste by heating the waste in a low-oxygen environment, followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in the presence
of plasma. The term  non-thermal plasma  refers to a low energy ionized gas that is generated by electrical discharges
between two electrodes. This technology, commercially referred to as CoronaLux , is designed and intended for the  clean 
destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste  (i.e ., hospital  red bag  waste) thereby eliminating
the need for costly segregation, transportation, incineration or landfill (with their associated legacy liabilities). PWS is a
54% owned subsidiary. 

ReaCH4BioGas ( Reach )
(trade name for Benefuels, LLC): (formed February 2013)  owned 85% by SEER. Reach develops renewable natural gas projects that
convert raw biogas into pipeline quality gas and/or Renewable,  RNG , for fleet vehicles. Reach has had minimal operations
as of September 30, 2016 

SEER Environmental Materials,
LLC ( SEM )  formed September 2015. SEM is a wholly owned subsidiary established as a materials technology business
with the purpose of developing advanced chemical absorbents and catalysts that enhance the capability of biogas produced from,
landfill, wastewater treatment operations and agricultural digester operations.

waste destruction technology. In 2015, MWS licensed and installed a CoronaLux  unit at an MWS facility, and subsequently
received a limited permit to operate from the South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD ) and the California
Department of Public Health. Operations to date have included the destruction of medical waste while demonstrating the ultralow
emissions necessary for application of a more expansive operating permit, submitted to SCAQMD in March 2016. 

SEER s Financial Condition  

As shown in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately
$16.8 million $15.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had
net loss before non-controlling interest of $1.7 million. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 our current liabilities
exceed our current assets by approximately $3.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Our total assets exceed total liabilities
at September 30, 2016 by approximately $646,000 and at December 31, 2015 our total assets exceeded our total liabilities by approximately
$1 million. The Company raised $425,000 through the sale of common stock and exercise of common stock warrants for the period January
1, 2016 thru September 30, 2016. In Q1 2016, REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary, was notified that effective April 1, 2016 it would
no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial
cleaning services. The projected loss of revenue from this customer is estimated to be between $2.5 and $3 million annually. The
Company opened an additional rail car cleaning facility in the Midwest (Illinois) in April 2016 to offset some of the lost service
revenue previously derived from the refinery sector. 

Realization of a major
portion of our assets as of September 30, 2016, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating
additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken
a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our
operating companies, diversifying our service customer and market concentrations and improving gross and net margins through increased
attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability
to license and or sell, permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux  waste destruction units.
We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding domestic markets attributable
to increased federal and state emission control regulations (particularly in the nation s oil and gas fields) and a growing
demand and a growing demand for energy conservation and renewable energies. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms
of financing that may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working
capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years.
These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report
on a going concern basis. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Total revenues
were approximately $2.83 million and $2.96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a
decrease of approximately$132,000, or 4%, in revenues. Service segment revenues, which include industrial cleaning and
railcar cleaning was approximately $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $846,000 or 45%. Railcar cleaning revenues decreased
approximately $213,000 or 25% comparing Q3 2016 to Q3 2015and industrial cleaning services revenues decreased
approximately$633,000 or 60% comparing 2016 to 2015. The decline in railcar cleaning services was a reduction in the number
of railcars available for servicing. The primary reason for the decline in industrial cleaning revenue was the loss of
routine maintenance services with our largest customer on April 1, 2016. In Q3 2015 this customer accounted for $649,100 in
industrial cleaning services revenue whereas in Q3 2016 this customer accounted for only $19,700. In April 2016 our
industrial cleaning services segment commenced opening a railcar facility in Illinois and revenue generating operations
commenced May 2016, generating revenues of $249,200 in Q3 2016 to partially offset the loss of industrial service revenues
from our customer noted above. Our environmental solutions segment generated revenue of approximately $1.7 million in 2016
compared to approximately $1 million in 2015, an increase of approximately $784,000 or 81%. The increase is primarily the
result of increased media replacement sales comparing Q3 2016 to Q3 2015 of approximately $100,000 but mostly attributable to
project revenues which increased approximately $662,000. Our solid waste segment generated $42,000 in revenue, mostly
licensing fees, in Q3 2016 compared to $111,500 in Q3 2015. The solid waste disposal segment receives
non-refundable licensing fees which are being recognized as revenue ratably over the initial term of the agreements of
between 5-7 years. 

Operating costs, which
include cost of products, cost of services, solid waste costs, general and administrative (G A) expenses and salaries and related
expenses, were approximately $3.57 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $3.65 million for
the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating costs of approximately $74,000 is primarily the result of a 1)
a 45% decrease in service revenues resulting in a corresponding decrease in service costs of $230,700, 2) a decrease in solid waste
costs of $115,100 primarily attributable to a reduction in labor, travel, freight and other costs incurred in Q3 2015 related to
the startup and commissioning costs of a Coronalux  unit in Paramount, California that stopped once the unit commenced operations
in May 2015, 3) a decrease in general and administrative cost of $136,600, comparing 2016 to 2015, primarily from a decrease in
professional fees, travel and research and development costs, 4) a decrease in salary related costs of $184,000, comparing 2016
to 2015, primarily attributable to a reduction is G A salaries and wages due to a reduction in headcount, offset by, 5) an
increase in product costs of $648,500 as a result of an 81% increase in product revenues. Service costs as a percentage of service
revenues were essentially 114% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in the percentage of service costs to service revenues is the result of the loss in industrial cleaning service revenues effective
April 1, 2016 without a corresponding reduction in overhead and other operating costs. Some resources previously allocated to servicing
our significant customer were reallocated to the opening of the new rail facility in Illinois which started in April 2016. Product
costs as a percentage of product revenues was 76% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 70% for the quarter ended
September 30, 2015. The primary reasons for the increase in product costs were unexpected costs overruns on one project for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Total non-operating
other income (expense), net was $(136,400) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $35,000 for the quarter ended September
30, 2015. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016 non-operating expenses were comprised of interest expense of $56,000, a litigation
loss accrual of $48,000 and other expenses of $32,400. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015 non-operating income (expense)
of $35,000 was comprised of interest expense of $5,500 offset, other expense of $1,900 offset by gain on debt settlement of $42,400.
The increase in interest expense in Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 is due to an increase in short term financing of $200,000 and convertible
debt financing of $1.25 million which increased interest costs by approximately $39,000 per quarter. This additional interest cost
was not incurred in Q3 2015. 

There is no provision
for income taxes for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 due to prior year losses and for the quarter ended September 30, 2015,
due to our net loss for the period. 

The Company had a
net loss, before non-controlling interest, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of $873,800 compared to a net loss, before
non-controlling interest, of $644,500 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The net loss attributable to SEER after deducting
$83,600 for the non-controlling interest loss was $790,200 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to net loss attributable
to SEER of $536,800, after deducting $107,700 in non-controlling interest loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. As noted
above while revenues declined $131,700 comparing Q3 2016 to Q3 2015, operating expenses also declined $73,800 comparing Q3 2016
to Q3 2015. The reduction in operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as noted above of $50,500
and litigation loss accrual of $48,000. 

Results of Operations for the Nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Total revenues were
approximately $8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $9.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, a decline of $538,600 or 6%. Product revenues, comprising environmental solutions were approximately
$3.45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.80 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The 24% increase in environmental solutions revenue was due to additional long term contracts and from increased sales of bioactive
media. Long term contract revenue increased approximately $57,000 comparing Q3 2016 to Q3 2015. Bioactive media revenues from the
environmental solutions segment increased from $421,900 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $839,000, and increase
of $417,000. Services revenue includes industrial cleaning services and railcar cleaning services. Our railcar cleaning service
revenues increased from approximately $2.26 million for the nine months ended September 30 2015 to $2.43 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $170,500, or 8%. The increase in the number of railcars serviced is a result
of the downturn in the oil and gas market and the railcar industry transition to transporting other liquid products thus increasing
railcar service opportunities. Industrial cleaning services revenues declined approximately $1.35 million, or 32%, from $4.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The primary reason for
the decline in industrial cleaning revenue was the loss of routine maintenance services with our largest customer effective April
1, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 this customer accounted for $2 million in revenues whereas for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 this customer accounted for $3.6 million in industrial cleaning services revenue, a decrease of approximately
$1.6 million. In April 2016 our industrial cleaning services segment commenced opening a railcar facility in Illinois and revenue
generating operations commenced May 2016 generating revenues of $422,200 through September 30, 2016 to partially offset the loss
of industrial service revenues from our customer noted above. Our solid waste segment generated licensing, placement fees and joint
venture billings of $170,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $183,400 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Billings to the PWS-MWS joint ventures are for costs incurred on behalf of the joint venture and in 2016 our solid waste
disposal segment also generated $15,700 in income, representing our portion of the net income generated by the PWS-MWS joint ventures
operations in Paramount, California where one of our CoronaLux  units has been operating under the terms of a temporary permit
issued by SCADMD since May 2015. The solid waste disposal segment receives non-refundable licensing fees which are being recognized
as revenue ratably over the initial term of the agreements of between 5-7 years. 

Operating costs, which
include cost of products, cost of services, solid waste costs, general and administrative (G A) expenses and salaries and related
expenses, were approximately $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating costs of approximately $1.3 is primarily the result of a 1) an increase
in product revenue (environmental solutions) of $658,500 or 24% resulting in a corresponding increase in product costs of $459,300
or 24%, offset by 2) a decrease in industrial and railcar cleaning services costs of $776,500 or 15% with revenue decreasing 18%,
3) a decrease in solid waste costs of $245,000, 4) a decrease in general and administrative costs of $510,700, and 5) a decrease
in salary and related costs of $51,000. Product costs as a percentage of product revenues were 69% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Service costs as a percentage of service revenues were 81% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 78% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Service costs include both industrial
cleaning and railcar cleaning. Industrial cleaning service costs as a percentage of revenue was 90% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 77% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Due to the loss of industrial services revenue from a significant
customer, effective April 1, 2016, overhead costs in industrial services were not reduced relative to the reduction in industrial
services revenue and resources previously allocated to servicing our significant customer were not fully utilized and were partially
reallocated to the opening of a new rail facility in Illinois which started in April 2016. The month of April 2016 generated no
revenue at the new rail facility as it took the entire month to get the site ready for use. Railcar cleaning services costs relative
to revenues decreased from 80% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 70% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
As a result of the increase in railcars available for servicing in 2016, manpower efficiency was improved resulting in improved
margins. Solid waste costs decrease from 2015 to 2016 by approximately $245,000. In 2015 startup and commissioning costs including,
labor, travel, freight, supplies were incurred to get a Coronalux  unit ready for use in Paramount California. Once operations
commenced in May 2015, these costs were not incurred again so they did not repeat in 2016. In addition, the solid waste segment
reduced its headcount to correspond with the level of activity thus also reducing costs in 2016. G A expenses decreased $510,700
from approximately $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to approximately $1.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The primary reasons for the decrease in G A expense are; 1) a reduction in travel expenses of approximately
$61,000, 2) a reduction in marketing of approximately $63,000, 3) a reduction of professional fees of approximately $209,000, 4)
a reduction of direct R D expenses of approximately $108,000 offset by, 5) increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately
$22,000 and 6) increase in liability insurance of approximately $29,000. Salaries and related expenses were $1.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and decrease of approximately
$195,000 is attributable to a reduction in engineering and officer salaries due to reduced headcount. 

Total non-operating
other income (expense), net was $(308,900) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $(1,600) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 non-operating expenses were comprised of interest expense
of $(258,300), loss contingency accrual of $(48,000) and other expense of $(2,600). For the nine months ended September 30, 2015
non-operating expenses of (1,600) was comprised of interest expense of $(45,000) offset by gain on debt settlement of $42,400
and other income of $1,000. The increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to, 1) the issuance of warrants, valued
at approximately $97,000, as an inducement to enter into a short term financing in Q2 2016 whereby the value of the warrants is
considered additional interest costs and 2) in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 we incurred additional convertible debt financing of $1.25 million
which increased interest costs by approximately $25,000 per quarter. This additional interest cost was not incurred during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 as this convertible debt financing was net yet outstanding. In addition, we incurred interest
on short term financing of $30,000 in 2016 that was not incurred in 2015. 

There is no provision
for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to current period and prior year losses and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, due to our net loss for the period. 

The Company had a
net loss, before non-controlling interest, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $(1,679,800) compared to a net loss,
before non-controlling interest, of $(2,117,200) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss attributable to SEER after
deducting $223,100 for the non-controlling interest loss was $(1,456,700) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to net loss attributable to SEER of $(1,736,700), after deducting $380,500 in non-controlling interest loss for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. As noted above, overall revenues declined approximately 6% comparing the nine months ended September
30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 but virtually every category of operating expenses declined, with a total
reduction of approximately $1,268,000 or 11% from 2015 to 2016. As noted above interest expense increased as a result of the increase
in interest bearing debt if Q42015 and Q1 2016. 

Changes in Cash Flow   

Operating Activities  

The Company had net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $(484,300) compared to net cash provided by operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $229,700, a change of $714,000. Cash provided by operating activities
is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments
primarily include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and gain on extinguishment
of debt. Non-cash adjustment totaled $734,900 and $553,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
so non-cash adjustments had a greater impact on net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 than 2015. The net positive change in operating assets and liabilities was $460,600 and $1,793,300 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The primary drivers for net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, despite a net loss of $(1,679,800), was an increase in accounts receivable offset by decreases in prepaid
and other assets of $304,000 and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $204,000. There was an increase in accounts
payable and other accrued liabilities of $509,400, an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncomplete
projects of $112,500, an increase in deferred revenue of $47,800 and an increase in payroll taxes payable. The primary drivers
for net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, despite a net loss of $(2,117,200),
was an decrease in accounts receivable of $1,389,500, an decrease in prepaid and other assets of $150,500, an increase in deferred
revenue of $620,500 which primarily represents payments from PWS licensees for which revenue has not yet been recognized, an increase
in billings in excess of revenue on uncompleted contracts of $93,000, offset by a decrease of accounts payable and accrued liabilities
of $118,500 and increase in costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. The net positive change in operating assets and
liabilities had a much greater impact on net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Investing activities  

The increase in intangibles
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $37,500 in 2016 compared
to additions of $58,900 in 2015. The purchase of property and equipment was $177,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $448,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we received insurance
proceeds of $59,000 from property damage and there were no such proceeds in 2015. 

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided
by financing activities was $525,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $603,200 for nine months ended September
30, 2015. The primary difference is that in 2016, we had proceeds for the sale of stock, short term debt financing, exercise of
warrants and warrant extensions totaling $854,900 and in 2015 there were none of these proceeds. In 2016, we had proceeds of $250,000
from convertible debt whereas in 2015 we had proceeds of $1 million in convertible debt. Debt repayments were approximately $183,000
higher from the repayment of the short term debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to September 30, 2015. 

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments
and Estimates  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.
GAAP) requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount
of intangible assets; valuation allowances and reserves for receivables, inventory and deferred income taxes; revenue recognition
related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method; share-based compensation; and loss contingencies,
including those related to litigation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk  

Accounts receivable
are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable. We determine the allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable, historical experience and management judgment. Accounts receivable
balances are reviewed individually for collectability, and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that
the potential for recovery is remote. An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $250,400 and $246,500 has been reserved
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

We are exposed to
credit risk in the normal course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable. Our customers operate primarily in the
oil production and refining, rail transport, biogas generating and wastewater treatment industries in the United States. Accordingly,
we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the United States. To
limit credit risk, management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance
for doubtful accounts. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we do not believe that we have significant credit risk. 

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments  

The carrying amounts
of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their
fair value due to their short-term maturities. We believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties, including
their current portion, approximate their fair value, as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial
condition and liquidity. We believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value, as their carried interest
rates are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties. 

Long-lived Assets  

We evaluate the carrying
value of long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an
asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the
carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing
of estimated future cash flows. No impairment was determined as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition  

We recognize revenue
related to contract projects and services when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists,
(ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability
is reasonably assured. Our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning, which
we recognize as services are rendered. 

Product revenue generated
from projects, which include the manufacturing of products, for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completed-contract
method for all other projects. Total estimated revenue includes all of the following: (1) the basic contract price (2) contract
options and (3) change orders.  Once contract performance is underway,
we may experience changes in conditions, client requirements, specifications, designs, materials and expectations regarding the
period of performance. Such changes are  change orders  and may be initiated by us or by our clients. In many cases,
agreement with the client as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing; however, sometimes circumstances
require that work progress without obtaining client agreement. Revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred
if it is probable that costs will be recovered by changing the contract price. The Company does not incur pre-contract costs. 
Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total
estimated contract costs. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses
are identified and included as additional loss. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities
on the balance sheet, if significant, except in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, in which
case the provisions are deducted from the accumulated costs. A provision as a liability is reported as a current liability. 

For contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method, we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction
contracts realizable and payable. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess
of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to date, and are recognized as a current asset. Billings in excess
of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract
costs and profits recognized to date, and are recognized as a current liability. 

The Company s
revenues from waste destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license. 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, for revenues which contain multiple deliverables, the
Company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria: (i) the delivered items
have a stand-alone value to the customer; (ii) the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined; and (iii) if
the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled
by the seller.  Deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting
unit.  Revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature, primarily ASC 605. 

Stock-based
Compensation  

We account for stock-based
awards at fair value on the date of grant, and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest. We
estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated
value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures,
is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,
and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative
adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. 

Recently issued accounting
pronouncements   

Changes to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASU s) to the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification. The
Company considers the applicability and impact of all new or revised ASU s. 

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). 

As of the end of the
period covered by this report, and under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and the person performing the similar function as Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive
Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There have been no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15 (f) under the Exchange
Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time,
the Company may become a party to legal actions or proceedings in the ordinary course of its business.  As of September 30,
2016, there were no other such actions or proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that, if decided adversely to the
Company s interests, the Company believes would be material to its business. 

In March 2016, a complaint
was filed by a lessor of property leased by REGS, a subsidiary of the Company. The month-to-month lease expired February 29, 2016,
when REGS vacated the property. The landlord has made certain claims including property damage, and loss of rents, attorney fees
and other costs totaling approximately $97,000. REGS has engaged defense counsel and intends to zealously oppose the claims. While
the Company s management believes the claims are without merit, the Company has accrued $48,400 as a loss against this claim. 

In January 2016, an employee of SEM was involved in a vehicle accident while on Company business. The accident
resulted in one fatality and injuries to another party. The two parties filed lawsuits against SEM as a result of the accident
and the claims were turned over to our insurance carrier. Defense counsel was provided for and appointed by the Company s
insurance carrier. In August 2016, both claimants each filed a claim with our insurance carrier for the full amount of our insurance
coverage, approximately $6 million. Later in August 2016, an involuntary proceeding was commenced by one of the claimants against
SEM under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy code by one claimant as a result of both claimants filing for the $6 million in insurance
available under our policies. SEM engaged bankruptcy counsel who filed certain motions on behalf of SEM. In September, the case
was converted to a Chapter 11 under the Bankruptcy code and the Bankruptcy court granted SEM s motion and ordered that the
$6 million in insurance proceeds under our policy would be an asset of the estate of SEM. In October 2016, the Company filed a
plan of reorganization with the court that allows for an equitable split of the $6 million in insurance proceeds, as determined
by the two claimants, and allows for all creditors of SEM, both secured and unsecured, to be paid in full if the two claimants
can come to terms with an equitable allocation of the $6 million in insurance proceeds. At this time SEM continues to manage its
affairs and is currently operating normally. The ultimate outcome of this Chapter 11 proceeding is uncertain at this time. Management
does not currently believe that any assets of SEM are impaired as of September 30, 2016. Operations and production are continuing
uninterrupted. 

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  

Please review our report on Form 10K Part
1, Item 1A for a complete statement of  Risk Factors  that pertain to our business. 

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds.  

During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 60,000 common stock options to employees exercisable at $.60 per
share. 

In the third quarter
of 2016, the Company issued $250,000 in convertible debt that is convertible into 357,142 shares of its $.001 par value common
stock. 

In May 2016, the Company
issued 500,000 warrants, in connection with a short term financing, exercisable at $.50 per share for a period of four years. 

On September 30, 2016,
the Company issued 50,000 warrants, in connection with a convertible debt issuance, exercisable for five years at $.85 per share
and were valued at $4,900 using the Black Scholes valuation method. 

The issuance of the
shares of our common stock described above was pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended and related state private offering exemptions. All of the investors were Accredited Investors as defined
in the Securities Act who took their shares for investments purposes without a view to distribution and had access to information
concerning the company and its business prospects, as required by the Securities Act. 

In addition, there
was no general solicitation or advertising for the purchase of these shares. All certificates for these shares issued pursuant
to Section 4(2) contain a restrictive legend. Finally, our stock transfer agent has been instructed not to transfer any of such
shares unless such shares are registered for resale or there is an exemption with respect to their transfer.
