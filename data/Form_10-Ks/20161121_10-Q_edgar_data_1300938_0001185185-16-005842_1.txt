NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016

(UNAUDITED )

Note 1      Overview and Description of the Company

ABCO Energy, Inc. was organized on July 29, 2004 and operated until July 1, 2011 as Energy Conservation Technologies, Inc. (ENYC).  On July 1, 2011 ENYC entered into a share exchange agreement (SEA) with ABCO Energy and acquired all of the assets of ABCO.  ENYC changed its name to ABCO Energy, Inc. on October 31, 2011.  The Company is in the Photo Voltaic (PV) solar systems industry, sells energy efficient lighting (LED) and is an electrical product and services supplier.  

The Company prepared these financial statements according to the instructions for Form 10-Q. Therefore, the financial statements do not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, the Company has recorded all transactions and adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. The adjustments made are normal and recurring. The following notes describe only the material changes in accounting policies, account details or financial statement notes during the first Nine Months of 2016. Therefore, please read these financial statements and notes to the financial statements together with the audited financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income statement for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 cannot necessarily be used to project results for the full year.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant estimates include, but are not limited to the estimated useful lives of equipment for purposes of depreciation and the valuation of common shares issued for services, equipment and the liquidation of liabilities.

Income (Loss) per Share

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average numbers of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods, including dilutive effects of stock options, warrants granted and convertible preferred stock. Dilutive options and warrants that are issued during a period or that expire or are canceled during a period are reflected in the computations for the time they were outstanding during the periods being reported. Since ABCO Energy has incurred losses for all periods except the current period, the impact of the common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation.  In addition, there are no common stock equivalents outstanding at the time of this report.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 amends previous guidance to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company plans to adopt ASU No.2015-03 regarding the presentation of debt issuance cost from fiscal year 2016.

Note 2      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale date of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.

The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:

Level 1:  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2:  Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.    

The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the current nature of these instruments. Debt approximates fair value based on interest rates available for similar financial arrangements. Derivative liabilities which have been bifurcated from host convertible debt agreements are presented at fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as convertible features in convertible debts or equity instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the binomial option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if these is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments.  

Once determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments, such as warrants, are also valued using the binomial option-pricing model.

Note 3      Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged substantially in financing activities and developing its business plan and marketing. As a result, the Company incurred accumulated net losses from inception through the period ended September 30, 2016 of $(3,125,817).  In addition, the Company s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through capital contributions from shareholders.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock or through debt financing and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Earnings (loss) per share calculation

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period

The computation of basic and diluted loss per share at September 30, 2016 excludes the common stock equivalents from convertible debt of the following potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:

Note 11     Subsequent Events

During the period from October 1, 2016 through November 16, 2016, the Company issued 12,316,070 shares of common stock and received or credited gross proceeds of $224,640.

Item 2.     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   OVERVIEW

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.

Our discussion of operating results for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses.

Sales consist of photovoltaic products, electrical services and LED lighting products and installation during both periods for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the Nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $512,075 as compared to $1,231,100 for the same nine months in 2015.  This is a decrease of $719,025 or 58% below the 2015 sales. The Solar sales revenue in 2016 and 2015 reflected seasonal and changing market conditions in the financing of solar installations and competition from the public utilities in the Arizona markets.  When the utilities in Arizona cancelled or substantially reduced the rebate programs, the financing or leasing companies that were able to reduce the financial requirements by accepting the rebates as partial payments were no longer able to make loans or leases that required no money down or longer terms for their finance products.  The public utilities also entered the home solar market with deeply discounted financing and have become our largest competitor. This severally reduced the opportunities for sales and reduced gross margins substantially.  Without available financing, the sales of solar products became even more difficult.  The prices of solar products were reduced in 2016 and 2015 to offset the reduction or elimination of rebates and the market has recovered from this time.  ABCO has worked diligently to overcome these changes by focusing on commercial applications and the increased interest of business and government in the LED lighting contracts.

Cost of sales was 121% of revenues in 2016 and 45% of revenues in 2015.   Gross margins were (21) % of revenue in 2016 and 65% of revenue for the Nine months of 2015.  During 2016 and 2015 we have been offering new products and have found our entry market prices for steel parking structures have added gross margins higher than usual because we use outside contractors for the entire projects.  Our gross profit reflects this decision and cost overruns have created these negative results.  We feel that we have made progress in entering the parking shade markets and that our gross margins will stabilize as growth lowers these margins in the future.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses were 110% of revenues in 2016 and 42% of revenues for the same period in 2015.  Net loss from operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $(669,682) not including interest expense on all debt of $(93,252) as compared to the net income of $159,165 from operations for the same nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  Our other expenses for this period were higher by $394,73005 than the comparative period in 2015 due to the accrual of $227,726 of derivative interest liability for convertible debt and amortization of discount on convertible debt equal to $118,514. The interest expense during the period ended September 30, 2016 has expanded by $48,690 greater than in the period ended September 30, 2015 due mostly to the working capital provision of merchant loans and convertible debt.  This combination of factors increased the operating loss for the period ending September 30, 2016. Since our year to date revenues are lower than the previous year, this resulted in higher operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue.

As noted in previous paragraphs discussing market conditions, ABCO could not finish its backlog of work and expand into the markets of LED lights and commercial solar markets without maintaining staff, facilities and sales expenses.  When sales revenues fall, and expenses are not reduced in equal amounts or percentages, the result is an increase of the percentage of operating expenses to sales revenue.  Operating expenses for the two periods increased to accommodate our expansion of sales programs, but not in the same ratio as the reduction in sales. ABCO chose to maintain a level of expenses that would not cripple the Company s future.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS - DESCRIPTION OF STATEMENT

In financial accounting, the  cash flow statement  also known as a  statement of cash flows  is a financial statement that shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing and financing activities. Essentially, the cash flow statement is concerned with the flow of cash in and out of the business. The statement captures both the current operating results and the accompanying changes in the balance sheet.  As an analytical tool, the statement of cash flows is useful in determining the short-term viability of a company, particularly its ability to pay bills.

The cash flow statement reflects a firm s liquidity.

The balance sheet is a snapshot of a firm s financial resources and obligations at a single point in time.

The income statement summarizes a firm s financial transactions over an interval of time.

These last two financial statements reflect the accrual basis accounting used by firms to match revenues with the expenses associated with generating those revenues.

The cash flow statement includes only inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents; it excludes transactions that do not directly affect cash receipts and payments. These non-cash transactions include depreciation or write-offs on bad debts or credit losses to name a few. The cash flow statement is a cash basis report on Nine types of financial activities: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Non-cash activities are usually reported in footnotes.

The cash flow statement is intended to:

1.   
 
 Provide information on a firm s liquidity and solvency and its ability to change cash flows in future circumstances

2.   
 
 Provide additional information for evaluating changes in assets, liabilities and equity

3.   
 
 Improve the comparability of different firms  operating performance by eliminating the effects of different accounting methods

4.   
 
 Indicate the amount, timing and probability of future cash flows 

The cash flow statement has been adopted as a standard financial statement because it eliminates allocations, which might be derived from different accounting methods, such as various timeframes for depreciating fixed assets.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015

During the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 our net cash used by operating activities was $(360,137) and comparatively the net cash used by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $(127,252).  Net cash used by operating activities in the period ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of net loss from operations of $(1,108,974) for 2016 as compared to an income of $114,603 for 2015.  Derivative accrual accounted for $375,875 of this expense for the nine month period. Depreciation adjustments were of non-cash expenses were $9,886 and $8,573 for each year respectively.  The Company experienced an increase in accounts payable of $17,922 and a decrease of $135,352 for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. In addition, cash received from billings in excess of costs on projects totaled $225,987. We also incurred substantial expenses and cost overruns for the commercial projects sold during the period ended September 30, 2016 as reflected in the nine months financial statements cost of sales.  Accounts receivable on contacts in process decreased by $115,230 during the period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 due to collections from commercial projects at the end of the period.

Net cash provided or (used) for investing activities for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,330 and $480 respectively due to receipt of principal on leases and equipment acquisitions.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $334,256 and $179,783 respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from the sale of common stock, loans from a financial institution and loans from a Director.  Proceeds from convertible notes accounted for $109,125 change to cash flow from financing activities. The total convertible debt received in the current nine month period  was $234,777,, as well as  $48,976 of institutional debt and $70,138 from officers and other related parties during the same period.   Any future conversions will increase the number of shares outstanding and the Stockholders Equity by the amount of the original investment.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.

Our discussion of operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses.

Sales consist of photovoltaic products, electrical services and LED lighting products and installation during both periods for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $146,547 as compared to $610,317 for the same three months in 2015.  This is a decrease of $(463,770) or 76% below the 2015 sales. The Solar sales revenue in 2016 and 2015 reflected seasonal and changing market conditions in the financing of solar installations and competition from the public utilities in the Arizona markets.  When the utilities in Arizona cancelled or substantially reduced the rebate programs, the financing or leasing companies that were able to reduce the financial requirements by accepting the rebates as partial payments were no longer able to make loans or leases that required no money down or longer terms for their finance products.  This severally reduced the opportunities for sales and reduced gross margins substantially. The public utilities also entered the home solar market with deeply discounted financing and became the company s largest competitor.  Without available financing, the sales of solar products became even more difficult.  The prices of solar products were reduced in 2016 and 2015 to offset the reduction or elimination of rebates and the market has recovered from this time, although gross margins have suffered dramatically.  ABCO has worked diligently to overcome these changes by focusing on commercial applications and the increased interest of business and government in the LED lighting contracts.

Cost of sales was 70% of revenues in 2016 and 19% of revenues in 2015.   Gross margins were 19% of revenue in 2016 and 81% of revenue for the three months of 2015.  During 2016 and 2015 we have been offering new products and have found our entry market prices for steel parking structures have added gross margins higher than usual because we use outside contractors for the entire projects.  Our gross profit reflects this decision.  We feel that we have made progress in entering the parking shade markets and that our gross margins will stabilize as growth lowers these margins in the future.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses were 129% of revenues in 2016 and 31% of revenues for the same period in 2015.  Net loss from operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $(161,375) as compared to the net income of $299,860 for the same three month period ended September 30, 2015.  Our operating expenses for this period were lower by $1,814 than the comparative period in 2015. The interest expense during the period ended September 30, 2016 has expanded by $23,538 greater than in the period ended September 30, 2015 due mostly to the working capital provision of merchant loans and convertible debt.  Since our year to date revenues are lower than the previous year, this resulted in higher operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue.  Net income was $13,401 and $285,005 the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectfully, however, the 2016 period was affected by a reversal of $278,910 in derivative liability interest accrual expense.

As noted in previous paragraphs discussing market conditions, ABCO could not finish its backlog of work and expand into the markets of LED lights and commercial solar markets without maintaining staff, facilities and sales expenses.  When sales revenues fall, and expenses are not reduced in equal amounts or percentages, the result is an increase of the percentage of operating expenses to sales revenue.  Operating expenses for the two periods increased to accommodate our expansion of sales programs, but not in the same ratio as the reduction in sales. ABCO chose to maintain a level of expenses that would not cripple the Company s future.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for carrying cost of accounts receivable after completion of contracts.  The industry habitually requires the solar contractor to wait for the utility approval to be paid for the contracts. This process can easily exceed 90 days and sometimes requires the contractor to pay all or most of the cost of the project without assistance from suppliers. Our working capital at September 30, 2016 was $(1,156,033) and it was $(213,664) at December 31, 2015.  This decrease of $(942,369) was primarily due to losses from operations during the period ended September 30, 2016 and adjustments for possible future losses on derivative conversions of $485,000.  Bank financing has not been available to the Company but we have been able to increase our credit lines with our suppliers because of good credit.  There are no material covenants on our credit lines, normally due in 30 days, since they are standard in the industry and the balances vary on a daily basis. Most are personally guaranteed by the Officer of the Company.

We have been able to borrow an additional $70,138 from one of our Directors and other related parties to increase working capital during the period ended September 30, 2016 bringing the total borrowed from Directors, officers and others related parties to $140,082. There are no existing agreements or arrangement with any Director to provide additional funds to the Company.  These loans from Directors, Officers and other related parties are owed $25,928 in accrued interest at September 30, 2016.

PLAN OF OPERATIONS

Based on our current financial position, we cannot anticipate whether we will not have sufficient working capital to sustain operations for the next year if we do not raise additional capital.  We will not however, be able to reach our goals and projections for multistate expansion without a cash infusion.   We have been able to raise sufficient capital to sustain operations through the sale of our common shares and we have incurred substantial increases in debt from our trade creditors in the normal course of business.   Management will not expand the business until adequate working capital is provided.  Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on our ability to attain profitable operations or to raise additional capital. We have no anticipated timeline for obtaining neither additional financing nor the expansion of our business.  We will continue to keep our expenses as low as possible and keep our operations in line with available working capital as long as possible.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain adequate capital from any sources, or at all.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Not Applicable to Smaller Reporting Companies.

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the reporting period of September 30, 2015, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer/Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), which disclosure controls and procedures are designed to insure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman/CEO and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are currently effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s period SEC filings.

(b) Changes in Internal Control.

Subsequent to the date of such evaluation as described in subparagraph (a) above, there were no changes necessary in our internal controls or other factors that could significantly affect these controls, including any corrective action with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

(c) Limitations.

Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. However, we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving this objective. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results.
