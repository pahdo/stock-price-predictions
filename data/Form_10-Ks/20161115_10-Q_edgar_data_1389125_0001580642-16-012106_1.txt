Organization and Purpose    

Equinox
Frontier Funds, which is referred to in this report as the  Trust , was formed on August 8, 2003, as a Delaware
statutory trust. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements of the Trust included within this periodic report. The
Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) Regulation
  4.10(d)(2). The Trust has authority to issue separate series, or each, a Series, of units of beneficial interest ( Units )
pursuant to the requirements of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, as amended ( Trust Act ). The assets of each
Series are valued and accounted for separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is not registered as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended-. It is managed by its managing
owner, Equinox Fund Management, LLC ( Managing Owner ).  

Purchasers
of Units are limited owners of the Trust ( Limited Owners ) with respect to beneficial interests of the Series 
Units purchased. The Trust Act provides that, except as otherwise provided in the second amended and restated declaration of trust
and trust agreement dated December 9, 2013, by and among the Managing Owner, Wilmington Trust Company as trustee and the
unitholders, as may be amended from time to time ( Trust Agreement ), unitholders of the Trust
will have the same limitation of liability as do stockholders of private corporations organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware. The Trust Agreement confers substantially the same limited liability, and contains the same limited
exceptions thereto, as would a limited partnership agreement for a Delaware limited partnership engaged in like transactions as
the Trust. In addition, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Managing Owner of the Trust is liable for obligations of a Series
in excess of that Series  assets. Limited owners do not have any such liability. The Managing Owner will make contributions
to the Series of the Trust necessary to maintain at least a 1% interest in the aggregate capital, profits and losses of the combined
Series of the Trust.  

The
Trust, in relation to the Series, has been organized to pool assets of investor funds for the purpose of trading in the United
States ( U.S. ) and international markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products,
precious and base metals and other commodities. The Trust, in relation to the Series, may also engage in futures contracts, forwards,
option contracts and other interest in derivative instruments, including swap contracts.  

The
Trust has seven (7) separate and distinct Series of Units issued and outstanding: Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox
Frontier Masters Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund,
Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, (each a  Series  and collectively, the  Series ).
The Trust, with respect to the Series, may issue additional Series of Units.  

26  

           Table of Contents            

The
Trust, with respect to each Series:  

engages
in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including interbank foreign currencies), options contracts
and other derivative instruments (including swap contracts), and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions;  

allocates
funds to a limited liability trading company or companies ( Trading Company  or  Trading Companies ) and
Galaxy Plus entities ( Galaxy Plus ). Except as otherwise described in these notes, each Trading Company and Galaxy
Plus entity has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent commodity trading advisor(s), or each, a Trading Advisor,
that will manage all or a portion of such Trading Company s and Galaxy Plus assets and make the trading decisions for the
assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. Each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will
segregate its assets from any other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity;  

maintains
separate, distinct records for each Series, and accounts for the assets of each Series separately from the other Series;  

calculates
the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) of its Units for each Series separately from the other Series;  

has
an investment objective of increasing the value of each Series  Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while managing
risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments;  

maintains
                                         each Series of Units in three to seven sub-classes Class 1, Class 1a, Class 1AP,
                                         Class 2, Class 2a, Class 3, and Class 3a. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or
                                         Class 1a Units of Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, and
                                         Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund are charged a service fee of up to two percent
                                         (2.0%) annually of the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service
                                         fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class 1 or
                                         Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate
                                         of up to two percent (2.0%) of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such
                                         Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
                                         by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors
                                         who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during
                                         the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are
                                         subject to a redemption fee of up to two percent (2.0%) of the purchase price at
                                         which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
                                         balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class
                                         1a Units of Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox Frontier
                                         Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier Winton Fund are charged a service fee of up to three
                                         percent (3.0%) annually of the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial
                                         service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class
                                         1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual
                                         rate of up to three percent (3.0) of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a
                                         of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling
                                         agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors
                                         who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during
                                         the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are
                                         subject to a redemption fee of up to three percent (3.0%) of the purchase price
                                         at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
                                         balance of the prepaid initial service fee. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units
                                         of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an ongoing service fee to selling agents of up
                                         to one half percent (0.5%) annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which
                                         0.25% will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Equinox Frontier
                                         Diversified Fund, and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of the Equinox
                                         Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are
                                         subject to the fee limitation are reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable
                                         Series. Class 1AP was created as a sub-class of Class 1 and it has been presented separately
                                         because the fees applicable to it are different from those applicable to Class 1. Currently
                                         the service fee is not charged to Class 1AP investors. The Managing Owner may also pay
                                         selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other services
                                         rendered and expenses incurred by such selling agents; and  

all
payments made to selling agents who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ( FINRA ) and
their associated persons that constitute underwriting compensation will be subject to the limitations set forth in Rule 2310(b)(4)(B)(ii)
(formerly Rule 2810(b)(4)(B)(ii)) of the Conduct Rules of FINRA ( Rule 2310 ). An investor s Class 1 Units or
Class 2 Units of any Series, or Class 1a Units or Class 2a Units of the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund or Equinox
Frontier Balanced Fund will be classified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of such Series, as applicable, when the Managing Owner
determines that the fee limitation with respect to such Units has been reached or will be reached.
The service fee limit applicable to each unit sold is reached upon the earlier of when (i) the aggregate initial and ongoing
service fees received by the selling agent with respect to such unit equals 9% of the purchase price of such unit or (ii) the
aggregate underwriting compensation (determined in accordance with FINRA Rule 2310) paid in respect of such unit
totals 10% of the purchase price of such unit.
No service
fees are paid with respect to Class 3 or Class 3a Units. Units of any Class in a Series may be redeemed, in whole or in part,
on a daily basis, at the then current NAV per Unit for such Series on the day of the week after the date the Managing Owner is
in receipt of a redemption request for at least one (1) Business Day to be received by the Managing Owner prior to 4:00 PM
in New York.  

The
assets of any particular Series include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the Trust,
with respect to the Series, on account of and for the benefit of that Series. Under the  Inter-Series Limitation on Liability 
expressly provided for under Section 3804(a) of the Trust Act, separate and distinct records of the cash and equivalents,
although pooled for maximizing returns, are maintained in the books and records of each Series.

Use
of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP may require the Managing Owner to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The valuation
of swap contracts requires significant estimates as well as the valuation of certain other investments. Please refer to Note 3
for discussion of valuation methodology. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash and overnight investments in interest-bearing demand deposits
held at banks with original maturities of three months or less. This cash is not restricted.  

Interest
Income  U.S. Treasury Securities are pooled for purposes of maximizing
returns on these assets to investors of all Series. Interest income from pooled cash management assets is recognized on the accrual
basis and allocated daily to each Series based upon its daily proportion of ownership of the pool. Aggregate interest income from
all sources, including U.S. Treasuries and assets held at a futures commission merchant ( FCM ), of up to two percentage
points of the aggregate percentage yield (annualized) of net asset value less any fair market value related to swaps, is paid to
the Managing Owner by the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1, and Class 2 only), Equinox Frontier Select Fund, Equinox Frontier
Winton Fund and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity
Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund and Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a only), 20% of the total
interest allocated to each Series was paid to the Managing Owner from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016; thereafter 100% of
the interest is retained by the respective Series. All interest not paid to the Managing Owner is interest income to the Series,
and shown net on the statement of operations.     

U.S.
Treasury Securities  U.S. Treasury Securities are allocated to all Series of the Trust based on each Series  percentage
ownership in the pooled cash management assets as of the reporting date. They are reported at fair value as Level 1 inputs under
ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (  ASC 820 ). The Series of the Trust valued U.S. Treasury
Securities at fair value and recorded the daily change in value in the statements of operations as net unrealized gain/(loss)
on U.S. Treasury securities. Accrued interest is reported on the statements of financial condition as interest receivable.

           Table of Contents            

Receivable
From Futures Commission Merchants  The Series of the Trust deposit assets with a FCM subject to CFTC regulations and
various exchange and broker requirements. Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of cash with such FCM. The Trust, with
respect to the Series, earns interest income on its assets deposited with the FCM.  

Investment
Transactions  Futures, options on futures, forward and swap contracts are recorded on a trade date basis and realized
gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between
contract trade price and market price) are reported in the statements of financial condition as open trade equity (deficit) for
futures and forwards and as long and short options as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in accordance
with ASC 210,  Balance Sheet ( ASC 210  ) and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-01,  Balance Sheet (Topic
210 ).  

Any
change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the statements of operations. Fair value of exchange-traded
contracts is based upon exchange settlement prices. Fair value of non-exchange-traded contracts is based on third party quoted
dealer values on the interbank market. For U.S. Treasury securities, interest is recognized in the period earned and the instruments
are marked-to-market daily based on third party information. Transaction costs are recognized as incurred and reflected separately
in the statements of operations.  

Foreign
Currency Transactions  The Series  functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however, they transact business in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. The Series do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign
exchange rates on investments from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are
included with the net realized or unrealized gain or loss from investments.  

Allocation
of Earnings  Each Series of the Trust may maintain between three or seven subclasses of Units Class 1, Class 2,
Class 3, Class 1a, Class 2a, Class 3a and Class 1AP. All classes have identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights
and the same terms and conditions, except that fees charged to a Class or Series differ as described below. Revenues, expenses
(other than expenses attributable to a specific class), and realized and unrealized trading gains and losses of each Series are
allocated daily to Class 1, Class 1a, Class 2, Class 2a, Class 3, Class 3a and Class 1AP Units based on each Class  respective
owners  capital balances as applicable to the classes maintained by the Series.  

Each
Series allocates funds to an affiliated Trading Company, or Companies, of the Trust, or Galaxy Plus. Each Trading Company allocates
all of its daily trading gains or losses to the Series in proportion to each Series  ownership trading level interest in
the Trading Company, adjusted on a daily basis (except for Trading Advisors and other investments such as Swaps that are directly
allocated to a specific series). Likewise, trading gains and losses earned and incurred by the Series through their investments
in Galaxy Plus entities are allocated to those series on a daily basis. The allocation of gains and losses in Galaxy Plus entities
are based on each series pro-rata shares of the trading level of that entity which is updated at the beginning of each month or
more frequently if there is a subscription or redemption activity in the entity. The value of all open contracts and cash held
at clearing brokers is similarly allocated to the Series in proportion to each Series  funds allocated to the Trading Companies
or Galaxy Plus entities.  

Investments
and Swaps  The Trust, with respect to the Series, records investment transactions on a trade date basis and at fair
value, with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on investments in the statements
of operations. Certain Series of the Trust strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected
at the discretion of the Managing Owner. Swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns linked
to those produced by one or more underlying investment products or indices. In a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the
returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined investments or instruments.
The gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are calculated with respect to a  notional
amount  (i.e., the amount of value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate, return, or other
amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of securities. The valuation of swap contracts
requires significant estimates. Swap contracts are reported at fair value based upon daily reports from the counterparty. The Managing
Owner reviews and approves current day pricing of the commodity trading advisor ( CTA ) positions, as received from
the counterparty which includes intra-day volatility and volume and daily index performance, that is used to determine a daily
fair value NAV for the swap contracts.

Income
Taxes  The Trust, with respect to the Series, applies the provisions of ASC 740  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ),
which provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
statements. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods and disclosure. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Trust, with respect to the Series , financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not 
of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the Trust s level not deemed to
meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The Managing
Owner has concluded there is no tax expense, interest or penalties to be recorded by the Trust, with respect to the Series. The
2012 through 2016 tax years generally remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.  

In the opinion of the Managing Owner, (i) the Trust, with respect to the Series, is treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes and, assuming that at least 90% of the gross income of the Trust constitutes  qualifying
income  within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code, (ii) the Trust is not a publicly traded partnership treated
as a corporation, and (iii) the discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading  U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
correctly summarizes the material federal income tax consequences as of the date of the Prospectus to potential U.S. Limited Owners
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units of the Trust.  

Fees
and Expenses  All management fees, incentive fees, service fees and trading fees of the Trust, with respect to the Series,
are paid to the Managing Owner. It is the responsibility of the Managing Owner to pay all Trading Advisor management and incentive
fees, selling agent service fees and all other operating expenses and continuing offering costs of the Trust, with respect to
the Series.  

Service Fees    The
Trust may maintain each Series of Units in three to seven sub-classes Class 1, Class 1AP, Class 1a, Class 2, Class 2a, Class
3, and Class 3a. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund, and Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund are charged a service fee of up to two percent (2.0%) annually of
the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling
such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to two percent (2.0%)
of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the
selling agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion
of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase
are subject to a redemption fee of up to two percent (2.0%) of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse
the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or
Class 1a Units of Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier
Winton Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent (3.0%) annually of the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the
initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial
service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent (3.0%) of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or
Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents by the Managing Owner
in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units
of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption fee
of up to three percent (3.0%) of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
balance of the prepaid initial service fee. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an
ongoing service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent (0.5%) annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of
which 0.25% will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund and Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which
are subject to the fee limitation are reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series for administrative purposes.
Currently the service fee is not charged to Class 1AP investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional
fees and expenses for administrative and other services rendered and expenses incurred by such selling agents.  

These
service fees are part of the offering costs of the Trust, with respect to the Series, which include registration and filing fees,
legal and blue sky expenses, accounting and audit, printing, marketing support and other offering costs which are borne by the
Managing Owner. With respect to the service fees, the initial service fee (for the first 12 months) relating to a purchase of
Class 1 and Class 1a Units by an investor is prepaid by the Managing Owner to the relevant selling agent in the month following
such purchase and is reimbursed for such payment by the Series monthly in arrears in an amount based upon a corresponding percentage
of NAV, calculated daily. Consequently, the Managing Owner bears the risk of the downside and the benefit of the upside potential
of any difference between the amount of the initial service fee prepaid by it and the amount of the reimbursement thereof, which
may result from variations in NAV over the following 12 months.  

Pending
Owner Additions  Funds received for new subscriptions and for additions to existing owner interests are recorded as capital
additions at the NAV per unit of the second business day following receipt.  

Reclassification
   Certain amounts in the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation. None
of the reclasses had an impact on the NAV or performance of the Series.  

Subsequent Events  The Series, follow the provisions of ASC 855, Subsequent Events, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
of events that occur after the balance sheet date and up through the date the financial statements are issued.

Fair Value Measurements    

In
connection with the valuation of investments the Series apply ASC 820. ASC 820 provides clarification that when a quoted price
in an active market for the identical asset or liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value
using certain techniques. ASC 820 also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, a reporting entity
is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents
the transfer of an asset or liability. ASC 820 also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset
or liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical asset or liability when traded as an asset in an active
market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements.  

Level
1 Inputs     

Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement
date.  

Level
2 Inputs     

Inputs
other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar financial assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar financial
assets in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the financial assets or inputs
that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.  

Level
3 Inputs     

Unobservable
inputs for determining the fair value of financial assets that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the financial asset.  

The
Trust, with respect to the Series, uses the following methodologies to value instruments within its financial asset portfolio
at fair value:  

Trading
Securities.  These instruments include U.S. Treasury securities and open trade equity positions (futures contracts) that are
actively traded on public markets with quoted pricing for corroboration. U.S. Treasury securities and futures contracts, are reported
at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Trading securities instruments further include open trade equity positions (trading options
and currency forwards) that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets that are not traded on active markets. Trading options
and currency forwards are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs.  

Swap
Contracts . Certain Series of the Trust strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected
at the direction of the Managing Owner. Swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns linked
to those produced by one or more investment products or indices. In a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the returns
(or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined investments or instruments. The
gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are calculated with respect to a  notional amount 
(i.e., the amount of value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate, return, or other amount to
be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of securities. Swap contracts are reported at fair value
basis upon daily reports from the counterparty. The Managing Owner reviews and approves current day pricing of the CTA positions,
as received from the counterparty which includes intra-day volatility and volume and daily index performance, that is used
to determine a daily fair value NAV for the swap contracts.   

The
Managing Owner has chartered a valuation committee to provide oversight of the valuation process for the Series. The valuation
committee meets at least monthly to discuss the valuation process and any valuation issues that may arise. The valuation committee
is comprised of senior members of the Managing Owner s management team with varying areas of expertise that add value to
the committee. The valuation committee reports to both the Managing Owner s Investment Oversight and Risk Committee and
the Trust s Executive Committee. The valuation committee further remains in communication with the Managing Owner s
Due Diligence Committee that provides ongoing counterparty risk monitoring of the swap counterparties. The Managing Owner s
valuation committee monitors some additional input factors such as liquidity, volatility, and counterparty risk in order to further
review the valuations provided by the pricing service.

Investment
in Unconsolidated Trading Companies.  This investment represents the fair value of the allocation of cash, futures, forwards,
options and swaps to each respective Series relative to its trading allocations from unconsolidated Trading Companies. A Series
may redeem its investment in any of the Trading Companies on a daily basis at the Trading Company s stated net asset value.
Each of the Series, all of which are under the same management as the Trading Companies, has access to the underlying positions
of the Trading Companies, and as such, the level determination is reflected on that look-through basis. Any redemption of an investment
in a Trading Company classified as Level 3 will reflect that classification of the underlying investment owned by the Trading
Company. As such, the Series report investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies at fair value using the corresponding inputs
of the underlying securities of the Trading Companies which results in the Series reporting the corresponding level determination
from the inputs of the Trading Company.  

Investments
in Private Investment Companies . Investments in private investment companies are valued utilizing the net asset values provided
by the underlying private investment companies as a practical expedient. The Fund applies the practical expedient to its investments
in private investment companies on an investment-by-investment basis, and consistently with the Fund s entire position in
a particular investment, unless it is probable that the Fund will sell a portion of an investment at an amount different from
the net asset value of the investment.  Management has adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU 2015-07,  Disclosures
for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)    a consensus
of the Emerging Issues Task Force issued, on May 1, 2015. The guidance in this standard was effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. In accordance with Subtopic 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using
the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy below.  

The
following table summarizes the instruments that comprise the Trust, with respect to the Series, financial asset portfolio, by
Series, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 segregated by the level
of valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value. Investments in private investment companies
are valued utilizing the net asset values provided by the underlying private investment companies as a practical expedient. Each
Series applies the practical expedient to its investments in private investment companies on an investment-by-investment basis,
and consistently with the Series entire position in a particular investment, unless it is probable that the Series will sell a
portion of an investment at an amount different from the net asset value of the investment.

on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Series  accounting
policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Trust did not transfer any assets between Levels 1, 2 or 3.  

The

Swap Contracts   

In
addition to authorizing Trading Advisors to manage pre-determined investment levels of futures, options on futures and forward
contracts, certain Series of the Trust will strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected
at the direction of the Managing Owner. Total return swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns
linked to those produced by one or more investment products or indices. In a typical total return swap, two parties agree to exchange
the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined investments or instruments.
The gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are calculated with respect to a  notional
amount  (i.e., the amount or value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate, return, or other
amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of securities.  

Each
Series  investment in swaps will likely differ substantially over time due to cash flows, portfolio management decisions
and market movements. The swaps serve to diversify the investment holdings of each Series and to provide access to programs and
advisors that would not be otherwise available to the Series, and are not used for hedging purposes.  

The
Managing Owner follows a procedure in selecting well-established financial institutions which the Managing Owner, in its sole
discretion, considers to be reputable, reliable, financially responsible and well established to act as swap counterparties. The
procedure includes due diligence review of documentation on all new and existing financial institution counterparties prior to
initiation of the relationship, and quarterly ongoing review during the relationship, to ensure that counterparties meet the Managing
Owner s minimum credit requirements, the counterparty average rating being no less than an investment grade rating as defined
by the rating agencies. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 9.2% and 9.3%, respectively, of the Trust s
assets were deposited with over-the-counter counterparties in order to initiate and maintain swaps and is recorded as collateral
within the swap fair value within the statement of financial condition. The cash held with the counterparty is not restricted.  

The
Series may strategically invest assets in one or more swaps linked to certain underlying investments or indices at the direction
of the Managing Owner. The Trading Company in which the assets of these Series will be invested will not own any of the investments
or indices referenced by any swap entered into by these Series. In addition, neither the swap counterparty to the Trading Company
of these Series nor any advisor referenced by any such swap is a Trading Advisor to these Series.  

The
Series have invested in the following Swaps as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Investments in Unconsolidated Trading Companies and Private Investment Companies   

Investments
in unconsolidated Trading Companies and Private Investment Companies represent cash and open trade equity invested in the
Trading and Private Investment Companies as well as by each Series and cumulative trading profits or losses allocated to each
Series by the Trading Companies and Private Investment Companies. Trading Companies and Private Investment Companies allocate
trading profits or losses on the basis of the proportion of each Series #146; capital allocated for trading to each
respective Trading Company, which bears no relationship to the amount of cash invested by a Series in the Trading Company and
Private Investment Companies. The Trading Companies are valued using the equity method of accounting, which approximates fair
value.

which are described in the following tables.

with Affiliates   

The
Managing Owner contributes funds to the Trust, with respect to the Series, in order to have a 1% interest ( Minimum Purchase Commitment ) in the aggregate capital,
profits and losses of all Series and in return will receive units designated as general units in the Series in which the Managing
Owner invests such funds. The general units may only be purchased by the Managing Owner and may be subject to no advisory fees
or advisory fees at reduced rates. Otherwise, the general units hold the same rights as the limited units. The Managing Owner
will make contributions to the Series of the Trust necessary to maintain at least a 1% interest in the aggregate capital, profits
and losses of the combined Series of the Trust. Such contribution was made by the Managing Owner before trading commenced for
the Trust and will be maintained throughout the existence of the Trust, and the Managing Owner will make such purchases as are
necessary to effect this requirement. Additionally, the Managing Owner agreed with certain regulatory bodies to maintain a 1%
interest specifically in the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP and 2a Units, aggregated, and each of the Equinox Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund. The 1% interest in these specific
Series is included in computing the Minimum Purchase Commitment in aggregate capital. In addition to the general units the Managing
Owner receives in respect of its Minimum Purchase Commitment, the Managing Owner may purchase limited units in any Series as a
Limited Owner. Principals of the Managing Owner or affiliates are allowed to own beneficial interests in the Trust, with respect
to the Series, as well. All Units purchased by the Managing Owner are held for investment purposes only and not for resale. The
Managing Owner may make purchases or redemptions at any time on the same terms as any Limited Owner. The Trust has and will continue
to have certain relationships with the Managing Owner and its affiliates.

Expenses   

Management
Fees  Each Series of Units pays to the Managing Owner a monthly management fee equal to a percentage of the nominal assets
of such Series, calculated on a daily basis. The total amount of assets of a series allocated to trading advisors and/or reference
programs, including (i) actual funds deposited in accounts directed by the trading advisors or deposited as margin in respect
of swaps or other derivative instruments referencing a reference program plus (ii) any notional equity allocated to the trading
advisors and any reference programs, is referred to herein as the  nominal assets  of the series. The annual rate
of the management fee is: 0.5% for the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3, 1.0% for the Equinox Frontier
Balanced Fund Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a, 2.0% for the Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity
Fund Class 1a, Class 2a, and Class 3a and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, 0.75% for Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, 2.5% for
the Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund and Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and 3.5% for the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund
Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such management fees to the Trading Advisor(s) and/or
waive (up to the percentage specified) any such management fee to the extent any related management fee is paid by a trading company
or estimated management fee is embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument. Any management fee embedded in a swap or other
derivative instrument may be greater or less than the management fee that would otherwise be charged to the series by the Managing
Owner. As of the date of this Form 10-Q, the trading advisor for a series that has invested in a swap has not received any management
fees directly from the series for such swap, and instead the relevant trading advisor receives compensation via the fees embedded
in the swap.  

The
management fee as a percentage of the applicable series  net asset value will be greater than the percentage indicated above
to the extent that the nominal assets of the series exceeds its net asset value. The managing owner expects that the nominal assets
of each series will generally be maintained at a level in excess of the net asset value of such series and such excess may be
substantial to the extent the managing owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility.  

Trading
Fees  In connection with each Series  trading activities, from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016,
the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Classes 2 and 3), Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund,
Equinox Frontier Winton Fund and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund paid to the Managing Owner a trading fee, or FCM Fee, of up to
0.75% of such Series  NAV, calculated daily ; thereafter each of the Series pays to the Managing Owner a FCM Fee of up to
0.75% of nominal assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments in commodity pools available on the Galaxy
Plus Platform. Until April 28, 2016, the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Classes
1a, 2a and 3a) and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund paid to the Managing Owner a trading fee, or FCM Fee, of up to 2.25% and a custodial/due
diligence fee of 0.12% of such Series  NAV, calculated daily: thereafter each of such Series pays to the Managing Owner a
trading fee, or FCM Fee, of up to 2.25% of nominal assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments in commodity
pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform, and a custodial/due diligence fee of 0.12% of such Series  NAV, calculated daily.  

Incentive
Fees  The Series pay to the Managing Owner an incentive fee of a certain percentage of new net trading profits generated
by such Series, monthly or quarterly. Because the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox Frontier
Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund may each employ multiple Trading Advisors, these Series will pay the
Managing Owner a monthly incentive fee calculated on a Trading Advisor by Trading Advisor basis. It is therefore possible that
in any given period the Series may pay incentive fees to the Managing Owner for one or more Trading Advisors while each of these
Series as a whole experiences losses. The incentive fee is 25% for the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund and the Equinox Frontier
Diversified Fund and 20% for the Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, Equinox
Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such incentive
fees to the Trading Advisor(s) for such Series.  

Service
Fees  In addition, with respect to Class 1 and Class 1a Units of each Series, as applicable, the Series pays monthly
or quarterly to the Managing Owner a service fee of up to 3% of NAV annually, which the Managing Owner pays to selling agents
of the Trust, with respect to the Series.

The
following table summarizes fees payable to the Managing Owner as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

With
respect to the service fees, the initial service fee (for the first 12 months) relating to a purchase of Units by an investor
is prepaid by the Managing Owner to the relevant selling agent in the month following such purchase and is reimbursed therefore
by the Series monthly in arrears in an amount based upon a corresponding percentage of NAV, calculated daily. Consequently, the
Managing Owner bears the risk and the benefit of the upside potential of any difference between the amount of the initial service
fee prepaid by it and the amount of the reimbursement thereof, which may result from variations in NAV over the following 12 months.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, amounts paid or owed to the Managing Owner for the difference in monthly service fees
from prepaid initial service fees were $5,794 for the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, $25 for the Equinox Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund, $1,727 for the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, $25 for the Equinox Frontier Select Fund, $597 for the Equinox
Frontier Heritage Fund, $13,505 for the Equinox Frontier Winton Fund and $362 for the Equinox Frontier Masters Fund.  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, amounts paid or owed to the Managing Owner for the difference
in monthly service fees from prepaid initial service fees were $6,824 for the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, $648 for the Equinox
Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $876 for the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, $361 for the Equinox Frontier Select Fund,
$990 for the Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, $11,602 for the Equinox Frontier Winton Fund and $994 for the Equinox Frontier Masters
Fund.  

Aggregate interest income from all sources, including U.S. Treasury
Securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to the first 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing
Owner by the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1, and Class 2 only), Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Select
Fund, and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund and Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a only), 20% of
the total interest allocated to each Series was paid to the Managing Owner from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016; thereafter
100% of the interest is retained by the respective Series.

7.      Financial
Highlights   

The
following information presents the financial highlights of the Trust, with respect to the Series, for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(1)    Interest
                                         income and expenses per unit are calculated by dividing these amounts by the average
                                         number of units outstanding during the period. The net gain/(loss) on investments, net
                                         of non-controlling interests is a balancing amount necessary to reconcile the change
                                         in net asset value per unit with the other per unit information.  

(2)    Impact
                                         of incentive fee computed using average net assets, otherwise computed using average
                                         units outstanding during the period prior to the effects of any non-controlling transactions.
                                         An owner s total returns may vary from the above returns based on the timing of
                                         contributions and withdrawals. Total returns are not annualized.

8.      Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities   

The
Series  primary business is to engage in speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including
interbank foreign currencies), options contracts and other derivative instruments (including swap contracts). The Series do not
enter into or hold positions for hedging purposes as defined under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging  ( ASC 815 ).
The detail of the fair value of the Series  derivatives by instrument types as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
is included in the Condensed Schedules of Investments. See Note 4 for further disclosure related to each Series  position
in swap contracts.

Certain
financial instruments and derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the statements of financial condition under GAAP.
The Series  open trade equity/(deficit), options written, and receivables from futures commissions merchants (each, an  FCM )
are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements and meet the GAAP guidance to qualify for offset. A master
netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable
in the event of a default or bankruptcy. The Series  policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements
on a net basis on the statements of financial condition.  

The
following tables present gross and net information about the Series  assets and liabilities subject to master netting arrangements
as disclosed on the statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Trading Activities and Related Risks    

The
purchase and sale of futures and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with FCMs. Additional deposits may be necessary
for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the  Commodity Exchange Act ) requires an
FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and
other property (for example, U.S. treasury bills) deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds
subject to the FCM s segregation requirements. In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro
rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other
property deposited.  

The
term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on
the statements of financial condition, may result in future obligation or loss in excess of the amount paid by the Series for
a particular investment. Each Trading Company expects to trade in futures, options, forward and swap contracts and will therefore
be a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts,
there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility,
resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures positions held by a Trading
Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset
such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets and the holders of Units of such Series would
realize a 100% loss. The Managing Owner will seek to minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions and the
level of diversification of each Trading Advisor s portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor s margin-to-equity
ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35% although the actual ratio could be higher or lower from time to time.  

In
addition to market risk, trading futures, forward and swap contracts entails credit risk that a counterparty will not be able
to meet its obligations to a Trading Company. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign
exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of
the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and,
as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members,
like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges,
in contrast to U.S. exchanges, are principals  markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the individual
counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction, and not of the exchange or clearing corporation.
In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty.  

In
the case of forward contracts traded on the interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on exchanges. The counterparty is generally
a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty
credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy.
All positions of each Trading Company will be valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing
member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company.  

The
Managing Owner has established procedures to actively monitor and minimize market and credit risks. The Limited Owners bear the
risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions
and redemptions received.  

10.
Indemnifications and Guarantees noted in Management Discussion and Analysis    

The
Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, and commodity trading advisers,
among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under
such agreements, except for gross negligence or bad faith. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements.
The Trust s individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may
be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.
Maximum exposure is unfulfilled obligations of the Series up to the amount of equity at risk with UBS Securities LLC of the referenced
Series as allocated from the Trading Company. The Series have not recorded any liability for the guarantees in the accompanying
financial statements as it expects any possibility of losses to be remote.  

The
Trust has guaranteed the obligations of the Trading Companies under the customer agreements with UBS Securities LLC as Clearing
Broker. In the event that one Series of the Trust is unable to meet its obligations to UBS Securities LLC, the assets of the other
Series will be available to UBS Securities LLC as part of the guarantee, but only to the extent of such Series  pro rata
allocation to the Trading Company. The Series have not recorded any liability for the indemnifications in the accompanying financial
statement, as it expects any possibility of losses to be remote.  

11.
 Subsequent Events    

The
Trust had a change in its transfer agency provider.  Gemini Fund Services, LLC has taken on the role of transfer agent
as of October 14, 2016.  Prior to this date, Phoenix American Financial Services, Inc. had acted as the Trust s transfer
agent.

1.
Organization and Purpose    

Equinox
Frontier Funds, which is referred to in this report as the  Trust , was formed on August 8, 2003, as a Delaware
statutory trust. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation   4.10(d)(2). The Trust has
authority to issue separate Series of Units pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are valued
and accounted for separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. It is managed by the Managing Owner.  

Purchasers
of Units are Limited Owners of the Trust with respect to beneficial interests of the Series  Units purchased. The Trust
Act provides that, except as otherwise provided in the second amended and restated declaration of trust and trust agreement dated
December 9, 2013, by and among the Managing Owner, Wilmington Trust Company as trustee and the unitholders, as amended from
time to time ( Trust Agreement ), unitholders of the Trustwill have the same limitation of liability as do stockholders
of private corporations organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Trust Agreement confers substantially
the same limited liability, and contains the same limited exceptions thereto, as would a limited partnership agreement for a Delaware
limited partnership engaged in like transactions as the Trust. In addition, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Managing Owner
of the Trust is liable for obligations of a Series in excess of that Series  assets. Limited owners do not have any such
liability. The Managing Owner will make contributions to the Series of the Trust necessary to maintain at least a 1% interest
in the aggregate capital, profits and losses of all Series.  

The
Trust has been organized to pool investor funds for the purpose of trading in the U.S. and international markets for currencies,
interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products, precious and base metals and other commodities. The Trust may
also engage in futures contracts, forwards, option contracts and other interest in derivative instruments, including swap contracts.  

The
Trust has seven (7) separate and distinct Series of Units issued and outstanding: Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, Equinox
Frontier Winton Fund, and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund. The Trust financial statements are comprised of unitized Series which
are consolidated into the Trust financial statements. However, the consolidated Trust does not issue units.  

The
Trust, with respect to each Series:  

engages
in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including interbank foreign currencies),  options
contracts and other derivative instruments (including swap contracts), and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions;  

allocates
funds to a limited liability trading company or companies ( Trading Company  or  Trading Companies ) and
Galaxy Plus entities ( Galaxy Plus ). Except as otherwise described in these notes, each Trading Company and Galaxy
Plus entity has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent commodity trading advisor(s), or each, a Trading Advisor,
that will manage all or a portion of such Trading Company s and Galaxy Plus assets and make the trading decisions for the
assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. Each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will
segregate its assets from any other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity;  

maintains
separate, distinct records for each Series, and accounts for the assets of each Series separately from the other Series;  

calculates
the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) of its Units for each Series separately from the other Series;  

has
an investment objective of increasing the value of each Series  Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while managing
risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments;  

maintains each Series of Units in between two to seven sub-classes Class
1, Class 1AP, Class 1a, Class 2, Class 2a, Class 3, and Class 3a. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Equinox
Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, and Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund are charged a service
fee of up to two percent (2.0%) annually of the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased,
for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at
an annual rate of up to two percent (2.0%) of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing
Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that
investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following
the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption fee of up to two percent (2.0%) of the purchase price at which
such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors
who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox Frontier
Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier Winton Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent (3.0%) annually of the NAV (of the
purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class
1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent (3.0%) of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling
agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their
Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are
subject to a redemption fee of up to three percent (3.0%) of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the
Managing Owner for the then-unamortized balance of the prepaid initial service fee. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units
of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an ongoing service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent (0.5%) annually of the
NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which 0.25% will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Equinox Frontier
Diversified Fund, and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until
such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are subject to the fee limitation are reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable
Series. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other services
rendered and expenses incurred by such selling agents; and  

67  

           Table of Contents            

all payments made to selling agents who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
( FINRA ) and their associated persons that constitute underwriting compensation will be subject to the limitations
set forth in Rule 2310(b)(4)(B)(ii) (formerly Rule 2810(b)(4)(B)(ii)) of the Conduct Rules of FINRA ( Rule 2310 ).
An investor s Class 1 Units or Class 2 Units of any Series, or Class 1a Units or Class 2a Units of the Equinox Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund or Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund will be classified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of such Series, as applicable,
when the Managing Owner determines that the fee limitation with respect to such Units has been reached or will be reached. The
service fee limit applicable to each unit sold is reached upon the earlier of when (i) the aggregate initial and ongoing service
fees received by the selling agent with respect to such unit equals 9% of the purchase price of such unit or (ii) the aggregate
underwriting compensation (determined in accordance with FINRA Rule 2310) paid in respect of such unit totals 10% of the purchase
price of such unit. No service fees are paid with respect to Class 3 or Class 3a Units. Units of any Class in a Series may be redeemed,
in whole or in part, on a daily basis, at the then current NAV per Unit for such Series on the day of the week after the date the
Managing Owner is in receipt of a redemption request for at least one (1) Business Day to be received by the Managing Owner
prior to 4:00 PM in New York.  

The
assets of any particular Series include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the Trust
on account of and for the benefit of that Series. Under the  Inter-Series Limitation on Liability  expressly provided
for under Section 3804(a) of the Trust Act, separate and distinct records of the cash and equivalents, although pooled for maximizing
returns, are maintained in the books and records of each Series.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Trust, with respect to the
Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund separates Units into three separate Classes Class 1,
Class 2, and Class 3. The Trust, with respect to the Equinox Frontier Select Fund, Equinox Frontier Winton Fund and Equinox Frontier
Heritage Fund separates Units into three separate Classes Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. The Trust, with respect to the Equinox
Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund separates Units into a maximum of five separate Classes Class 1a, Class 2, Class 3, Class
2a and Class 3a. The Trust, with respect to the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund separates Units into a maximum of five Classes Class
1, Class 1AP, Class 2, Class 2A and Class 3A. Between April 15, 2016 and September 30, 2016, a portion of the interests in Frontier
Trading Company I, LLC and all of the interests in Frontier Trading Company VII, LLC, and Frontier Trading Company XXIII, LLC held
by Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, and Equinox Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund were exchanged for equivalent interests in Galaxy Plus.  The assets of Frontier Trading Company I, LLC, which
included exposure to Quantmetrics Capital Management LLP s Multi-Strategy Program, Quantitative Investment Management, LLC s
Quantitative Global Program, Quest Partners LLC s Quest Tracker Index Program, Chesapeake Capital Management, LLC s
Diversified Program, and Doherty Advisors LLC s Relative Value Moderate Program,  the assets of Frontier Trading Company
VII, LLC, which included exposure to Emil van Essen LLC s Multi-Strategy Program, Red Oak Commodity Advisors, Inc. s
Fundamental Diversified Program, Rosetta Capital Management, LLC s Rosetta Trading Program, and Landmark Trading Company s
Landmark Program, and the assets of Frontier Trading Company XXIII, LLC, which included exposure to  Fort L.P. s
Global Contrarian Program have been transferred to individual Master Funds in Galaxy Plus.   Each Master Fund is sponsored
and operated by Gemini Alternative Funds, LLC.  The Sponsor has contracted with the trading advisors to manage the portfolios
of the Master Funds pursuant to the advisors  respective program.  For those Series that invest in Galaxy Plus, approximately
30-70% of those Series  assets are used to support the margin requirements of the Master Funds.  The remaining assets
of the Series are split between investments in Trading Companies and a pooled cash management account that invests primarily in
U.S. Treasury securities.  For those Series that do not invest in Galaxy Plus, their assets are split between investments
in Trading Companies and investments in the pooled cash management account.  

The
Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies,
and commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their
individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence or bad faith.

Significant Accounting Policies    

The
following are the significant accounting policies of the Trust.  

Basis

Consolidation  The
Series, through investing in the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus, authorize certain Trading Advisors to place trades and manage
assets at pre-determined investment levels. The Trading Companies were organized by the Managing Owner for the purpose of investing
in commodities interests and derivative instruments, and have no operating income or expenses, except for trading income and expenses,
all of which is allocated to the Series. Galaxy Plus is a series of Delaware limited liability companies, sponsored by Gemini
Alternative Funds, LLC, that create exposure to a variety of third party professional managed futures and foreign exchange advisors.
Galaxy Plus is available to qualified high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities in which a Series has a controlling and majority equity interest are consolidated by such Series. Investments in Trading
Companies and Galaxy Plus entities in which a Series does not have a controlling and majority interest are accounted for under
the equity method, which approximates fair value. Fair value represents the proportionate share of the Series  interest
in the NAV in a Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The equity interest held by Series of the Trust is shown as investments
in unconsolidated Trading Companies or investments in private investment companies in the statements of financial condition. The
income or loss attributable thereto in proportion of investment level is shown in the statements of operations as change in fair
value of investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies or net unrealized gain/(loss) on private investment companies.  

As of September 30, 2016, the consolidated balance sheet of Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund included the assets
and liabilities of its majority owned Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. These Trading Companies include Frontier Trading

with the results of Galaxy Plus Fund - LRR Feeder Fund (522) LLC consolidated through June 30, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP may require the Managing Owner to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The valuation
of swap contracts requires significant estimates as well as the valuation of certain other investments. Please refer to Note 3
for discussion of valuation methodology. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material.

           Table of Contents            

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash and overnight investments in interest-bearing demand deposits
held at banks with original maturities of three months or less. This cash is not restricted.  

Interest
Income  U.S. Treasury Securities are pooled for purposes of maximizing returns on these assets to investors of all Series.
Interest income from pooled cash management assets is recognized on the accrual basis and allocated daily to each Series based
upon its daily proportion of ownership of the pool. Aggregate interest income from all sources, including U.S. Treasuries and
assets held at a futures commission merchant ( FCM ), of up to two percentage points of the aggregate percentage yield
(annualized) of net asset value less any fair market value related to swaps, is paid to the Managing Owner by the Equinox Frontier
Balanced Fund (Class 1, and Class 2 only), Equinox Frontier Select Fund, Equinox Frontier Winton Fund and Equinox Frontier Heritage
Fund. For the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund and
Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a only), 20% of the total interest allocated to each Series was paid
to the Managing Owner from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016, thereafter 100% of the interest is retained by the respective
Series. All interest not paid to the Managing Owner is interest income to the Series, and shown net on the statement of operations.  

U.S.
Treasury Securities  U.S. Treasury Securities are reported at fair value as Level 1 inputs under ASC 820,  Fair Value   Measurements
and Disclosures (  ASC 820 ). The Trust values U.S. Treasury Securities at fair value and records the daily change
in value in the consolidated statements of operations as net unrealized gain/(loss) on U.S. Treasury securities. Accrued interest
is reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as interest receivable.  

Receivable
From Futures Commission Merchants  The Trust deposits assets with a FCM subject to CFTC regulations and various exchange
and broker requirements. Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of cash with such FCM. The Trust earns interest income
on its assets deposited with the FCM.  

Investment
Transactions  Futures, options on futures, forward and swap contracts are recorded on a trade date basis and realized
gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between
contract trade price and market price) are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition as a net unrealized
gain or loss, as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in accordance with FASB ASC 210,  Balance Sheet
( ASC 210  ) and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-01,  Balance Sheet (Topic 210 ).  

Any
change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Fair
value of exchange-traded contracts is based upon exchange settlement prices. Fair value of non-exchange-traded contracts is based
on third party quoted dealer values on the interbank market. For U.S. Treasury securities, interest was recognized in the period
earned and the instruments were marked-to-market daily based on third party information. Transaction costs are recognized as incurred
and reflected separately in the consolidated statements of operations.  

Foreign
Currency Transactions  The Series of the Trust s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, they transact
business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Series of the Trust do not isolate that portion of the results of operations
resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities
held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized or unrealized gain or loss from investments.  

Allocation
of Earnings  Each Series of the Trust may maintain three to seven classes of Units Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class
1a, Class 2a, Class 3a and Class 1AP. All classes have identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights and the same terms
and conditions, except that fees charged to a Class or Series differ as described below. Revenues, expenses (other than expenses
attributable to a specific class), and realized and unrealized trading gains and losses of each Series are allocated daily to
Class 1, Class 1a, Class 2, Class 2a, Class 3, Class 3a and Class 1AP Units based on each Class  respective owners 
capital balances as applicable to the classes maintained by the Series.  

Each
Series allocates funds to an affiliated Trading Company, or Companies, of the Trust, or Galaxy Plus. Each Trading Company allocates
all of its daily trading gains or losses to the Series in proportion to each Series  ownership trading level interest in
the Trading Company, adjusted on a daily basis (except for Trading Advisors and other investments such as Swaps that are directly
allocated to a specific series). Likewise, trading gains and losses earned and incurred by the Series through their investments
in Galaxy Plus entities are allocated to those series on a daily basis. The allocation of gains and losses in Galaxy Plus entities
are based on each series pro-rata shares of the trading level of that entity which is updated at the beginning of each month or
more frequently if there is a subscription or redemption activity in the entity. The value of all open contracts and cash held
at clearing brokers is similarly allocated to the Series in proportion to each Series  funds allocated to the Trading Companies
or Galaxy Plus entities.

           Table of Contents            

Investments
and Swaps  The Trust records investment transactions on a trade date basis and all investments are recorded at fair value,
with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on investments in the statements
of operations. Certain Series of the Trust strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected
at the discretion of the Managing Owner. Swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns linked
to those produced by one or more underlying investment products or indices. In a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the
returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined investments or instruments.
The gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are calculated with respect to a  notional
amount  (i.e., the amount of value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate, return, or other
amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of securities. The valuation of swap contracts
requires significant estimates. Swap contracts are reported at fair value based upon daily reports from the counterparty. The
Managing Owner reviews and approves current day pricing of the CTA positions, as received from the counterparty which includes
intra-day volatility and volume and daily index performance, that is used to determine a daily fair value NAV for the swap contracts.  

Income
Taxes  The Trust applies the provisions of ASC 740  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), which provides guidance
for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. This interpretation
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Trust s financial
statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable
tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the Trust s level not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not 
threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The Managing Owner has concluded there is no tax
expense, interest or penalties to be recorded by the Trust for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2012 through 2016 tax years
generally remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.  

In
the opinion of the Managing Owner, (i) the Trust is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes and,
assuming that at least 90% of the gross income of the Trust constitutes  qualifying income  within the meaning of
Section 7704(d) of the Code, (ii) the Trust is not a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation, and (iii) the
discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading  U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  correctly
summarizes the material Federal income tax consequences as of the date of the Prospectus to potential U.S. Limited Owners of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of Series Units of the Trust.  

Fees
and Expenses  All management fees, incentive fees, service fees and trading fees of the Trust are paid to the Managing
Owner. It is the responsibility of the Managing Owner to pay all Trading Advisor management and incentive fees, Selling Agent
Service fees and all other operating expenses and continuing offering costs of the Trust.  

Service Fees    The
Trust may maintain each Series of Units in three to seven sub-classes Class 1, Class 1AP, Class 1a, Class 2, Class 2a, Class
3, and Class 3a. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund, and Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund are charged a service fee of up to two percent (2.0%) annually of
the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling
such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to two percent (2.0%)
of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the
selling agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion
of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase
are subject to a redemption fee of up to two percent (2.0%) of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse
the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or
Class 1a Units of Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier
Winton Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent (3.0%) annually of the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the
initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial
service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent (3.0%) of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or
Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents by the Managing Owner
in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units
of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption fee
of up to three percent (3.0%) of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
balance of the prepaid initial service fee. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an
ongoing service fee to Selling Agents of up to one half percent (0.5%) annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of
which 0.25% will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund and Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which
are subject to the fee limitation are reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series for administrative purposes.
Currently the service fee is not charged to Class 1AP investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional
fees and expenses for administrative and other services rendered and expenses incurred by such Selling Agents.  

These
service fees are part of the offering costs of the Trust, which include registration and filing fees, legal and blue sky expenses,
accounting and audit, printing, marketing support and other offering costs which are borne by the Managing Owner. With respect
to the service fees, the initial service fee (for the first 12 months) relating to a purchase of Class 1 and Class 1a Units by
an investor is prepaid by the Managing Owner to the relevant selling agent in the month following such purchase and is reimbursed
for such payment by the Series monthly in arrears in an amount based upon a corresponding percentage of NAV, calculated daily.
Consequently, the Managing Owner bears the risk of the downside and enjoys the benefit of the upside potential of any difference
between the amount of the initial service fee prepaid by it and the amount of the reimbursement thereof, which may result from
variations in NAV over the following 12 months.

Pending
Owner Additions  Funds received for new subscriptions and for additions to existing owner interests are recorded as capital
additions at the NAV per unit of the second business day following receipt.  

Reclassification
   Certain amounts in the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation. None
of the reclasses had an impact on the NAV or performance of the Series.  

Subsequent
Events  The Trust follows the provisions of ASC 855,  Subsequent Events , which establishes general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date and up through the date the financial statements
are issued.

Fair Value Measurements    

In
connection with the valuation of investments the Trust applies ASC 820. ASC 820 provides clarification that when a quoted price
in an active market for the identical asset or liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value
using certain techniques. ASC 820 also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, a reporting entity
is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents
the transfer of an asset or liability. ASC 820 also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset
or liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical asset or liability when traded as an asset in an active
market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements.  

Level
1 Inputs     

Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement
date.  

Level
2 Inputs     

Inputs
other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar financial assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar financial
assets in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the financial assets or inputs
that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.  

Level
3 Inputs     

Unobservable
inputs for determining the fair value of financial assets that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the financial asset.  

The
Trust uses the following methodologies to value instruments within its financial asset portfolio at fair value:  

Trading
Securities.  These instruments include U.S. Treasury securities and open trade equity positions (futures contracts) that are
actively traded on public markets with quoted pricing for corroboration. U.S. Treasury securities and futures contracts are reported
at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Trading securities instruments further include open trade equity positions (trading options
and currency forwards) that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets that are not traded on active markets. Trading options
and currency forwards are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs.  

Swap
Contracts . Certain Series of the Trust strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected
at the direction of the Managing Owner. Swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns linked
to those produced by one or more investment products or indices. In a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the returns
(or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined investments or instruments. The
gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are calculated with respect to a  notional amount 
(i.e., the amount of value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate, return, or other amount to
be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of securities. Swap contracts are reported at fair value
based upon daily reports from the counterparty. The Managing Owner reviews and approves current day pricing of the CTA positions,
as received from the counterparty which includes intra-day volatility and volume and daily index performance, that is used to
determine a daily fair value NAV for the swap contracts.  

72  

           Table of Contents            

The
Managing Owner has chartered a valuation committee to provide oversight of the valuation process for the Series. The valuation
committee meets at least monthly to discuss the valuation process and any valuation issues that may arise. The valuation committee
is comprised of senior members of the Managing Owner s management team with varying areas of expertise that add value to
the committee. The valuation committee reports to both the Managing Owner s Management Committee and the Trust s Executive
Committee. The valuation committee further remains in communication with the Managing Owner s Due Diligence Committee that
provides ongoing counterparty risk monitoring of the swap counterparties. The valuation committee s designee monitors daily
pricing valuation provided by the swap. The Managing Owner s valuation committee monitors some additional input factors
such as liquidity, volatility, and counterparty risk in order to further review the valuations provide by the pricing service  

The
following table summarizes the instruments that comprise the Trust s financial asset portfolio, in aggregate, measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, segregated by the level of valuation inputs within the fair value
hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:

The
Trust assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual
date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Trust s accounting policy regarding
the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Trust did not transfer any assets between Levels 1, 2 and 3.

4. Swaps Contracts   

In
addition to authorizing Trading Advisors to manage pre-determined investment levels of futures and forward contracts,
certain Series of the Trust will strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected at the
direction of the Managing Owner. Total return swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns
linked to those produced by one or more investment products or indices. In a typical total return swap, two parties agree to
exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined
investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or  swapped  between the parties are calculated with
respect to a  notional amount  (i.e., the amount or value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular
interest rate, return, or other amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a  basket  of
securities.  

The
Trust s investment in swaps will likely differ substantially over time due to cash flows, portfolio management decisions
and market movements. The swaps serve to diversify the investment holdings of the Trust and to provide access to programs and
advisors that would not be otherwise available to the Trust, and are not used for hedging purposes.  

The
Managing Owner follows a procedure in selecting well-established financial institutions which the Managing Owner, in its sole
discretion, considers to be reputable, reliable, financially responsible and well established to act as swap counterparties. The
procedure includes due diligence review of documentation on all new and existing financial institution counterparties prior to
initiation of the relationship, and quarterly ongoing review during the relationship, to ensure that counterparties meet the Managing
Owner s minimum credit requirements, the counterparty average rating being no less than an investment grade rating as defined
by the rating agencies. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 14.26% or $36,579,979 and 16.71% or $40,136,065,
respectively, of the Trust s assets were deposited with over-the-counter counterparties in order to initiate and maintain
swaps and is recorded as Swap Contracts, at fair value on the Statements of Financial Condition of the Trust. This cash held with
the counterparty is not restricted.  

The
Trust strategically invests assets in one or more swaps linked to certain underlying investments or indices at the direction of
the Managing Owner. The Trading Company in which the assets of the Trust will be invested will not own any of the investments
or indices referenced by any swap entered into by the Trust. In addition, neither the swap counterparty nor any advisor referenced
by any such swap is a Trading Advisor to the Trust.

           Table of Contents            

The
Trust had invested in the following swap contracts as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

5.
Transactions with Affiliates    

The
Managing Owner contributes funds to the Trust in order to have a 1% interest in the aggregate capital, profits and losses and
in return will receive units designated as general units in the Series of the Trust in which the Managing Owner invests such funds.
The general units may only be purchased by the Managing Owner and may be subject to no advisory fees or management advisory fees
at reduced rates. Otherwise, the general units hold the same rights as the limited units. The Managing Owner is required to maintain
at least a 1% interest ( Minimum Purchase Commitment ) in the aggregate capital, profits and losses of the Trust so
long as it is acting as the Managing Owner of the Trust. Such contribution was made by the Managing Owner before trading commenced
for the Trust and will be maintained throughout the existence of the Trust, and the Managing Owner will make such purchases as
are necessary to effect this requirement. Additionally, the Managing Owner agreed with certain regulatory bodies to maintain a
1% interest specifically in the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP Units and Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund Class 2a Units,
aggregated, and each of the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, and Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund. The 1% interest in these specific Series of the Trust is included in computing the Minimum Purchase Commitment in
aggregate capital. In addition to the general units the Managing Owner receives in respect of its Minimum Purchase Commitment,
the Managing Owner may purchase limited units in any Series as a Limited Owner. Principals of the Managing Owner or affiliates
are allowed to own beneficial interests in the Trust, as well. All units purchased by the Managing Owner are held for investment
purposes only and not for resale. The Managing Owner may make purchases or redemptions at any time on the same terms as any Limited
Owner. The Trust has and will continue to have certain relationships with the Managing Owner and its affiliates.  

Expenses

Management
Fees  Each Series of Units pays to the Managing Owner a monthly management fee equal to a percentage of the nominal assets
of such Series, calculated on a daily basis. The total amount of assets of a series allocated to trading advisors and/or reference
programs, including (i) actual funds deposited in accounts directed by the trading advisors or deposited as margin in respect
of swaps or other derivative instruments referencing a reference program plus (ii) any notional equity allocated to the trading
advisors and any reference programs, is referred to herein as the  nominal assets  of the series. The annual rate
of the management fee is: 0.5% for the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3, 1.0% for the Equinox Frontier
Balanced Fund Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a, 2.0% for the Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity
Fund Class 1a, Class 2a and Class 3a and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, 0.75% for Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund,
2.5% for the Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund and Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and 3.5% for the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity
Fund Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such management fees to the Trading
Advisor(s) and/or waive (up to the percentage specified) any such management fee to the extent any related management fee is paid
by a trading company or estimated management fee is embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument. Any management fee embedded
in a swap or other derivative instrument may be greater or less than the management fee that would otherwise be charged to the
series by the Managing Owner. As of the date of this Form 10-Q, the trading advisor for a series that has invested in a swap has
not received any management fees directly from the series for such swap, and instead the relevant trading advisor receives compensation
via the fees embedded in the swap.  

76  

           Table of Contents            

The
management fee as a percentage of the applicable series  net asset value will be greater than the percentage indicated above
to the extent that the nominal assets of the series exceeds its net asset value. The managing owner expects that the nominal assets
of each series will generally be maintained at a level in excess of the net asset value of such series and such excess may be
substantial to the extent the managing owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility.  

Trading
Fees  In connection with each Series  trading activities, from
January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016, the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Classes 2 and 3), Equinox Frontier Balanced
Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, Equinox Frontier Winton Fund and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund paid to the Managing Owner
a trading fee, or FCM Fee, of up to 0.75% of such Series  NAV, calculated daily ; thereafter each of the Series pays to the
Managing Owner a FCM Fee of up to 0.75% of nominal assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments in commodity
pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform. Until April 28, 2016, the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund (Classes 1a, 2a, and 3a) and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund paid to the Managing Owner a trading fee, or FCM Fee,
of up to 2.25% and a custodial/due diligence fee of 0.12% of such Series  NAV, calculated daily, thereafter each of such
Series pays to the Managing Owner a trading fee, or FCM Fee, of up to 2.25% of nominal assets allocated to the trading advisors,
including through investments in commodity pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform,and a custodial/due diligence fee of 0.12%
of such Series  NAV, calculated daily.  

Incentive
Fees  Some Series of the Trust pay to the Managing Owner an incentive fee of a certain percentage of new net trading
profits generated by such Series, monthly or quarterly. Because the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage
Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund may each employ multiple Trading Advisors,
these Series will pay the Managing Owner a monthly incentive fee calculated on a Trading Advisor by Trading Advisor basis. It
is therefore possible that in any given period the Series may pay incentive fees to the Managing Owner for one or more Trading
Advisors while each of these Series as a whole experiences losses. The incentive fee is 25% for the Equinox Frontier Balanced
Fund and the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund and 20% for the Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund, Equinox
Frontier Select Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Equinox Frontier Masters Fund. The Managing Owner may pay
all or a portion of such incentive fees to the Trading Advisor(s) for such Series.  

Service
Fees  In addition, with respect to Class 1 and Class 1a Units of each Series of the Trust, as applicable, the Series
pays monthly or quarterly to the Managing Owner a service fee of up to 3% annually, which the Managing Owner pays to selling agents
of the Trust.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Trust has a payable to the Managing Owner in the amounts of $1,124,950, $602,808, $, $78,424 and $262,654
for incentive fees, management fees, interest, trading fees, and service fees, respectively.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the Trust has a payable to the Managing Owner in the amounts of $382,136, $402,943, $162,121, $282,522
and $273,856 for incentive fees, management fees, interest, trading fees, and service fees, respectively.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Trust paid the Managing Owner $1,124,416, $1,181,056, $923,098 and $1,106,628 for
incentive fees, management fees, service fees, and trading fees, respectively.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Trust paid the Managing Owner $343,725, $1,244,029, $1,033,970 and $835,725for
incentive fees, management fees, service fees, and trading fees, respectively.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Trust paid the Managing Owner $4,200,079, $3,506,046, $2,785,220 and $2,928,452
for incentive fees, management fees, service fees, and trading fees, respectively.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Trust paid the Managing Owner $5,341,237, $3,813,217, $3,334,861 and
$2,643,574 for incentive fees, management fees, service fees, and trading fees, respectively.  

With
respect to the service fees, the initial service fee (for the first 12 months) relating to a purchase of Units by an investor
is prepaid by the Managing Owner to the relevant selling agent in the month following such purchase and is reimbursed therefore
by the Series monthly in arrears in an amount based upon a corresponding percentage of NAV, calculated daily. Consequently, the
Managing Owner bears the risk and enjoys the benefit of the upside potential of any difference between the amount of the initial
service fee prepaid by it and the amount of the reimbursement thereof, which may result from variations in NAV over the following
12 months. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounts received or receivable from the Managing Owner for the
difference in monthly service fees from the prepaid initial service fees were $12 and $22,295, respectively.

Aggregate interest income from all sources, including U.S. Treasury Securities assets net of premiums and
cash held at clearing brokers, of up to the first 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Equinox Frontier Balanced
Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund.
For the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, and Equinox
Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a only), 20% of the total interest allocated to each Series was paid to
the Managing Owner from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016; thereafter 100% of the interest is retained by the respective Series.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    

The
Trust s primary business is to engage in speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including
interbank foreign currencies), options contracts and other derivative instruments (including swap contracts). The Trust does not
enter into or hold positions for hedging purposes as defined under ASC 815. The detail of the fair value of the Trust s
derivatives by instrument types as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is included in the Consolidated Condensed Schedules
of Investments. See Note 4 for further disclosure related to the Trust s positions in swap contracts.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the monthly average of futures contracts bought was approximately 51,346 and 10,232, respectively and sold was approximately 50,577
and 10,304, respectively.

Certain
financial instruments and derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the statements of financial condition under GAAP.
The Trust s open trade equity/(deficit), options written, and receivables from futures commission merchants (each, an  FCM )
are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements and meet the GAAP guidance to qualify for offset. A master
netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable
in the event of a default or bankruptcy. The Trust s policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements
on a net basis on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  

The
following tables present gross and net information about the Trust s assets and liabilities subject the master netting arrangements
as disclosed on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

8.
Trading Activities and Related Risks    

The
purchase and sale of futures and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with FCMs. Additional deposits may be necessary
for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from
the FCM s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. treasury bills) deposited
with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the FCM s segregation requirements. In the
event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible
that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.  

The
term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on
the statements of financial condition, may result in future obligation or loss in excess of the amount paid by the Series for
a particular investment. Each Trading Company expects to trade in futures, options, forward and swap contracts and will therefore
be a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts,
there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility,
resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures positions held by a Trading
Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset
such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets and the holders of Units of such Series would
realize a 100% loss. The Managing Owner will seek to minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions and the
level of diversification of each Trading Advisor s portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor s margin-to-equity
ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35% although the actual ratio could be higher or lower from time to time.  

82  

           Table of Contents            

In
addition to market risk, trading futures, forward and swap contracts entails credit risk that a counterparty will not be able
to meet its obligations to a Trading Company. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign
exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of
the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and,
as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members,
like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges,
in contrast to U.S. exchanges, are principals  markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the individual
counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction, and not of the exchange or clearing corporation.
In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty.  

In
the case of forward contracts traded on the interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on exchanges. The counterparty is generally
a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty
credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy.
All positions of each Trading Company will be valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing
member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company.  

The
Managing Owner has established procedures to actively monitor and minimize market and credit risks. The Limited Owners bear the
risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions
and redemptions received.  

9.
Indemnifications and Guarantees    

The
Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, and commodity trading advisers,
among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under
such agreements, except for gross negligence or bad faith. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements.
The Trust s individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may
be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.
Maximum exposure is unfulfilled obligations of the Trust up to the amount of equity at risk with UBS Securities LLC. The Trust
has not recorded any liability for the guarantees in the accompanying financial statements as it expects any possibility of losses
to be remote.  

The
Trust has guaranteed the obligations of the trading companies under the customer agreements with UBS Securities LLC as Clearing
Broker. In the event that one Series of the Trust is unable to meet its obligations to UBS Securities LLC, the assets of the other
Series will be available to UBS Securities LLC as part of the guarantee, but only to the extent of such Series  pro rata
allocation to the trading company. The Trust has not recorded any liability for the indemnifications in the accompanying financial
statements as it expects any possibility of losses to be remote.

Subsequent Events    

The
Trust had a change in its transfer agency provider.  Gemini Fund Services, LLC has taken on the role of transfer agent
as of October 14, 2016.  Prior to this date, Phoenix American Financial Services, Inc. had acted as the Trust s transfer
agent.

2.      MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Introduction

The
following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about the Managing Owner s expectations of what may
happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject
to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking
statements as a result of many known or unknown factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in  Risk
Factors.  See also the  Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements  set forth at the beginning of this report.  

The
following discussion and tables should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in this quarterly report and our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Overview

The
Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed on August 8, 2003. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in
CFTC Regulation   4.10(d)(2). The Trust is authorized to issue multiple Series of Units, pursuant to the requirements of
the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are held and accounted for in separate and distinct records separately from the assets
of other Series. The Trust is managed by the Managing Owner, and its term will expire on December 31, 2053 (unless terminated
earlier in certain circumstances).  

The
Trust, with respect to each Series of Units, engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards
(including interbank foreign currencies), options contracts and other derivative instruments (including Swaps). The Trust allocates
funds to affiliated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities, each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent
Trading Advisor(s) that will manage all or a portion of the applicable Trading Company s or Galaxy Plus entity s assets,
and make the trading decisions for the assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company of Gemini Plus entity. The assets
of each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will be segregated from the assets of the other Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities. The Trust has an investment objective of increasing the value of the Units over the long term (capital appreciation),
while controlling risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and
to specific instruments (currencies). For additional overview of the Trust s structure and business activities, see Item 1.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates     

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP )
requires the Managing Owner to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the
Trust s financial statements. The Trust s most significant accounting policy, described below, includes the valuation
of its futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap contracts, U.S. treasury securities and investments in unconsolidated
Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities, as well as the carrying value of the custom time deposits. The majority of these investments
are exchange traded contracts valued upon exchange settlement prices or non-exchange traded contracts and obligations with valuation
based on third-party quoted dealer values on the Interbank market.  

The
Trust s other significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements.  

Investment
Transactions and Valuation    

The
Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and type of transactions processed and estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust s
financial statements and related disclosures and has adopted  Accounting Standard Codification (   ASC ) 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , and implemented the framework for measuring fair value for assets and liabilities.  

The
Trust utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation
of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange traded) contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other non-cash
assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or
comparable assets or liabilities. The Trust applies the valuation techniques in a consistent manner for each asset or liability.
The Trust records all investments at fair value in its Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value reported
as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments in the Statements of Operations.  

Inputs
to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Inputs
may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or
liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity s
own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on the best
information available in the circumstances.  

In
addition, the Trust monitors counterparty credit risk and incorporates any identified risk factors when assigning input levels
to underlying financial assets or liabilities. In that regard ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs
that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. A full disclosure of the fair value hierarchy is presented in Note 3 of the financial statements  Fair Value Measurements .

Selection
and Replacement of Trading Advisors    

The
managing owner is responsible for the selection, retention and termination of the trading advisors and reference programs on behalf
of each series. The actual allocation among trading advisors for each series will vary based upon the relative trading performance
of the trading advisors and/or reference programs, and the managing owner may otherwise vary such percentages from time to time
in its sole discretion. The managing owner will adjust its allocations and rebalance the portfolio of any series among trading
advisors to maintain weightings that it believes will most likely achieve capital growth within the investment guidelines of the
relevant series.  

The
managing owner utilizes certain quantitative and qualitative analysis in connection with the identification, evaluation and selection
of the trading advisors. The managing owner s proprietary and commercial analytical software programs and comprehensive
trading advisor database provide the quantitative basis for the trading advisor selection, portfolio implementation process, and
ongoing risk management, monitoring, and review.  

The
managing owner s research department is continually refining ways to assimilate vast amounts of trading advisor performance
data and due-diligence information. The proprietary and commercial database of alternative investment programs is always increasing.
Research team members regularly interact with trading advisors throughout the due diligence and monitoring process. Only those
programs that have met strict quantitative and qualitative review are considered as potential managers of client assets. Following
is a summary of the quantitative and qualitative analysis:  

Quantitative
Analysis    

The
managing owner s analytical software system applies a variety of statistical measures towards the evaluation of current
and historical advisor performance data. Statistical measures include but are not limited to: (1) risk/reward analysis, (2) time
window analysis, (3) risk analysis, (4) correlation analysis, (5) statistical overlays and (6) performance
cycle analysis.  

Qualitative
Analysis    

Although
quantitative analysis statistically identifies the top performing trading advisors, qualitative analysis plays a major role in
the trading advisor evaluation and final selection process. Each trading advisor in the managing owner s top decile universe
initially undergoes extensive qualitative review by the managing owner s research department, as well as continual monitoring.
This analysis generally includes, but is not limited to: (1) preliminary information and due diligence, (2) background
review, (3) onsite due diligence, (4) extensive due diligence questionnaires and (5) written review and periodic
updates. This information allows a thorough review of each trading advisor s trading philosophy, trading systems and corporate
structure.  

Multi-Manager
Approach    

A
multi-manager approach to portfolio management provides diversification of trading advisors and access to broader global markets.
Multiple trading advisors can provide diversification across trading methodologies, trading time horizons, and markets traded.
Additionally, multi-manager portfolios tend to provide a greater level of professional management with ongoing risk management
and review. The result can be more consistent returns with lower volatility.

As
of September 30, 2016, the allocation of the assets of each applicable Series of the Trust between the Trading Advisors was as
follows:  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources     

The
Trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering, and does not intend
to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Trust s business, it makes no capital expenditures and
has no capital assets that are not operating capital or assets.  

The
Managing Owner is responsible for the payment of all of the ordinary expenses associated with the organization of the Trust and
the offering of each Series of Units, except for the initial and ongoing service fee, if any, and no Series will be required to
reimburse these expenses. As a result, 100% of each Series  offering proceeds are initially available for that Series 
trading activities.  

86  

           Table of Contents            

A portion of each Trading Company s assets is used
as margin to maintain that Trading Company s forward currency contract positions, and another portion is deposited in cash
in segregated accounts in the name of each Trading Company maintained for each Trading Company at the clearing brokers in accordance
with CFTC segregation requirements. At June 30,2016, cash deposited at the clearing brokers was $123,501,103 for the Trust. The
clearing brokers are expected to credit each Trading Company with approximately 80%-100% of the interest earned on its average
net assets on deposit with the clearing brokers each month. Currently, with the Federal Funds target rate at 0.25% to 0.5%, this
amount is estimated to be 0.25%. In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest the non-margin
assets in U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or
by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority
granted by Congress or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills
and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash items such as money market funds and time deposits. Aggregate interest
income from all sources, including assets held at clearing brokers, of up to 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the
Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and Equinox
Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier
Masters Fund and Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a only), 20% of the total interest allocated to
the Series was paid to the Managing Owner from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016; thereafter 100% of the interest is retained
by the respective Series.. The amount reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a net basis.
Due to some classes not exceeding the 2% paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero.  

Approximately 10% to 30% of the Trust s assets are expected
to be committed as required margin for futures contracts and forwards and options trading and held by the respective broker, although
the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. treasury bills in segregated
accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations there under. Approximately 2% to 6% of
the Trust s assets are expected to be deposited with over-the-counter counterparties in order to initiate and maintain forward
and swap contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such
over-the-counter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities
or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparties. The remaining approximately
64% to 88% of the Trust s assets will normally be invested in cash equivalents and short-term investments, such as money
market funds and time deposits and held by the clearing broker, the over-the-counter counterparties and by U.S. federally chartered
banks. As of September 30, 2016, total cash and cash equivalents held at banking institutions were $1,139,165 for the Equinox Frontier
Diversified Fund, $0 the Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, $932,192 for the Equinox Frontier Masters Fund, $2,277,583
for the Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund, $472,330 for the Equinox Frontier Select Fund, $3,485,693 for the Equinox Frontier Winton
Fund, and $660,350 for the Equinox Frontier Heritage Fund.  

As
a commodity pool, the Trust has large cash positions. Such cash positions are used to pay margin for the trading of futures,
forwards and options, and also to pay redemptions. Generally, the Trust has not been forced to liquidate positions to fund
redemptions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Trust was able to pay all redemptions.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Risk     

The
term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on
the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. Each Trading Company trades in futures, forward and swap contracts
and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into
these contracts there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest
rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests
positions held by a Trading Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company
are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets and the holders of Units
of such Series would realize a 100% loss. The Managing Owner seeks to minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open
positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor s portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor s
margin-to-equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35% although the actual ratio could be higher or lower from time
to time.  

In
addition to market risk, trading futures, forward and swap contracts entails credit risk which is the risk that a counterparty
will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on
most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate
members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their
members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing
members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S.
exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges are principals  markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the
individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction and not of the exchange or clearing corporation.
In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty.  

87  

           Table of Contents            

In
the case of forward contracts and swaps traded on the interbank market, neither is traded on an exchange. The counterparty is
generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater
counterparty credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes
to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance
that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company.  

The
Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies,
and commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their
individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence or bad faith. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments
pursuant to these agreements. The Trust s individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects
the risk of loss to be remote.  

Disclosure
of Contractual Obligations     

The
business of the Trust is the speculative trading of commodity interests. The majority of the Trust s futures and forward
positions, which may be categorized as  purchase obligations  under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, are short-term. That
is, they are held for less than one year. Because the Trust does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital
lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Trust s
Statement of Financial Condition, a table of contractual obligations has not been presented.

The
returns for each Series and Class of Units for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and related information, are
discussed below. The activities of the Trust on a consolidated basis are explained through the activity of the underlying Series.
Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust on a consolidated basis.  

Each
Series had exposure to commodity interest positions within one or more sectors during nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the periods by, among other things, the relative performance
of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions
taken by the Series  Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For
certain of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts
the performance of the relevant Series  positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing Owner
using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses
chargeable to the Series) during the periods presented.

ITEM
                                         3.         QUANTITATIVE
                                         AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

The
Trust is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments which are held by the Trading Companies in which the Series
are invested are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of the Series  assets are subject
to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental,
to the Series  main line of business.  

Market
movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of each Trading Company s open positions and, consequently,
in each Series of the Trust s earnings and cash flow. The Trading Companies  and consequently the Series  market
risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity
price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the open positions and
the liquidity of the markets in which trades are made.  

Each
Trading Company rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently,
it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the past performance for any
Series is not necessarily indicative of the future results of such Series.  

Additional
risk of trading loss from investment in an unaffiliated Trading Company may result from the Managing Owner s inability to
directly control or stop trading in the event of exercise of certain withdrawal provisions in the investment agreement.  

The
Trading Companies  and consequently the Series  primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to
be used by the Trading Advisors for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any
one of which could cause the actual results of the Trust s and the Managing Owner s risk controls to differ materially
from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence
of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants,
increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures
and the risk management strategies of the Trading Companies and consequently the Trust. There can be no assurance that the Trading
Companies  current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies
will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment
in a Series.  

Quantitative
Market Risk      

   Trading
Risk    

The
Series  approximate risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by its trading advisors is quantified below in terms
of value at risk. Due to the Series  mark-to-market accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Series  (through
the Trading Companies) open positions is directly reflected in the Series  earnings, realized or unrealized.  

Exchange
maintenance margin requirements have been used by the Trust as the measure of its value at risk. Maintenance margin requirements
are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract
in 95% to 99% of any one-day interval. The maintenance margin levels are established by brokers, dealers and exchanges using historical
price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate
of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available
initial margin, because initial margin includes a credit risk component that is not relevant to value at risk.  

In
the case of market sensitive instruments that are not exchange-traded, including currencies and some energy products and metals,
the margin requirements for the equivalent futures positions have been used as value at risk. In those cases in which a futures-equivalent
margin is not available, dealers  margins have been used.  

In
the case of contracts denominated in foreign currencies, the value at risk figures include foreign currency margin amounts converted
into U.S. dollars with an incremental adjustment to reflect the exchange rate risk inherent to the Series, which is valued in
U.S. dollars, in expressing value at risk in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars.   

115  

           Table of Contents            

In
quantifying each Series  value at risk, 100% positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category
has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine
each trading category s aggregate value at risk. The diversification effects resulting from the fact that the Series 
positions held through the Trading Companies are rarely, if ever, 100% positively correlated have not been reflected.  

Value
at Risk by Market Sectors     

The
following tables present the trading value at risk associated with each Series  exposure to open positions (as held by the
Trading Companies) by market sector as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. All open position trading risk exposures
of the Series have been included in calculating the figures set forth below.

Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk    

The
face value of the market sector instruments held on behalf of the Series is typically many times the applicable maintenance margin
requirement, which generally ranges between approximately 1% and 10% of contract face value, as well as many times the capitalization
of the Series. The magnitude of each Series  open positions creates a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment
vehicles. Because of the size of their positions, certain market conditions, although unusual, but historically recurring from
time to time, could cause a Series to incur severe losses over a short period of time. The value at risk table above, as well
as the past performance of the Series, gives no indication of this risk of severe losses.  

Non-Trading
Risk     

The
Series have non-trading market risk on their foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances, as well as
the market risk they represent, are immaterial. The Series also have non-trading market risk as a result of investing a portion
of their available assets in U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest
by the U.S., or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant
to authority granted by Congress of the U.S. or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds,
U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash items such as money market funds, certificates
of deposit (under nine months) and time deposits. The market risk represented by these investments is also immaterial.  

Qualitative
Market Risk     

The
following are the primary trading risk exposures of the Series of the Trust as of September 30, 2016, by market sector.  

Interest
Rates    

Interest rate risk is one of the principal market exposures
of each Series. Interest rate movements directly affect the price of interest rate futures positions held and indirectly affect
the value of a Trading Company s stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative
interest rate movements between countries materially impact profitability. The primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate
fluctuations in the U.S. and the other G-7 countries. However, the Trading Companies also may take futures positions on the government
debt of smaller nations. The Managing Owner anticipates that G-7 interest rates will remain the primary market exposure of each
Trading Company and accordingly of each Series for the foreseeable future. The changes in interest rates which are expected to
have the most effect on the Series are changes in long-term, as opposed to short-term rates. Most of the speculative positions
to be held by the Trading Companies will be in medium- to long-term instruments. Consequently, even a material change in short-term
rates is expected to have little effect on the Series if the medium- to long-term rates remain steady. Aggregate interest income
from all sources, including assets held at clearing brokers, of up to 2% (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Equinox
Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Equinox Frontier Winton Fund, Equinox Frontier Select Fund, and Equinox Frontier
Heritage Fund. For the Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund, Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Equinox Frontier Masters
Fund and Equinox Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a only), 20% of the total interest allocated to each Series
was paid to the Managing Owner from January 1, 2016 through April 28, 2016; thereafter 100% of the interest is retained by the
respective Series. [In addition, if interest rates fall below 0.75%, the Managing Owner is paid the difference between the Trust s
annualized interest income that is allocated to each of such Series and 0.75%.] Interest income above what is paid to the Managing
Owner is retained by the Series. The amounts reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a
net basis. Due to some classes not exceeding the 2% paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero.

           Table of Contents            

Currencies

Exchange
rate risk is a significant market exposure of each Series of the Trust in general. For each Series of the Trust in general, currency
exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations that disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different
currencies and currency pairs. These fluctuations are influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic
conditions. The Trading Advisors on behalf of a Series trade in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates, which are
positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Managing Owner does not anticipate that the risk profile of the
Series  currency sector will change significantly in the future.  

Stock
Indices    

For
each Series, its primary equity exposure is equity price risk in the G-7 countries as well as other smaller jurisdictions. Each
Series of the Trust is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the major U.S., European and
Japanese indices.  

Metals

For
each Series, its metals market exposure is fluctuations in the price of both precious metals, including gold and silver, as well
as base metals including aluminum, copper, nickel and zinc. Some metals, such as gold, are used as surrogate stores of value,
in place of hard currency, and thus have currency or interest rate risk associated with them relative to their price in a specific
currency. Other metals, such as silver, platinum, copper and steel, have substantial industrial applications, and may be subject
to forces affecting industrial production and demand.  

Agriculturals/Softs

Each
Series may also invest in raw commodities and may thus have exposure to agricultural price movements, which are often directly
affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions or by political events in countries that comprise significant sources of commodity
supply.  

Energy

For
each Series its primary energy market exposure is in oil, gas and other energy product price movements, often resulting from political
developments and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. Oil and gas prices can be volatile and substantial profits and losses have
been and are expected to continue to be experienced in this market.  

Other
Trading Risks    

As
a result of leverage, small changes in the price of a Trading Company s positions may result in substantial losses for a
Series. Futures, forwards and options are typically traded on margin. This means that a small amount of capital can be used to
invest in contracts of much greater total value. The resulting leverage means that a relatively small change in the market price
of a contract can produce a substantial loss. Like other leveraged investments, any purchase or sale of a contract may result
in losses in excess of the amount invested in that contract. The Trading Companies may lose more than their initial margin deposits
on a trade.  

The
Trading Companies  trading is subject to execution risks. Market conditions may make it impossible for the Trading Advisors
to execute a buy or sell order at the desired price, or to close out an open position. Daily price fluctuation limits are established
by the exchanges and approved by the CFTC. When the market price of a contract reaches its daily price fluctuation limit, no trades
can be executed at prices outside the limit. The holder of a contract may therefore be locked into an adverse price movement for
several days or more and lose considerably more than the initial margin put up to establish the position. Thinly traded or illiquid
markets also can make it difficult or impossible to execute trades. The Trading Advisor s positions are subject to speculative
limits. The CFTC and domestic exchanges have established speculative position limits on the maximum futures position which any
person, or group of persons acting in concert, may hold or control in particular futures contracts or options on futures contracts
traded on U.S. commodity exchanges. Under current regulations, other accounts of the Trading Advisors are combined with the positions
held by them on behalf of the applicable Trading Company for position limit purposes. This trading could preclude additional trading
in these commodities by the Trading Advisors for the accounts of the Series.  

Systematic
strategies do not consider fundamental types of data and do not have the benefit of discretionary decision making. The assets
of the Series are allocated to Trading Advisors that rely on technical, systematic strategies that do not take into account factors
external to the market itself (although certain of these strategies may have minor discretionary elements incorporated into their
systematic strategy). The widespread use of technical trading systems frequently results in numerous trading advisors attempting
to execute similar trades at or about the same time, altering trading patterns and affecting market liquidity. Furthermore, the
profit potential of trend-following systems may be diminished by the changing character of the markets, which may make historical
price data (on which technical programs are based) only marginally relevant to future market patterns. Systematic strategies are
developed on the basis of a statistical analysis of market prices. Consequently, any factor external to the market itself that
dominates prices that a discretionary decision maker may take into account may cause major losses for a systematic strategy. For
example, a pending political or economic event may be very likely to cause a major price movement, but a systematic strategy may
continue to maintain positions indicated by its trading method that might incur major losses if the event proved to be adverse.

           Table of Contents            

However,
because certain of the Trading Advisors  strategies involve some discretionary aspects in addition to their technical factors,
certain of the Trading Advisors may occasionally use discretion in investing the assets of a Trading Company. For example, the
Trading Advisors often use discretion in selecting contracts and markets to be followed. In exercising such discretion, such Trading
Advisor may take positions opposite to those recommended by the Trading Advisor s trading system or signals. Discretionary
decision making may also result in a Trading Advisor failing to capitalize on certain price trends or making unprofitable trades
in a situation where another trader relying solely on a systematic approach might not have done so. Furthermore, such use of discretion
may not enable the relevant Series of the Trust to avoid losses, and in fact, such use of discretion may cause such Series to
forego profits which it may have otherwise earned had such discretion not been used.  

Cyber
Risks and Security   

The
Trust s business requires it to use and store investor, employee and business partner personally identifiable information
( PII ). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences,
tax identification numbers and payment account information.  

The
Trust requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Trust also uses encryption
and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Trust data or accounts.
These security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management,
or other irregularities. To help protect investors and the Trust, the Trust monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity
and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances.  

The
Trust devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and
data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Trust was to experience a breach of its
systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and investor relationships.
Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Trust s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Trust s
reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the Trust could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.
While the Trust maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured
retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses
or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.  

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure    

The
means by which the Managing Owner attempts to manage the risk of the Trust s open positions is essentially the same in all
market categories traded. The Managing Owner applies risk management policies to trading which generally are designed to limit
the total exposure of assets under management. In addition, the Managing Owner follows diversification guidelines which are often
formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups.

                                         AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the management of the Managing Owner, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer, the Trust evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )),
for the Trust and each Series as of September 30, 2016 (the  Evaluation Date ). Any control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be met. Furthermore,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Managing Owner concluded that,
as of the Evaluation Date, the disclosure controls and procedures for the Trust and each Series were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that they are timely alerted to the material information relating to the Trust and each Series required to be included
in the Trust s periodic SEC filing.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     

There
were changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting
as a result of the transition to accessing investment via Galaxy Plus and financial reporting transition to Gemini Hedge Fund
Administration.  

Scope
of Exhibit 31 Certifications     

The certification of the Chief Executive Officer and the
Principal Financial Officer of the Managing Owner included as Exhibit 31.1 to this Form 10-Q applies not only to the Trust as a
whole but also to each Series individually.

                                         to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
                                         the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
                                         within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;    

(b)    Designed
                                         such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over
                                         financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance

                                         for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

(c)    Evaluated
                                         the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented

                                         procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
                                         and    

(d)    Disclosed
                                         in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and    

5.    The
                                         registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most
                                         recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s
                                         auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons
                                         performing the equivalent functions):    

(a)    All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and    

(b)    Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
