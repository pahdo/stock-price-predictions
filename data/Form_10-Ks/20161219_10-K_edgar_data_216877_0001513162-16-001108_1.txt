       FORM 10-K         PART I         ITEM 1.       BUSINESS         a.   BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT     Pismo Coast Village, Inc., the "Registrant" or the "Company," was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on April 2, 1975. The Company's sole business is owning and operating Pismo Coast Village RV Resort, a recreational vehicle resort (hereinafter the "Resort") in Pismo Beach, California. The Resort has continued to enhance its business by upgrading facilities and services to better serve customers.         b.   BUSINESS OF ISSUER     The Company is engaged in only one business, namely, the ownership and operation of the Resort. The Company generates revenue from rental of camping sites, recreational vehicle storage, recreational vehicle repair and retail sales from a general store and recreational vehicle parts store. Accordingly, all of the revenues, operating profit (loss) and identifiable assets of the Company are attributable to a single industry segment.         Pismo Coast Village RV Resort is a full-service 400-space recreational vehicle resort. Its resort operations include site rentals, RV storage business, video arcade, laundromat, and other income sources related to the operation. The retail operations include a general store, RV parts store, and RV repair shop. In addition, the Company has a recreation department that provides a youth program and recreational equipment rentals.         PUBLIC AND SHAREHOLDER USERS     The present policy of the Company is to offer each shareholder the opportunity for 45 nights of free use of sites at the Resort, 25 nights may be used during prime time and 20 nights during non-prime time. The free use of sites by shareholders is managed by designating the nights of the year as prime time and non-prime time. A prime time night is one that is most in demand, for example, Memorial Day Weekend and the period from June 1 until Labor Day. Non-prime time is that time with the least demand. Each shareholder is furnished annually a calendar that designates the prime and non-prime time nights; it also provides a schedule of when reservations can be made and the procedure for making reservations. Shareholder's free use of sites average approximately 21% to 24% annually (refer to Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, page 9).         SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS     The business of the Company is seasonal and is concentrated during prime days of the year which are defined as follows: President's Day Weekend, Easter week, Memorial Day Weekend, summer vacation months, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Weekend and Christmas vacation.         WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS     By accumulating reserves during the prime seasons, the Company is able generally to meet its working capital needs during off-season. Industry practice is to accumulate funds during the prime season, and use such funds, as necessary, in the off-season. The Company has arranged, but not used, a $500,000 line of credit to ensure funds are available, if necessary, in the off-season.         3        
       COMPETITION     The Company is in competition with nine other RV parks located within a five-mile radius. Since its property is the only property located adjacent to the beach, it has a competitive edge. The Company is recognized as a recreational vehicle resort rather than a park because of its upgraded facilities and amenities, which include 54 Channels of Satellite TV, high-speed wireless Internet service throughout the property, a heated pool, a miniature golf course and a recreational program. The Resort is noted for its ability to provide full service, which includes RV storage and RV repair and service. The Resort is consistently given high ratings by industry travel guides based on resort appearance, facilities offered, and recreational programs. In November 2007, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort was awarded the designation of 2007/2008 RV Park of the Year, Large Park Category, by the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (ARVC), which has a membership of more than 3,900 properties. Pismo Coast Village RV Resort also received national Park of the Year honors in 1999, 1997, and 1995. In fiscal year 2004, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort was awarded the designation of RV Park of the Year - Mega Park Category 2004 by the California Travel Parks Association (CTPA), now known as the California Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (CalARVC). These factors allow the Resort to price its site rental fees above most of its competition based on perceived value received.         Competition for the tourist market is strong between the cities on the Central Coast of California. Resort management and staff are involved with the City of Pismo Beach, Chamber of Commerce, Conference and Visitors Bureau, and are major sponsors in cooperative events and advertising. The Resort continues to market off-season discounts and place advertisements in trade publications and industry directories. In addition, the Company places its brochure with companies selling or renting recreational vehicles and has found the Resort's Internet web page and social media to be very effective. The marketing program also targets groups and clubs by offering group discounts, meeting facilities, and catering services. The Company's marketing plan was funded by $46,998 for fiscal year 2016, which was developed out of operating revenues. The major source of the Company's business is repeat business, which has been developed by attention to good customer service and providing quality recreational facilities.         ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION     The Company is affected by federal, state and local antipollution laws and regulations. Due to the nature of its business operations (camping, RV storage and small retail store sales), the discharge of materials into the environment is not considered to be of a significant concern, and the EPA has not designated the Company as a potentially responsible party for clean up of hazardous waste.         The main property of the Resort is located within the boundaries of those lands under the review and purview of the Coastal Commission of the State of California and the City of Pismo Beach. The water and sewer systems are serviced by the City of Pismo Beach. The Company was subject to state and federal regulations regarding the fiscal year 1996 reconstruction of an outflow structure that empties into Pismo Creek at the north boundary of the Resort. Because the Resort is within the wetlands area, the California Coastal Commission required permits for repair and construction to be reviewed by the following agencies: City of Pismo Beach, State Lands Commission, Regional Water Quality Board, State of California, California Department of Fish and Game, State Department of Parks and Recreation and the Army Corps of Engineers.         EMPLOYEES     As of September 30, 2016, the Company employed approximately 64 people with 29 of these on a part-time basis and 35 on a full-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, additional staff is needed during peak periods and fewer during the off-season. Staffing levels during the fiscal year ranged from approximately 55 employees to 67 employees. Management considers its labor relations to be good.         4        
       ADDITIONAL INFORMATION     The Company has remained conservative when considering rates and rate increases. As a result of experiencing increasing operational expenses and conducting a local comparative rate study, the Board of Directors (Board)  voted to increase the base rate for RV storage $5 per month effective January 1, 2015. The Board also voted at the May 2016 meeting to increase all nightly rates $3 per night effective January 1, 2017. It is anticipated the proposed rates will continue to market site usage at its highest value and not negatively impact the Company's ability to capture an optimum market share.         c.   REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS     Pismo Coast Village, Inc. files quarterly reports, an annual report, and periodic reports, providing the public with current information about the Company and its operations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.         The Company makes available on its website, www.pismocoastvillage.com, access to its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.         The public may read and copy any materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on official business days during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., at the SEC's Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N. E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy statements, and other information that the Company files electronically with the SEC.         ITEM 2.       PROPERTIES         The Company's principal asset consists of the Resort, which is located at 165 South Dolliver Street in Pismo Beach, California. The Resort is built on a 26-acre site and includes 400 campsites with full hookups and nearby restrooms with showers and common facilities, such as a video arcade, recreation hall, general store, swimming pool, laundromat, and three playgrounds.         In 1980, the Company purchased a 2.1-acre parcel of real property located at 2250 22nd Street, Oceano, California, at a price of $66,564. The property is being used by the Company as a storage facility for recreational vehicles. On October 20, 2014, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term. The storage capacity of this lot is approximately 121 units.         In 1981, the Company exercised an option and purchased a 3.3-acre parcel located at 300 South Dolliver Street, Pismo Beach, California, at a price of $300,000. The property, which previously had been leased by the Company, is used primarily as a recreational vehicle storage yard. The storage capacity of this lot is approximately 120 units.         In 1988, the Company purchased approximately 0.6 acres of property at 180 South Dolliver Street, Pismo Beach, California, across the street from the main property, consisting of a large building with a storefront and one large maintenance bay in the rear. Also, on the property is a smaller garage-type building with three parking stalls. The Company enlarged its recreational vehicle repair operation, added RV storage for approximately eleven units and developed the storefront into a RV parts store. The property was purchased for $345,000, of which $300,000 was financed and paid in full during fiscal year 1997.         5        
       On December 31, 1998, the Company closed escrow on a parcel of property located at 1295 Sand Dollar Avenue, Oceano, California, to be developed as an additional RV storage facility. The 5.5-acre property is located adjacent to existing Company RV storage. On October 14, 1999, construction was completed and the Company received County approval to occupy the premises. The property was purchased for $495,000, of which $395,000 was financed and paid in full in July 2000. Development cost amounted to $195,723 and was allocated from operational cash flow. Storage capacity for this property is approximately 408 units and is currently full. The property is in good condition and being held as collateral for the note on the properties purchased in 2006.         On February 28, 2003, the Company closed escrow on a parcel of property to be developed as an additional RV storage facility. The 4.7-acre property is located on Fountain Avenue in Oceano, California, and was purchased for $650,000, of which $500,000 was financed. The note on this property was paid off in September 2005. The construction permit granted by the County of San Luis Obispo was contingent upon permit approval by the California Coastal Commission. In January 2006, the Commission denied the permit based on wetland conditions. The property is currently being considered for another use.         Due to the continued demand for RV storage and the denial of the aforementioned permit, the Board of Directors elected to purchase additional property. On January 11, 2006, the Company closed escrow on a six-acre property located at 974 Sheridan Road, Arroyo Grande, California, previously developed as an RV storage facility. The purchase price was $2.1 million, and included approximately 80 existing storage customers. This property had been permitted and developed the previous year, and is considered in good condition with a capacity of approximately 229 units.         On April 6, 2006, the Company purchased the 2.2-acre property located at 2030 Front Street in Oceano, California, that it previously rented from Union Pacific Railroad for RV storage. The purchase price was $925,000 and the condition is considered good. The lot is operating at full capacity with 181 units.         On May 9, 2008, the Company closed escrow on a 19.55-acre property located at 2180 Arriba Place in Arroyo Grande, California, to be developed for RV storage. The purchase price was $3.1 million for the undeveloped land. The Company received a development permit through the County of San Luis Obispo Planning Commission. The development was completed in May 2010, and the storage capacity is expected to be approximately 900 units.         On May 20, 2015, the Company closed escrow on a one-acre property located at 2096 Nipomo Street in Oceano, California, to be developed as an RV Repair and Service facility. The purchase price was $425,000 and required the demolition of a two-story residence. The Company successfully expanded the usable property area by seeking road abandonment. Currently the project is in the permit process with San Luis Obispo County.          There is no deferred maintenance on any of the Resort's facilities. The Company's facilities are in good condition and adequate to meet the needs of the shareholder users as well as the public users. The Company continues to develop sufficient revenue from general public sites sales to support a continued positive maintenance program and to meet the demands of shareholders use of free sites.         Management considers the Company's insurance policies offer adequate coverage for risk and liability exposure.         1.   TRAILER STORAGE YARDS     In 1986, the Company leased a parcel of land 100 feet wide by 960 feet long, located at 2030 Front Street in Oceano, California, from the Union Pacific Railroad Corporation. The property is being used by the Company as a storage facility for recreational vehicles. Capital improvements in the amount of $40,000 were made to this property, which provides storage for approximately 180 units. On July 29, 2005, Union Pacific Railroad Corporation sold the property to the Weyrick Family Trust, who, after entering into a five-year lease, agreed to sell the property to the Company for $925,000. This transaction was completed April 6, 2006.         6        
       Associated with the previously mentioned property, and included within the fenced storage perimeter, is the lease of a ten-foot by 960-foot section belonging to Union Pacific Railroad. This lease also allows for the Company's fence to encroach upon the lessor's property. This annual lease is currently $6,365, with a 3% automatic annual increase.         In 1991, the Company developed a lease for a five-acre RV storage lot at the Oceano Airport clear zone as storage for approximately 310 RVs. This lot, which is located at 1909 Delta Lane in Oceano, was developed to replace a 100-unit storage lot that was closed when the lease was not renewed. Construction was completed in January 1992 and capital improvements in the amount of $330,768 were made to this property of which $300,000 was financed and paid in full during fiscal year 1997. The original lease on the storage lot was for five years and the Company has executed a third five-year option with the County of San Luis Obispo that expired December 31, 2006. In response to the Company's request for another five-year extension, the County has answered that, until the Oceano Airport Master Plan is updated, the lease will be a month-to-month holdover.         Lease payments for the first year of control and occupancy area were $1,500 per month, $2,000 per month for the second year, and continuing years are tied to the "CPI" index. During fiscal year 2016, lease payments were made in the amount of $36,701. Current rent payments are $3,095 and may be impacted in the future by the flood district assessment.         The Resort leases out areas to other companies to insure that the best service and equipment are available for guest use or creates cash flow for the Company. These areas are leased from the Company pursuant to the herein below described leases.         1.   RECREATIONAL ARCADE AGREEMENT WITH COIN AMUSEMENTS, INC.     This agreement is dated November 1, 2016, and pursuant to this agreement, the Company granted Coin Amusements, Inc. the concession to operate various coin-operated game units at the Resort. The one-year term expires on October 31, 2017, and continued renewal is expected without significant impact.         2.   WASH MULTIFAMILY LAUNDRY SYSTEMS, GOLETA, CA     The seven-year lease that expired October 31, 2016, was renewed for another seven years effective September 1, 2016. The lease grants Wash Multifamily Laundry Systems ( Wash ) the right to place and service coin-operated laundry machines on the Resort. The agreement provides that 70% of the Lessee's gross income be paid to the Company as rent. On September 8, 2016, Wash replaced all 18 washers and 18 dryers with new equipment. Continued renewal is expected without significant impact.          3.   PISMO COAST INVESTMENTS     The Company renewed a lease agreement with Ms. Jeanne Sousa, a California Corporations Licensed Broker, for the lease of a 200-square foot building at the Resort from which she conducts sales activities in the Company's stock. The term of the lease is for three years commencing on January 1, 2014, and ending on December 31, 2016. Continued renewal is expected without significant impact. Termination or cancellation may be made by either Lessor or Lessee by giving the other party sixty (60) days written notice.          4.   VERIZON WIRELESS      The Company entered into a lease with GTE Mobilnet of Santa Barbara Limited Partnership, d/b/a Verizon Wireless, for a 42-foot by 37-foot portion of the RV storage lot located at 2180 Arriba Place, Arroyo Grande, California, for the construction and operation of a cell tower communications facility. The term of the lease is for five years commencing on January 21, 2013, and ending on January 20, 2018. Continued renewal is expected without significant impact. The Lessee, upon the annual anniversary date of the agreement, may terminate provided that three (3) months prior notice is given to Lessor.          7        
       On October 20, 2014, the Company entered into a second lease with GTE Mobilnet of Santa Barbara Limited Partnership, d/b/a Verizon Wireless, for a 40-foot by 40-foot portion of the RV storage lot located at 2250 22 nd  Street, Oceano, California, for the construction and operation of a cell tower communications facility.

ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         The following analysis discusses the Company's financial condition as of September 30, 2016, compared with September 30, 2015. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the  audited financial statement and the related notes to the financial statement and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.         Certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward-looking statements, such as statements relating to anticipated expenses, capital spending and financing sources. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made herein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to competitive industry conditions, California tourism and weather conditions, dependence on existing management, leverage and debt service, the regulation of the recreational vehicle industry, domestic or global economic conditions and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws.         OVERVIEW     Pismo Coast Village, Inc. operates as a 400-space recreational vehicle resort. The Company includes additional business operations to provide its users with a full range of services expected of a recreational resort. These services include a store, video arcade, laundromat, recreational vehicle repair, RV parts shop and an RV storage operation.         The Company is authorized to issue 1,800 shares, of one class, all with equal voting rights and all being without par value. Transfers of shares are restricted by Company bylaws. One such restriction is that transferees must acquire shares with intent to hold the same for the purpose of enjoying camping rights and other benefits to which a shareholder is entitled. Each share of stock is intended to provide the shareholder with the opportunity for 45 nights of free site use per year. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient funds from the public, the Company may be required to charge shareholders for services.         Management is charged with the task of developing sufficient funds to operate the Resort through site sales to general public guests by allocating a minimum of 175 sites to general public use and allocating a maximum of 225 sites for shareholder free use. The other service centers are expected to generate sufficient revenue to support themselves and/or produce a profit.         The Company continues to promote and depend upon recreational vehicle camping as the primary source of revenue. The rental of campsites to the general public provides income to cover expenses, complete capital improvements, and allow shareholders up to45 free nights camping annually. Additional revenues come from RV storage and spotting, RV service and repair, on-site convenience store, and other ancillary activities such as laundromat, arcade, and bike rental.         9        
           The RVing public actively seeks accommodations on the Central Coast despite volatile fuel prices and personal financial uncertainties. RVing offers an affordable outdoor recreational experience, and the Company provides quality facilities and services in a highly popular location. Site occupancy for fiscal year 2016 was up 0.71% following last year s record occupancy, due to good weather and the improving economy. Revenues from ancillary operations, such as the General Store, RV service, laundromat, arcade, and bike rental, all contribute to the profitability of the Company.          RV storage continues to provide a significant portion of the Company s revenue. RV storage provides numerous benefits to the customer including: no stress of towing, no need to own a tow vehicle, use of RV by multiple family members, and convenience.         After years with no debt, the Board of Directors approved expansion of the RV storage program and understood this investment would require substantial financing. Management has made it a high priority to affect timely construction and successful marketing in order to maximize return on this investment.         Ongoing investment in resort improvements has assured resort guests and shareholders a top quality, up-to-date facility. This quality and pride of ownership was evident when the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds Park of the Year was awarded to the resort for 2007 - 2008. In addition, in 2008 the resort was the only industry rated "A" park in California for customer satisfaction based on Internet visitor surveys collected nationally by Guest Reviews. The resort also received the Guest Reviews  A  rated park recognition for the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and one of 34 parks nationally in 2015.          The Company's commitment to quality, value, and enjoyment is underscored by the business's success due to word of mouth and referrals from guests. In addition, investment for online marketing, ads in the leading national directories, and trade magazine advertising formulates most of the business-marketing plan.         CURRENT OPERATING PLANS     The Board of Directors continues its previously established policy by adopting a stringent conservative budget for fiscal year 2017, which projects a positive cash flow of approximately $1,700,355 from operations. This projection is based on paid site occupancy reflecting similar occupancy as experienced in fiscal year 2016. The 2017 budget plan also includes a $3 per night site rental rate increase for all nightly rates effective January 1, 2017. While the Company projects a positive cash flow, this cannot be assured for fiscal year 2017.         FINANCIAL CONDITION     The business of the Company is seasonal and is concentrated on prime days of the year which are defined as follows: President's Day Weekend, Easter week, Memorial Day Weekend, summer vacation months, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Weekend, and Christmas vacation. There are no known trends that affect business or affect revenue.         The Company develops its income from two sources: (a) Resort Operations, consisting of revenues generated from RV site rentals, from RV storage space operations, and from lease revenues from laundromat, arcade, restaurant operations and property leases for cell tower communications facilities by third party lessees; and (b) Retail Operations, consisting of revenues from general store operations and from RV parts and service operations.         The Company has arranged a $500,000 line of credit that is currently not drawn on. Besides the financing resulting from the purchase of RV storage property, the Company has no other liabilities to creditors other than current accounts payable arising from its normal day-to-day operations and advance Resort rental reservation deposits, none of which are in arrears.         10        
           LIQUIDITY     The Company's policy is to use its ability to generate operating cash flow to meet its expected future needs for internal growth. The Company has continued to maintain sufficient cash so as to not require the use of a short-term line of credit during the off-season period, and the Company expects to be able to do so (although no assurance of continued cash flow can be given).         Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,287,902 in  2016, consistent with the 2015 fiscal year.          During fiscal year 2016, capital investment of $288,045 was made that included road paving, a new trailer tow truck, a new forklift, ice cream freezer, Wi-Fi equipment, golf cart, and engineering and permits for the new RV service facility. During fiscal year 2015, capital investment of $688,066 was made that included replacement of the fence along the front of the resort, road paving, security system for RV storage lots, General Store walk-in cooler upgrade and new ice-making machine, and computer equipment. These projects were completed on time and within budget. As of September 30, 2016, the Company carried a debt of $1,431,890 as a result of acquiring the three RV storage properties.         With the possibility of requiring additional funds for planned capital improvements and the winter season, the Company maintains a $500,000 Line of Credit to insure funds will be available if required. In anticipation of future large projects, the Board of Directors has instructed management to build operational cash balances.         Fiscal year 2016's current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 1.53 increased from fiscal year 2015's current ratio of 1.34. The increase in current ratio is the result of increased prepaid income taxes and cash and cash equivalents.         Working Capital increased to $1,089,514 at the end of fiscal year 2016, compared with $654,282 at the end of fiscal year 2015. This increase is primarily a result of cash and cash equivalents reflecting increased business revenues and prepaid income taxes.          CAPITAL RESOURCES AND PLANNED EXPENDITURES     The Company plans capital expenditures up to $873,000 in fiscal year 2017 to further enhance the Resort facilities and services. This would include construction of a new RV service and repair facility, RV storage lot security, replacement vehicles for security, maintenance, and RV service, and repairs to the Overlook structure. Funding for these projects is expected to be from normal operating cash flows and, if necessary, supplemented with outside financing. These capital expenditures are expected to increase the Resort's value to its shareholders and the general public.         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON     Revenue: Operating revenue, interest and other income increased above the prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, by $334,159, or 4.4%.         11        
            
       Occupancy rates on the previous table are calculated based on the quantity occupied as compared to the total sites available for occupancy (i.e., total occupied to number of total available). Average paid site is based on site revenue and paid sites. Resort support operations include revenues received from the arcade, laundromat, recreational activities, and other less significant sources.          2016 COMPARED WITH 2015     Resort operations income increased $284,633, or 4.5%, primarily due to an $180,376, or 4.0%, increase in site rental revenue. This increase reflects a 1.0% increase in paid site occupancy and rate increases effective January 1, 2016. RV storage and spotting activity increased $72,747, or 4.5%, above the previous year.          Retail operations income increased $49,114, or 3.7%, due to an $88,394, or 15.8%, increase in the RV Service Department. The RV Service Department growth was in part due to operating with full staffing and some large repair jobs. In an effort to maximize revenue, management continues to stock more appropriate items, more effectively merchandise, and pay greater attention to customer service. In addition, management has actively promoted the RV service and retail operation locally compared to previous years.         Interest/Dividend Income increased $412, or 11.4%, above the previous year. Loss on Disposal of Assets remained constant at $1,551. In addition, Interest Expense decreased $28,966, or 22.6%, due to accelerating the payments and interest adjustments on financing the RV storage properties.         12        
       Operating Expenses increased $391,782, or 8.07%, as a result of labor, employee benefits, workers  compensation, tree trimming, property tax, RV storage lot security, Wi-Fi, telephone, and garbage.         Maintaining a conservative approach, most expense items were managed well below plan and in many categories below the previous year. The Board of Directors has directed management to continue maintenance projects as needed to provide a first class resort for campers using recreational vehicles.         Income before provision for income taxes of $1,652,389, a 3.2% decrease below last year, is reflective of increased operating expenses and depreciation.         Net income of $928,889 for fiscal year 2016 shows a decrease of $32,433, or 3.4%, below a net income of $961,322 in 2015. This decrease in net income is a reflection of increased resort operating expenses and depreciation.         INFLATION has not had a significant impact on our profit position. The Company has increased rates, which have more than compensated for the rate of inflation.         FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS could be unfavorably impacted to the extent that changing prices result in lower discretionary income for customers and/or increased transportation costs to the Resort. In addition, increasing prices affect operations and liquidity by raising the replacement cost of property and equipment.         FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS:     A number of factors, many of which are common to the lodging industry and beyond our control, could affect our business, including the following:                            increased gas prices;                            increased competition from other resorts in our market;                            increases in operating costs due to inflation, labor costs, workers' compensation and healthcare related costs, utility costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences and other factors that may not be offset by increased rates;                             changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;                            changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;                            adverse effects of market conditions, which may diminish the desire for leisure travel; and                            adverse effects of a downturn in the leisure industry.         The leisure and travel business is seasonal and seasonal variations in revenue at our resort can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue.         Our revenue is generally highest in the third and fourth quarters. Quarterly revenue also may be harmed by events beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, terrorist attacks or alerts, contagious diseases, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, we have to rely on our short-term line of credit for operations.         In the recent past, events beyond our control, including an economic slowdown and terrorism, harmed the operating performance of the leisure industry generally, and if these or similar events occur again, our operating and financial results may be harmed by declines in average daily rates or occupancy.         13        
       Carrying our outstanding debt may harm our business and financial results by:                             requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to make required payments on principal and interest, which will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;                            making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;                             limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations, capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions in the future; and                            requiring us to sell one or more properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, in order to make required payments of interest and principal.         Our resort has a need for ongoing renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in connection with improvements, and the costs of such renovations or improvements may exceed our expectations.         Occupancy and the rates we are able to charge are often affected by the maintenance and capital improvements at a resort, especially in the event that the maintenance of improvements are not completed on schedule, or if the improvements result in the closure of the General Store or a significant number of sites. The costs of capital expenditures we need to make could harm our financial condition and reduce amounts available for operations. These capital improvements may also give rise to additional risks including:                            construction cost overruns and delays;                            a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing of these expenditures may not be available to us on favorable terms;                            uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun;                             disruption in service and site availability causing reduced demand, occupancy, and rates; and                            possible environmental issues.         We rely on our executive officers, the loss of whom could significantly harm our business.         Our continued success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our C.E.O. and General Manager, Jay Jamison. Mr. Jamison is important to our business and strategy and to the extent that were he to depart and is not replaced with an experienced substitute, Mr. Jamison's departure could harm our operations, financial condition and operating results.         Uninsured and underinsured losses could harm our financial condition, and results of operations.         Various types of catastrophic issues, such as losses due to wars, terrorist acts, earthquakes, floods, pollution or environmental matters, generally are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be subject to insurance coverage limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Our resort is located on the coast of California, which has been historically at greater risk to certain acts of nature (such as severe storms, fires and earthquakes).         14        
           In the event of a catastrophic loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost properties. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the resort, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the resort. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any notes payable or other financial obligations related to the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate the resort after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property.         ITEM 8.       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA         Pismo Coast Village, Inc. is responsible for the information and representations contained in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements.         Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure provide for appropriate segregation of duties.         15        
             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED           PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM              To the Board of Directors and     Shareholders of Pismo Coast Village, Inc.     Pismo Beach, California         We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Pismo Coast Village, Inc. (the Company) (a California corporation) as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.          We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.          In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

         PISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015                NOTE 1     Nature of Business          Pismo Coast Village, Inc.   (Company) is a recreational vehicle camping resort. Its business is seasonal in nature with the fourth quarter, the summer, being its busiest and most profitable.          NOTE 2     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies         Revenue and Cost Recognition        The Company's revenue is recognized on the accrual basis as earned based on the date of stay. Expenditures are recorded on the accrual basis whereby expenses are recorded when incurred, rather than when paid.          Cash and Cash Equivalents          For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments, including certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents.          Inventories          Inventories have been valued at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories are comprised primarily of goods in the general store and parts in the RV repair shop.         Property and Equipment   Pismo Coast Village        All property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using straight-line method on cost of the assets, less allowance for salvage value, where appropriate. Depreciation rates are based upon the following estimated useful lives:                 Building and park improvements        5 to 40 years           Furniture, fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements        3 to 31.5 years           Transportation equipment        5 to 10 years     
       Assets acquired under capital leases total $78,651 and $23,630, net of accumulated depreciation as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Earnings Per Share        The earnings per share are based on the 1,775 and 1,783 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The financial statements report only basic earnings per share, as there are no potentially dilutive shares outstanding.          Use of Estimates          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.         20        
         PISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015         PAGE 2                 NOTE 2     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)          Advertising        The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of non-direct response advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising expense was $46,999 and $50,216 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.          Concentration of Credit Risk          At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash deposits in excess of the $250,000 federally insured limit with Heritage Oaks Bank of $725,895; however, in the past the Company has used an Excess Deposit Insurance Bond, which secures deposits up to $1,500,000. It has recently been stated by bank regulators that this insurance bond is not enforceable. Heritage Oaks Bank is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS). Large deposits are divided into smaller amounts and placed with other FDIC insured banks which are also members of the CDARS network. Then, those member banks issue CDs in amounts under $250,000, so that the entire investment is eligible for FDIC insurance.           Subsequent Events           Events subsequent to September 30, 2016, have been evaluated through November 18, 2016, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

As of September 30, 2016, management has considered its tax positions and believes that the Company did not maintain any tax positions that did not meet the  more likely than not  threshold and, accordingly, all tax positions have been fully recorded in the provision for income taxes. It is the policy of the Company to consistently classify interest and penalties associated with income tax expense separately from the provision for income taxes. No interest or penalties associated with income taxes have been included in this calculation, or separately in the Statements of Income and Retained Earnings, and no significant increases or decreases are expected within the following twelve-month period.          Although the Company does not maintain any uncertain tax positions, tax returns generally remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2013, and by the California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2012.

       ITEM 9.       CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE     There has been no change of accountants nor any disagreement with accountants on any matter of accounting principle or practices or financial statement disclosure required to be reported under this item.         ITEM 9A(T).             CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.         Our management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period covered by this report). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.         INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     Our management is also responsible for establishing internal control over financial reporting ("ICFR") as defined in Rules 13a-I5(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the 1934 Act. Our ICFR are intended to be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our ICFR are expected to include those policies and procedures that management believes are necessary that:         1.            pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;         2             provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and         3.            provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial  statements.         Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect of financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.         29        
       As of September 30, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) based on the criteria for effective ICFR established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments by smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated filers. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.         This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.         There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

           b.       OTHER OFFICERS AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES                JAY JAMISON, Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and  Assistant Corporate Secretary         Age 63           Jay Jamison has been employed by the Company since June 1997 as General Manager and serves as Assistant Corporate Secretary. In March 2007, the Board changed his title to Chief Executive Officer/General Manager. He has a B.S. degree in Agricultural Management from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, graduating in 1976. Mr. Jamison was raised on his family s guest ranch, Rancho Oso, in Santa Barbara County, which included a recreational vehicle park, resident summer camp, equestrian facilities and numerous resort amenities. He worked on the ranch throughout his childhood and after college. The family business was sold in 1983, at which time Mr. Jamison was hired by Thousand Trails, Inc., a private membership resort, as a Resort Operations Manager. His last ten years at Thousand Trails were spent managing a 200-acre, 518-site, full-service resort near Hollister, California. He also managed Thousand Trails resorts in Acton and Idyllwild in Southern California. Prior to his employment with the Company, Mr. Jamison was a General Manager with Skycrest Enterprises in Redding and managed Sugarloaf Marina and Resort on Lake Shasta in Northern California between January 1995 and June 1997. Mr. Jamison was appointed to and served as a commissioner on the Pismo Beach Conference and Visitors Bureaufrom February 1998 to January 2010, serving as Chair from August 1999 until February 2009. At the 1999 National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds Annual Convention, he was elected to serve on the Board of Directors representing the ten western states. During his two three-year terms on the Board, he served four years as Treasurer of the National Association, a position he held until he termed out December 2005. In June of 2002, Mr. Jamison was installed as a Director on the Board for the San Luis Obispo County Chapter of the American Red Cross, and served until June 2011, including from June 2006 until July 2008 as Board Chairman.

During his two four-year terms, he served on the Audit Committee, two years as committee chairman, and one year on the Executive Committee. He termed out as a commissioner in June 2014; however, he still remains a member of the Audit Committee.

Since 2014 Mr. Jamison has served as a member of the Advisory Council for the Recreation, Parks, and Tourism Administration (RPTA) Department at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.         c.       FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS     There are no familial relationships between the Directors nor between the Directors and the Officers.         d.       INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     To the knowledge of the Company, none of the officers or directors have been personally involved in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the directors or officers have been convicted in any criminal proceedings (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or are the subject of a criminal proceeding which is presently pending, nor have such persons been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining them from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or insurance company, or from engaging in or continuing in any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, nor were any of such persons the subject of a federal or state authority barring or suspending, for more than 60 days, the right of such person to be engaged in any such activity, which order has not been reversed or suspended.         e.       AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT     Our Board of Directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B, and is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.         35        
   
           We believe that the members of our Audit Committee are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Due to the fact that the directors of Pismo Coast Village, Inc. do not receive compensation for the services they provide in that capacity, the Company has been unable to nominate and retain a director with the required expertise to stand for election to the Board of Directors. However, until the time that our Audit Committee has a qualified audit committee financial expert, we believe our engagement of Glenn Burdette (GB), Certified Public Accountants, satisfies this requirement. GB provides the Company's quarterly compilation of the balance sheets and the related statements of operations, and retained earnings, and cash flows in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.         f.       CODE OF ETHICS     On November 8, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the introduction to our code of ethical conduct. After further review, consideration was given to adopting a more comprehensive and detailed Code. At the meeting of the Executive Committee held June 19, 2009, the committee approved a recommendation to present a revised Code of Ethics to the full Board for adoption. At the Board of Directors  meeting held July 18, 2009, the Board unanimously approved the revised and complete Code of Ethics that applies to all the Company's employees and directors, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions.         The complete text of the revised Code of Ethics is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 14. In addition, the Company has posted the Code of Ethics on its website, www.pismocoastvillage.com  .          A copy of the Company s Code of Ethics will be provided to any person, without charge, upon written request. Requests for the Company s Code of Ethics should be addressed to:         Mr. Jay Jamison, Chief Executive Officer/General Manager     Pismo Coast Village, Inc.     165 South Dolliver Street     Pismo Beach CA 93449         g.       SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company s directors, officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities within specified time periods to file with the SEC initial reports ( Form 3 ) of beneficial ownership and reports of changes ( Form 4  and  Form 5 ) in beneficial ownership of Common Stock of the Company. To the Company s knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, all of the Company s officers, directors and beneficial owners of greater than ten percent of the outstanding Common Stock complied with the Section 16(a) filing requirements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016.          ITEM 11.       EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION      STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED DURING THE LAST FISCAL YEAR          This information required by Item 11 is incorporated by reference in the Company s Definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held January 21, 2017, under the caption  Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers.  The Definitive Proxy Statement is expected to be filed with the Commission on or before December 21, 2016.         36        
   
           ITEM 12.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT         a.

CHANGES IN CONTROL     Not applicable.         38        
   
       ITEM 13.       CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR                         INDEPENDENCE     There have been no transactions during the past two years, or proposed transactions, to which the Company was or is to be a party, in which any of the officers, directors, nominees, named shareholders, or family members of any such persons, had or is to have a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions where competitive bids determine the rates or charges involved, or where the amount involved does not exceed $120,000, or where the interest of the party arises solely from the ownership of securities of the Company and the party received no extra or special benefit that was not shared by all shareholders.         EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS     See Item 10, Executive Compensation - Employment contracts and termination of employment and change in control arrangements, for a discussion of the current employment contracts between Pismo Coast Village, Inc. and Mr. Jamison.         OTHER ARRANGEMENTS     During the fiscal years 2016 and 2015, Pismo Coast Village, Inc. paid for various hospitality functions and for travel, lodging and hospitality expenses for spouses who occasionally accompanied directors when they were traveling on company business. Management believes that the expenditures were to Pismo Coast Village, Inc.'s benefit.         CERTAIN BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS     None.         (1)-(5)       INDEBTEDNESS OF MANAGEMENT     None.         TRANSACTIONS WITH PROMOTERS     Not applicable.         DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE     Our Board of Directors consists of shareholders of the Resort and therefore are not considered to be "independent" as defined by Section 121A of the American Stock Exchange Listing Standards. The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in its determination of independence of all members of the Board (including any relationships set forth in this Form 10-K under the heading "Certain Related Person Transactions"). As disclosed above, the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Personnel and Compensation/Benefits Committee members are not considered to be independent.         ITEM 14.       PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES         The shareholders will vote on the independent audit firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017 at the annual shareholders  meeting held on January 21, 2017.         The following table discloses the fees that the Company was billed for professional services rendered by its independent public accounting firm, Brown Armstrong Accountancy Corporation, in each of the last two fiscal years.         39        

(1)     Reflects fees billed for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its Form 10-K and review of its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.        (2)     Reflects fees, if any, for consulting services related to financial accounting and reporting matters.        (3)      Reflects fees billed for tax compliance, tax advice and preparation of the Company's federal tax return.         (4)      Reflects fees, if any, for other products or professional services not related to the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and review of its quarterly reports, or for tax services.         (5)       AUDIT COMMITTEE'S PREAPPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES    For the fiscal years ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, all audit related services, tax services and other services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by Brown Armstrong were compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing function.         (6)      No effort expended on the principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most recent fiscal year was attributed to work performed by persons other than the accountant's full-time, permanent employees.          40

 EXHIBIT 14

Exhibit 14         Exhibit 99.Code of Ethics             PISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC.       (the "Company")               CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT       FOR DIRECTORS, SENIOR OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY       (the "Code")                   INTRODUCTION         This Code applies to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Controller and persons performing similar functions (collectively, the "Senior Officers") along with all directors and employees within the Company (the Senior Officers, directors and employees are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Employees"). This Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide all Employees of the Company. All Employees should conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid the appearance of improper behavior in any way relating to the Company.        Any Employee who has any questions about the Code should consult with the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Company's audit committee (the "Audit Committee").         The Company has adopted the Code for the purposes of promoting:           X                    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;            X                    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to,the Securities and Exchange Commission    ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Company that are within the Senior Officer's area of responsibility;           X                    compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;            X                    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code; and           X                    accountability for adherence to the Code.                 1          
 
            HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT          Each Senior Officer and member of the Board owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid. Employees must adhere to a high standard of business ethics and are expected to make decisions and take actions based on the best interests of the Company, as a whole, and not based on personal relationships or benefits. Generally, a "conflict of interest" occurs when an Employee's personal interests is, or appears to be, inconsistent with, interferes with or is opposed to the best interests of the Company or gives the appearances of impropriety.         Business decisions and actions must be made in the best interests of the Company and should not be influenced by personal considerations or relationships. Relationships with the Company's stakeholders for example suppliers, competitors and customers should not in any way affect an Employee's responsibility and accountability to the Company. Conflicts of interests can arise when an Employee or a member of his or her family receive improper gifts, entertainment or benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company.         Specifically, each Employee must:         1.                 act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of information when required or consistent with the Company's policies;         2.                 avoid violations of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company in personal and professional relationships;         3.                 disclose to the Chief Executive Officer, President, or the Audit Committee any material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a breach      of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company;         4.                 obtain approval from the Chief Executive Officer, President or the Audit Committee before making any decisions or taking any action that could reasonably be expected to      involve a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest;          5.                 observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules and regulations, accounting standards and Company policies;         6.                 maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Company's financial records;         7.                 ensure full, fair, timely, accurate and understandable disclosure in the Company's periodic reports;          8.                 report any violations of the Code to the Chief Executive Officer, President or Audit Committee;              9.                 proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in his or her work environment; and         10.              maintain the skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of his or her duties.             2          
 
        DISCLOSURE          As a result of the Company's status as a public company, it is required to file periodic and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company takes its public disclosure responsibility seriously to ensure that these reports furnish the marketplace with full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure regarding the financial and business condition of the Company. All disclosures contained in reports and documents filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other government agencies, on behalf of the Company or contained in other public communications made by the Company must be complete and correct in all material respects and understandable to the intended recipient.         The Senior Officers, in relation to his or her area of responsibility, must be committed to providing timely, consistent and accurate information, in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. It is imperative that this disclosure be accomplished consistently during both good times and bad and that all parties in the marketplace have equal or similar access to this information.         All of the Company's books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company's transactions, and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company's systems of internal controls. Unrecorded or "off the book" funds, assets or liabilities should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation. Senior Officers involved in the preparation of the Company's financial statements must prepare those statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and any other applicable accounting standards and rules so that the financial statements materially, fairly and completely reflect the business transactions and financial statements and related condition of the Company. Further, it is important that financial statements and related disclosures be free of material errors.         Specifically, each Senior Officer must:         1.                 familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company;         2.                 not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, including the Company's independent auditors, governmental regulators,      self-regulating organizations and other governmental officials:         3.                 to the extent that he or she participates in the creation of the Company's books and records, promote the accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records; and         4.                 in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness.          3          
 
        CONFIDENTIALITY          In carrying out the Company's business, directors, officers and employees often learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company, its customers, clients, suppliers, or joint venture parties. Directors, officers and employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential or proprietary information of the Company, and of other companies, includes any nonpublic information that would be harmful to the relevant company or useful or helpful to competitors if disclosed.           COMPLIANCE          It is the Company's policy to comply with all applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations. It is the personal responsibility of each director, officer and employee to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.         It is against Company policy and a violation of federal securities laws for a director, officer or employee to trade in securities on the basis of material information not yet publicly disclosed. Any director, officer or employee who possesses nonpublic information about the Company or its business which is material in nature may not trade in any securities affected by such nonpublic information, including the Company's securities, until such time as the information has been made known to the public. A material fact about a company is one that a reasonable investor would be likely to consider important in making a decision to buy, sell or hold the securities of such company.         Any director, officer or employee who is uncertain about the legal rules involving a purchase or sale of any Company securities or any securities in companies that he or she is familiar with by virtue of his or her work for the Company, should consult the Audit Committee Chair.          FAIR DEALING          We have a history of succeeding through honest business competition. We do not seek competitive advantages through illegal or unethical business practices. Each director, officer and employee should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company's customers, clients, service providers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No director, officer or employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice.          REPORTING VIOLATIONS          The Company, through the Board's Audit Committee, is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions may arise and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. This Code is not intended to provide a comprehensive guideline for Senior Officers in relation to their business activities with the Company. Any Employee may seek clarification on the application of this Code from the Audit Committee.         4     

Each Employee must:         1.                 notify the Company of any existing or potential violation of this Code, and failure to do so is itself a breach of the Code; and         2.                 not retaliate, directly or indirectly, or encourage others to do so, against any Employee for reports, made in good faith, or any misconduct or violations of the Code solely   because that Employee raised a legitimate ethical issue.         The Audit Committee will take all action it considers appropriate to investigate any breach of the Code reported to it. All Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such investigations and to provide truthful and accurate information. If the Audit Committee determines that a breach has occurred, it will take or authorize disciplinary or preventative action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Company's counsel if warranted, up to and including termination of employment. Where appropriate, the Company will not limit itself to disciplinary action but may pursue legal action against the offending Employee involved. In some cases, the Company may have a legal or ethical obligation to call violations to the attention of appropriate enforcement authorities.         Compliance with the Code may be monitored by audits performed by the Audit Committee, the Company's counsel and/or by the Company's outside auditors. All Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such audits and to provide truthful and accurate information.         Any waiver of this Code for any Employee may be made only by the Board or the Audit Committee and will be promptly disclosed to stockholders and others, as required by applicable law. The Company must disclose changes to and waivers of the Code in accordance with applicable law.             5
