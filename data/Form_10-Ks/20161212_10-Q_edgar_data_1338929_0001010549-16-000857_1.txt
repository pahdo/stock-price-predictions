Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated in Nevada on March 25, 2005.  As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had 400,000,000 shares of authorized common stock.

On August 4, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company and the majority shareholders of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), at a ratio of 1-for-350 (the "Reverse Stock Split") effective at 5:00 p.m. EDT on August 15, 2014.  The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on August 6, 2014, and took effect on August 15, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. EDT.  As a result of the reverse stock split, every 350 shares of the Company's old authorized common stock was converted into one share of the Company's new authorized common stock.  All references to common stock shares have been adjusted to reflect the results of the reverse stock split.

Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. during the fourth quarter, 2013 became involved in the manufacturing and global distribution of ladies apparel.  Trident Merchant Group, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary which provided "value added" strategic advisory services. During the second quarter, 2014 the Company formed Leading Edge Fashions, LLC of which it controls 51%.  The non-controlling interest is recorded in the stockholders' deficit section. Effective December 31, 2014 the Company's Board of Directors determined it was in the best interest of the Company to discontinue the operations of Leading Edge Fashions, LLC.

The Company created a new limited liability company, Pure361, LLC ("Pure361") in May 2015 for the purpose of operating the portion of the Company's business that is involved with the collection, rejuvenation and manufacturing of garments and other accessories for the uniform marketplace that serves the hospitality, food service, medical, manufacturing, education, military, transportation and other commercial uniform industries.  The Company owns 51% of Pure361.  Pure361 entered into a license agreement with Pure System International Ltd. ("Pure") the minority owner of Pure 361, related to potential future operations, in which Pure361 was granted the exclusive license to use certain licensed intellectual property related to the manufacturing of uniforms from recyclable waste. 

The Company created a new wholly owned subsidiary, Progressive Fashions Inc. ("PFI") in February 2016 for the purpose of designing, producing and marketing the EMME  Activewear Collection.  The Company has had no operations to date.

Basis of Presentation: Unaudited Interim Financial Information

The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all of the normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations as of and for the periods presented. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

March 31, 2016

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS (Continued)

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the interim information presented not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Report on Form 10-K filed on November 21, 2016 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $29,359,761 and $28,911,878 as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, that include losses of $447,883 and $19,132,725 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Consequently, the aforementioned items raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, acquire an operating business and raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. Subsequent to March 31, 2016, the Company issued 600,000 shares of common stock in settlement of $785,764 of liabilities from discontinued operations. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are required or if the funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, management may be required to restructure the Company or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Costs of replacements and major improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation expense is provided primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, seven years.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue for the women's fashion division is recognized at the point-of-sale for retail store sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for the consulting division. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at stores and through the Company's direct-to-consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, the Company's need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for its retail and direct-to-consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for its consulting service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for consulting services are recognized as a sale upon completion of service.

The Company accounts for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on the Company's books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time the Company records the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale or when it is determined the likelihood of redemption is remote, based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to  Accounting Standards Codification  ("ASC") 740,  Income Taxes,  which utilizes the asset and liability method of computing deferred income taxes. The objective of this method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled.

ASC 740 also provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions must meet a "more-likely-than-not" recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized no adjustments for uncertain tax positions.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were recognized at March 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company expects no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The Company has not filed federal and state tax returns from inception through December 31, 2015. The tax periods since inception are open to examination by federal and state authorities.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

ASC Topic 360 (formerly FASB issued Statement No. 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("FAS 144") clarifies the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, including the disposal of business segments and major lines of business.  Long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  When necessary, impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair value based on the best information available. 

Use of Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value

FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s ("ASC 820") establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1   Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs;

Level 2   Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accrued compensation, accounts payable and other liabilities, accrued interest payable, and short-term portion of notes payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.

Earnings (Loss) per Share

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

NOTE 6   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

On March 15, 2015 the Company entered into a trademark license agreement with True Beauty, LLC which controls the trademark EMME.  EMME is a market pioneer and trusted voice of the "Full-Figured" market. Under this licensing agreement the Company will design, produce and market the EMME  Activewear Collection.

As of January 18, 2016, the Company is a party to one pending litigation matter entitled Randazzo LLC v. Avani Holdings LLC   Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff in order to evict Avani Holdings LLC from its rented premises in California and to recover unpaid rent. The Company does not operate out of that premises and has never signed any leases or other documents with the plaintiff. Consequently, management believes there to be no legitimate cause of action against the Company. However, the Company is attempting to resolve the matter due to the relatively small amount in controversy. The unpaid rent being sought by the plaintiff is $26,595.

As of January 18, 2016, the Company has been named as a defendant in the matter of Patrick Kalashyan v. Avani Holdings, LLC   Global Fashion Technologies, Inc.  This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff to recover monies owed on a September 23, 2011 settlement agreement signed between the Plaintiff and Avani Holdings, LLC.  The Company is not party to this agreement and never completed purchase of Avani Holdings, LLC.  Consequently, management believes there is no legitimate cause of action against the Company.  The Company is vigorously defending its position in the lawsuit.  The amount being sought by the plaintiff is $150,000 plus interest.

Company Overview

Global Fashion Technologies Inc. ("GFTI", 'We" or the "Company") is a development stage rejuvenation technology company which will be offering branded fabrics, apparel and uniforms to the corporate, hotel, hospital and military markets.  We will achieve this by utilizing a patented and proprietary process for rejuvenating textile waste into high quality fabrics and apparel.  In addition, we will also be offering branded apparel into both online and brick and mortar environments.  This will initially be through a license we signed with EMME , a former Ford Supermodel, for the purposes of marketing and manufacturing the EMME  brand of Activewear to the vastly under-served curvy/plus size market.

The Women's Apparel Segment

On March 15, 2015 the Company entered into a trademark license agreement with True Beauty, LLC which controls the trademark EMME  .  EMME  is a market pioneer and trusted voice of the "Full-Figured" market. Under this licensing agreement the Company will design, produce and market the EMME  Activewear Collection.  The Company created a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Progressive Fashions Inc. in February 2016 for the purpose of desgining, producing and marketing the EMME  Activewear Collection.

As of November 1, 2016, the Company has completed the design of the Spring 2017 line and has received quotes from contract manufacturers.  Samples for fitting have been requested from the selected vendors.  The Fall 2017 line concept has been created and is now ready to enter into design phase.

The Rejuvenated Uniform Segment

In April 2015, we entered into a joint venture and license agreement with Pure Systems International, Ltd. to produce and market garments and other accessories for the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals by utilizing Pure Systems International, Ltd.'s patented processes to up-cycle pre-consumer textile waste into reusable fiber of equal or better quality than the original fabric.  (the "Rejuvenated Fiber")

In May of 2015, the Company created a new limited liability company, Pure361, LLC ("Pure361") of which the Company owns 51% and Pure Systems International, Ltd. owns 49%.  Pure361 has the exclusive licensee to use Pure System International Ltd.'s patented Rejuvenated Fiber in conjunction with the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals.

The Rejuvenated Cardboard Segment

In conjunction with its focus on rejuvenated technologies, the Company is exploring the possibility of also manufacturing a rejuvenated cardboard product, and is in the early stages of exploring this potential opportunity.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Material Changes in Financial Condition

As of March 31, 2016, our current assets were $12,720 as compared to $42,989 in current assets as of December 31, 2015.

As of March 31, 2016, our current liabilities were $1,260,540 as compared to $1,307,098 in current liabilities as of December 31, 2015.  This change in the Company's financial condition was primarily related to a discount issued related to the extension of a note in consideration for 200,000 shares of common stock valued at $100,000 the repayment of a related party advance of $11,058, partially offset by an increase in accrued compensation of $36,000 and accounts payable and accrued interest of $28,500.

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $19,211 compared to net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2015 of $60,981.  Cash provided by or used by operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include stock compensation expense and stock issued for services. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 of $447,883 was essentially offset by these non-cash adjustments totaling $364,172. Changes in assets and liabilities provided an additional offset to the net loss of $64,500.

Net cash flows used in investing activities consisted of $0 in additions to property and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to $2,650 for the three months ended March 31, 2015.

Net cash used in financing activities of $11,058 for the three month period ending March 31, 2016 was due to the repayment of a related party advance.

We are currently dependent upon receiving loans from our shareholders. We expect to raise additional capital to continue moving the Company towards profitability.

The Company does not currently have any substantial revenues, and is reliant on its ability to raise additional capital to continue execution of its business plan to move the Company forward towards profitability.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015

The Company experienced a net loss of $447,883 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to net loss of $8,487,171 in the first quarter of 2015.  The change was due to a decrease in revenue of $4,000, a decrease in debt extinguishment costs of $8,465,034, a decrease in interest expense of $3,176, an increase in consulting fees share expense of $314,172, and increase in stock based compensation of $50,000, and an increase in general and administrative expense of $60,750 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015.

General and administrative costs increased to $80,211 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to $19,461 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase of $60,750 is a result of an increase in first quarter operating expenses from 2015 to 2016 of $24,750, and an increase in accrued compensation of $36,000.

Interest expense was $3,500 and $6,676 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Item 3.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by  229.10(f)(1) and therefore is not required to provide the information required by this Item.

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2016.  Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.       Legal Proceedings. 

As of the date of this filing, the Company is a party to two pending litigation matters.  One matter is entitled   Randazzo LLC v. Avani Holdings LLC   Global Fashion Technologies, Inc.    This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff in order to evict Avani Holdings LLC from its rented premises in California and to recover unpaid rent.  GFTI does not operate out of the premises in question and has never signed any leases or other documents with the plaintiff.  A judgment of eviction was entered, but GFTI does not operate out of the premises in question and therefore did not appear in the matter to oppose the judgment of eviction.  The plaintiff is also seeking unpaid rent in the amount of $26,595. 

The second matter is entitled   Patrick Kalashyan v. Avani Holdings, LLC   Global Fashion Technologies, Inc  .    This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff to recover monies owed on   a September 23, 2011 settlement agreement signed between the Plaintiff and Avani Holdings, LLC.  The Company was never a party to this agreement and never acquired Avani Holdings, LLC.  Consequently, there is no legitimate cause of action against the Company, and the Company is vigorously defending itself as it has no legal liability for a debt of Avani Holdings, LLC.  The amount being sought by the plaintiff is $150,000 plus interest.
