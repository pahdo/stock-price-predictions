  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (in millions, except per-share data and where otherwise noted) 

Note 1   Basis of Presentation  
  References herein to  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  and  Xerox  refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise. 
  We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting policies described in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2015 Annual Report), and the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2015 Annual Report. 
  In our opinion, all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been made. These adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year. 
  For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption  Income (Loss) before Income Taxes and Equity Income  as  pre-tax income (loss).   
    
  Separation Update 
  On January 29, 2016, Xerox announced plans for the complete legal and structural separation of the Company's Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business, to be named Conduent Incorporated (Conduent), from its Document Technology and Document Outsourcing (DT/DO) business, which will retain the Xerox Corporation name. Each of the businesses will operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. The transaction is intended to be tax-free for Xerox shareholders for federal income tax purposes.  
  During third quarter 2016, the CFO for Conduent was announced, and several amendments to the Form 10 registration statement for Conduent were filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
  including one that provided additional information on its pro-forma capitalization and results and another that named 
  the majority of its executive management and   seven   of   nine   of its directors. Also, Xerox's credit ratings remain investment grade following recent updates from the major rating agencies. Conduent is expected to be a high non-investment grade rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with management's expectations. In addition, we released Conduent's brand identity and announced that its stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "CNDT" while Xerox will continue to trade on the NYSE as "XRX". 
  Xerox has begun the process to separate and is finalizing the transaction structure, which is predicated on a spin-off of the BPO business. To effect the separation, Xerox   is currently undertaking   a series of internal transactions, following which Conduent will hold, directly or through its subsidiaries, the BPO business. The separation will be completed by way of a pro rata distribution of Conduent shares held by Xerox to Xerox's shareholders. 
  Our objective is to complete the separation by year-end 2016, subject to customary regulatory approvals, the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, tax considerations, securing any necessary financing and final approval of the Xerox Board of Directors. Until the separation is complete, we will continue to operate and report as a single company, and it will continue to be business as usual for our customers and employees. 
  In conjunction with the separation, Xerox also began a   three  -year Strategic Transformation program targeting a cumulative $  2.4   billion of savings across all segments. The program is inclusive of ongoing activities and   $600   of incremental transformation initiatives. Refer to Note 9- Restructuring Programs for additional information.

Note 2   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued   ASU 2014-09  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2017. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued the following ASU s which amend or provide additional guidance on topics addressed in ASU 2014-09. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue Recognition - Principal versus Agent (reporting revenue gross versus net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue Recognition - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licenses. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue Recognition - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. We will adopt this standard beginning January 1, 2018, and we will use the modified retrospective method. We continue to evaluate the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-02  ,   Leases  . This update requires the recognition of leased assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under existing lease guidance.  Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized.  The update also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance as well as to the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09.  This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-15  , Statement of Cash Flows -   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This update provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues where current GAAP is either unclear or does not include specific guidance. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. This update includes specific guidance which requires cash collected on beneficial interests received in a sale of receivables be classified as inflows from investing activities. Currently, those collections are reported in operating cash flows. We reported   $211   and   $305   of collections on beneficial interests as operating cash inflows on the Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The other seven issues noted in this update are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Stock Compensation 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-09  ,   Compensation - Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-Based payment Accounting (Topic 718).   This update includes provisions to simplify certain aspects related to the accounting for share-based awards and the related financial statement presentation. The update also requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled as compared to equity as allowed under certain conditions by current US GAAP. This change is required to be adopted prospectively in the period of adoption. In addition, the ASU modifies the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statements of cash flows and these changes are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 for the most part is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the update may add volatility to our income tax expense in future periods depending upon, among other things, the level of tax expense and the price of the Company's common stock at the date of vesting for share-based awards. 
  Income Taxes 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-16  , Income Taxes -   Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.    This update requires recognition of the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis

through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements.    
  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-13     Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  Equity Method Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-07  ,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  . This update eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method, an investor must restate its historical financial statements, as if the equity method had been used during all previous periods. Under the new guidance, at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method, any unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) ("AOCI") will be recognized through earnings. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Interest 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-03  ,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   This update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-15  , which indicated that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing those costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings. All of our debt issuance costs were reported as deferred charges in Other long-term assets and were $  32   at December 31, 2015,   $4   of which is related to our credit agreement. Upon adoption of this update effective January 1, 2016, we reclassified $  28   of debt issuance costs to long-term debt. Prior periods were retroactively revised. The costs associated with our credit agreement will continue to be reported as a deferred charge in Other long-term assets. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have any effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Other Updates 
  In 2016 and 2015, the FASB also issued the following Accounting Standards Updates which are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows when adopted in future periods. Those updates are as follows: 
             
    Financial Instruments - Classification and Measurement:     ASU 2016-01  ,   Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments and Financial Liabilities.   This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. 

Derivatives and Hedging:     ASU 2016-06  ,   Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments,   which is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. 

Derivatives and Hedging:     ASU 2016-05  ,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,   which is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. 

Inventory:     ASU 2015-11  ,   Simplifying the Subsequent Measurement of Inventory,   which is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. 

Disclosures of Going Concern Uncertainties:     ASU 2014-15  ,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40); Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which is effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

Stock Compensation:     ASU 2014-12  ,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period,   which was effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016.  
      
  Note 3   Segment Reporting 
  Our reportable segments are aligned with how we manage the business and view the markets we serve. We report our financial performance based on the following   two   primary reportable segments     Services and Document Technology  . Our Services segment operations involve delivery of business process and document outsourcing services for a broad range of customers from small businesses to large global enterprises. Our Document Technology segment includes the sale and support of a broad range of document systems from entry level to high-end.  
  In the first quarter of 2016, we revised our segment reporting to reflect the following changes: 
             
    The transfer of the Education/Student Loan business from the Services segment to Other as a result of the expected continued run-off of this business. This business does not meet the threshold for separate segment reporting. 
                
    The exclusion of the non-service elements of our defined-benefit pension and retiree-health plan costs from Segment profit. 
       
  Prior year amounts were accordingly revised to reflect these changes. 
    
  The   Services   segment is comprised of   two   outsourcing service offerings: 

Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) 
                
    Document Outsourcing (which includes Managed Print Services) (DO) 
     Business process outsourcing services include service arrangements where we manage a customer s business activity or process. We provide multi-industry offerings such as customer care, transaction processing, finance and accounting, and human resources, as well as industry-focused offerings in areas such as healthcare, transportation, financial services, retail and telecommunications. Document outsourcing services include service arrangements that allow customers to streamline, simplify and digitize their document-intensive business processes through automation and deployment of software applications and tools and the management of their printing needs. Document outsourcing also includes revenues from our partner print services offerings.  
  Our   Document Technology   segment includes the sale of document systems and supplies, provision of technical service and financing of products. Our products groupings range from: 

Entry,    which includes A4 devices and desktop printers; to 
                
     Mid-range,    which includes A3 devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid to large enterprises and includes products that fall into the following market categories: Color 41+ ppm priced at less than $100K and Light Production 91+ ppm priced at less than $100K; to 
                
     High-end,    which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic communications marketplace and large enterprises. 
     Customers range from small and mid-sized businesses to large enterprises. Customers also include graphic communication enterprises as well as channel partners including distributors and resellers. Segment revenues reflect the sale of document systems and supplies, technical services and product financing.  
    
  Other   includes several units, none of which meet the thresholds for separate segment reporting. This group includes paper sales in our developing market countries, Wide Format Systems, licensing revenues, Global Imaging Systems (GIS) network integration solutions, electronic presentation systems, Education/Student Loan business and non-allocated corporate items including non-financing interest and other items included in Other expenses, net.

  Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO)  
  In 2014, we announced an agreement to sell our ITO business to Atos SE (Atos).  As a result of this agreement, we reported the ITO business as held for sale and a discontinued operation up through its date of sale, which was completed on June 30, 2015.  
  In February 2016, we reached an agreement with Atos on the final adjustments to the closing balance of net assets sold as well as the settlement of certain indemnifications and recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the disposal in 2015 of   $24   (  $14     after-tax). This additional loss was recorded in the 2015 financial statements because the agreement with Atos was reached before the financial statements had been issued, accordingly no adjustment was required in 2016. In the first quarter 2016, we paid Atos approximately   $52  , representing a   $28   adjustment to the final sales price as a result of this agreement and a payment of   $24   due from closing. The payment is reflected in Investing cash flows as an adjustment of the sales proceeds.

    ITO Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excludes approximately   $80   of depreciation and amortization expenses (including   $14   of intangible amortization) since the business was held for sale. 

Note 5   Accounts Receivable, Net 
  Accounts receivable, net were as follows:    

Unbilled receivables include receivables associated with percentage-of-completion accounting and other earned revenues not currently billable due to contractual provisions. Amounts to be invoiced in the subsequent month for current services provided are included in amounts billable, and at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were approximately   $843   and   $849  , respectively. 
    
  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience, as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends.  
  Accounts Receivable Sales Arrangements 
  Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management. We have facilities in the U.S., Canada and several countries in Europe that enable us to sell to third parties certain accounts receivable without recourse. The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days.  
  All of our arrangements involve the sale of our entire interest in groups of accounts receivable for cash. In most instances, a portion of the sales proceeds is held back by the purchaser and payment is deferred until collection of the related receivables sold. Such holdbacks are not considered legal securities nor are they certificated. We report collections on such receivables as operating cash flows in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because such receivables are the result of an operating activity and the associated interest rate risk is de minimis due to its short-term nature. Our risk of loss following the sales of accounts receivable is limited to the outstanding deferred purchase price receivable. These receivables are included in Other current assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and were   $55   and   $61   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Under most of the arrangements, we continue to service the sold accounts receivable. When applicable, a servicing liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the servicing. The amounts associated with the servicing liability were not material.  
  
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q

Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet,   $540   and   $660   remained uncollected as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  Accounts receivable sales were as follows:

  Note 6 - Finance Receivables, Net  
  Sale of Finance Receivables 
  In   2013   and   2012  , we transferred our entire interest in certain groups of lease finance receivables to third-party entities for cash proceeds and beneficial interests. The transfers were accounted for as sales with derecognition of the associated lease receivables. There have been no transfers of finance receivables since the year ended   December 31, 2013  . We continue to service the sold receivables and record servicing fee income over the expected life of the associated receivables. 
  The following is a summary of our prior sales activity.  

The principal value of finance receivables derecognized from our balance sheet was   $107   and   $238   (sales value of approximately   $115   and   $256  ) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The lease portfolios transferred and sold were from our Document Technology segment. The ultimate purchaser has no recourse to our other assets for the failure of customers to pay principal and interest when due beyond our beneficial interests, which were   $26   and   $38   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in Other current assets and Other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beneficial interests of   $16   and   $30   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are held by bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries and therefore are not available to satisfy any of our creditor obligations. We report collections on the beneficial interests as operating cash flows in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because such beneficial interests are the result of an operating activity, and the associated interest rate risk is de minimis considering their weighted average lives of less than   2   years. 
    
  The net impact from the sales of finance receivables on operating cash flows is summarized below:

Finance Receivables   Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Quality  
  Finance receivables include sales-type leases, direct financing leases and installment loans. Our finance receivable portfolios are primarily in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We generally establish customer credit limits and estimate the allowance for credit losses on a country or geographic basis. Our policy and methodology used to establish our allowance for doubtful accounts has been consistently applied over all periods presented. 
    
  The following table is a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful finance receivables as well as the related investment in finance receivables: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    In the first quarter 2016, as a result of an internal reorganization, a U.S. leasing unit previously classified in Other was reclassified to the U.S. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to current year presentation. 
              (2) 
    Includes developing market countries and smaller units. 
              (3) 
    Includes the impacts of foreign currency translation and adjustments to reserves necessary to reflect events of non-payment such as customer accommodations and contract terminations. 
      We evaluate our customers based on the following credit quality indicators: 
             
    Investment grade:   This rating includes accounts with excellent to good business credit, asset quality and the capacity to meet financial obligations. These customers are less susceptible to adverse effects due to shifts in economic conditions or changes in circumstance. The rating generally equates to a Standard   Poors (S P) rating of BBB- or better. Loss rates in this category are normally minimal at less than   1%  . 
     
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  14 

Non-investment grade:   This rating includes accounts with average credit risk that are more susceptible to loss in the event of adverse business or economic conditions. This rating generally equates to a BB S P rating. Although we experience higher loss rates associated with this customer class, we believe the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that our leases are fairly well dispersed across a large and diverse customer base. In addition, the higher loss rates are largely offset by the higher rates of return we obtain on such leases. Loss rates in this category are generally in the range of   2%   to   4%  . 
                
    Substandard:   This rating includes accounts that have marginal credit risk such that the customer s ability to make repayment is impaired or may likely become impaired. We use numerous strategies to mitigate risk including higher rates of interest, prepayments, personal guarantees, etc. Accounts in this category include customers who were downgraded during the term of the lease from investment and non-investment grade status when the lease was originated. Accordingly, there is a distinct possibility for a loss of principal and interest or customer default. The loss rates in this category are approximately   10%  . 
       
  Credit quality indicators are updated at least annually and the credit quality of any given customer can change during the life of the portfolio. Details about our finance receivables portfolio based on industry and credit quality indicators are as follows:

Note 9   Restructuring Programs 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of   $199  , which included approximately   $218   of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately   5,700   employees worldwide,   $4   of lease cancellation costs and   $2   of asset impairments. These costs were offset by   $20   of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives, as well as a gain of   $5   from the sale of real estate impaired in prior periods.  
  We also recorded   $30   of costs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program. 
  Information related to restructuring program activity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is outlined below:

Note 10   Debt 
  Term Loan Facility     
  On March 4, 2016, Xerox Corporation entered into a   $1.0   billion senior unsecured term facility. The facility was fully drawn by April 1, 2016 and must be repaid on the earlier of   364   days or upon receipt of financing related to the separation of the Company into   two   independent publicly traded companies. Refer to Note 1- Basis of Presentation for information regarding the planned Company separation.  Borrowings under the facility currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   1.50%   and current interest rates vary between   2.02%   and   2.15%  . 
  The proceeds of the facility were used to repay maturing debt of $  950   ($  700   of   6.40%   Senior Notes on March 15, 2016 and $  250   of   7.20%   Notes on April 1, 2016).

Note 11   Financial Instruments  
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt. These derivatives may be designated as   fair value hedges   or   cash flow hedges   depending on the nature of the risk being hedged. 
  Fair Value Hedges  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , pay variable/receive fixed interest rate swaps with notional amounts of   $300   and net asset fair value of   $15   were designated and accounted for as fair value hedges. The swaps were structured to hedge the fair value of related debt by converting them from fixed rate instruments to variable rate instruments.  
  The following is a summary of our fair value hedges at   September 30, 2016  :  

Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
  We are a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business. As a part of our foreign exchange risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts and purchased option contracts, to hedge the following foreign currency exposures, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities: 

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities 
                
    Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency 
     
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  19 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of   $2,473   and   $3,212   respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at   September 30, 2016   were consistent with year-end currency exposures, and there has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.  
  Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges 
  We designate a portion of our foreign currency derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of our foreign currency-denominated expenses. The net asset (liability) fair value of these contracts were   $22   and   $(1)   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

At   September 30, 2016  , a net after-tax gain of   $25   was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity. The entire balance is expected to be reclassified into net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 
  Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses) 
  Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability. 
  The following table provides a summary of gains (losses) on non-designated derivative instruments: 

Net currency gains and losses are included in Other expenses, net and include the mark-to-market adjustments of the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the related cost of those derivatives as well as the re-measurement of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , currency losses, net were   $3   and   $4  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , currency losses, net were   $3   and   $4  , respectively. 

Note 12   Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
  The following table represents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The basis for the measurement at fair value in all cases is Level 2   Significant Other Observable Inputs.    

We utilize the income approach to measure the fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2. 
  Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in Company-owned life insurance is reflected at cash surrender value. Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for actively traded investments similar to those held by the plan. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees  investment selections, based on quoted prices for similar assets in actively traded markets. 
  Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The estimated fair values of our other financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 
  
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  21 

The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

_____________________________ 
           (1) 
    The net actuarial loss (gain) for U.S. Plans primarily reflects (i) the remeasurement of our primary U.S. pension plans as a result of the payment of periodic settlements; and (ii) adjustments for the actuarial valuation results based on January 1st plan census data. 
              (2) 
     Amounts represent the pre-tax effect included within Other comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 15 - Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income for related tax effects and the after-tax amounts. 
     Contributions  
  The following table summarizes cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans.    

  ___________ 
           (1) 
    These full year estimates are based on current expectations that we will make additional 2016 cash contributions of   $34   (  $5   U.S. and   $29   Non-U.S) to our defined benefit pension plans and   $19   to our retiree health benefit plans.  
     The 2016 expected pension plan contributions do not include any planned contributions for our domestic tax-qualified defined benefit plans because none are required to meet the minimum funding requirements. However, the desirability of making additional contributions will continue to be assessed, and we may voluntarily decide to contribute to these plans before the end of the year. 
  Plan Amendments 
  In June 2015, we amended our U.S. Retiree Health Plan to eliminate future benefit accruals for active salaried employees effective December 31, 2015. There was no change in benefits for union employees or existing retirees or employees that retired before December 31, 2015. As a result of this plan amendment, we recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain of $  22   in the second quarter 2015. The gain represents the recognition of deferred gains from  
  
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q

other prior-year amendments ( prior service credits ) as a result of the discontinuation of the future benefit or service accrual period for active salaried employees.

Note 17   Contingencies and Litigation  
  Legal Matters 
  We are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law, commercial and contracts law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and regulatory matters. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. 
  Brazil Tax and Labor Contingencies 
  Our Brazilian operations are involved in various litigation matters and have received, or been the subject of, numerous governmental assessments related to indirect and other taxes, as well as disputes associated with former employees and contract labor. The tax matters, which comprise a significant portion of the total contingencies, principally relate to claims for taxes on the internal transfer of inventory, municipal service taxes on rentals, gross revenue taxes and import taxes and duties. We are disputing these tax matters and intend to vigorously defend our position. Based on the opinion of legal counsel and current reserves for those matters deemed probable of loss, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The labor matters principally relate to claims made by former employees and contract labor for the equivalent payment of all social security and other related labor benefits, as well as consequential tax claims, as if they were regular employees.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total amounts related to the unreserved portion of the tax and labor contingencies, inclusive of any related interest, amounted to approximately   $749  , with the increase from our   December 31, 2015   balance of approximately   $577   primarily related to currency and interest. With respect to the unreserved balance of   $749  , the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company. In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $85   of escrow cash deposits for matters we are disputing, and there are liens on certain Brazilian assets with a net book value of   $4  , and additional letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately   $141   and   $91  , respectively, which include associated indexation. Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor. We routinely assess all these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable. 
  Litigation Against the Company  
  State of Texas v. Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC, and ACS State Healthcare, LLC:   On May 9, 2014, the State of Texas, via the Texas Office of Attorney General (the  State ), filed a lawsuit in the 53rd Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas. The lawsuit alleges that Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC and ACS State Healthcare (collectively, the "Xerox Defendants") violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act in the administration of its contract with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services ( HHSC ). The State alleges that the Xerox Defendants made false representations of material facts regarding the processes, procedures, implementation and results regarding the prior authorization of orthodontic claims. The State seeks recovery of actual damages,   two   times the amount of any overpayments made as a result of unlawful acts, civil penalties, pre- and post-judgment interest and all costs and attorneys  fees. The State references the amount in controversy as exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. The Xerox Defendants filed their Answer in June, 2014 denying all allegations. The Xerox Defendants will continue to vigorously defend themselves in this matter.  We do not believe it is probable that we will incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued for this matter. In the course of litigation, we periodically engage in discussions with plaintiff s counsel for possible resolution of the matter. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement for a significant amount, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of

operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. 
    
  Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v. Xerox Corporation, Ursula M. Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn A. Mikells, Lynn R. Blodgett and Robert K. Zapfel:     On October 21, 2016, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System ( plaintiff ) filed a purported securities class action complaint against Xerox Corporation, Ursula Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn Mikells, Lynn Blodgett and Robert Zapfel in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the plaintiff and certain purchasers or acquirers of Xerox common stock. The complaint alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, relating to the operations and prospects of Xerox s Health Enterprise business. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary damages and attorneys  fees. Other, similar lawsuits may follow. Xerox and the individual defendants will vigorously defend against this matter. At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs. 
    
  Other Matters 
  On January 5, 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) notified Xerox Education Services, Inc. (XES) that, in accordance with the CFPB s discretionary Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process, the CFPB s Office of Enforcement is considering recommending that the CFPB take legal action against XES, alleging that XES violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act s prohibition of unfair practices. Should the CFPB commence an action, it may seek restitution, civil monetary penalties, injunctive relief or other corrective action. The purpose of a NORA letter is to provide a party being investigated an opportunity to present its position to the CFPB before an enforcement action is recommended or commenced. This notice stems from an inquiry that commenced in 2014 when the Company, through XES, received and responded to a Civil Investigative Demand containing a broad request for information. During this process, XES self-disclosed to the Department of Education and the CFPB certain adjustments it had become aware that had not been timely made relating to its servicing of a small percentage of third-party student loans under outsourcing arrangements for various financial institutions. The CFPB and the Department of Education, as well as certain states' attorney general offices and other regulatory agencies, began similar reviews. The Company has cooperated and continues to fully cooperate with all regulatory agencies, and XES has submitted its NORA response. The Company cannot provide assurance that the CFPB or another party will not ultimately commence a legal action against XES in this matter nor is the Company able to predict the likely outcome of the investigations into this matter. 
  Other Contingencies  
  We have issued or provided the following guarantees as of   September 30, 2016  : 

$344   for letters of credit issued to (i) guarantee our performance under certain services contracts; (ii) support certain insurance programs; and (iii) support our obligations related to the Brazil tax and labor contingencies. 
                
    $775   for outstanding surety bonds. Certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations. 
     
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  28 

In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support. 
    
  We have service arrangements where we service third party student loans in the Federal Family Education Loan program (FFEL) on behalf of various financial institutions. We service these loans for investors under outsourcing arrangements and do not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party. At   September 30, 2016  , we serviced a FFEL portfolio of approximately   1.6   million loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately   $24.1   billion. Some servicing agreements contain provisions that, under certain circumstances, require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error. If defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period, any obligation we may have to purchase these loans expires. Loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured, the guaranty reinstated and the loans repackaged for sale to third parties. We evaluate our exposure under our purchase obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses, or default liability reserve, through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased. The reserve is evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management s analysis of the historical performance of the defaulted loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , other current liabilities included reserves of approximately   $4   for losses on defaulted loans purchased. In addition to potential purchase obligations arising from servicing errors, various laws and regulations applicable to student loan borrowers could give rise to fines, penalties and other liabilities associated with loan servicing errors. 
  Indemnifications  
  We have indemnified, subject to certain deductibles and limits, the purchasers of businesses or divested assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of our divestiture agreements. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Since the obligated amounts of these types of indemnifications are often not explicitly stated and/or are contingent on the occurrence of future events, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not historically made significant payments for these indemnifications. Additionally, under certain of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial targets are achieved post-closing. We have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of acquisition. Contingent obligations related to indemnifications arising from our divestitures and contingent consideration provided for by our acquisitions are not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis (MD A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Xerox Corporation. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. 
  Throughout this document, references to  we,   our,  the  Company,  and  Xerox  refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to  Xerox Corporation  refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries. 
  Currency Impact 
  To understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency";  currency impact  or  the impact from currency.  This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. In 2016 we revised our calculation of the currency impact on revenue growth, or constant currency revenue growth, to include the currency impacts from the developing market countries (Latin America, Brazil, Middle East, India, Eurasia and Central-Eastern Europe), which had been previously excluded from the calculation. As a result of economic changes in these markets over the past few years, we currently manage our exchange risk in our developing market countries in a similar manner to the exchange risk in our developed market countries, and therefore, the exclusion of the developing market countries from the calculation of the currency effect is no longer warranted. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. 

Overview   
  Separation   Update 
  On January 29, 2016, Xerox announced plans for the complete legal and structural separation of the Company's Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business, to be named Conduent Incorporated (Conduent), from its Document Technology and Document Outsourcing (DT/DO) business, which will retain the Xerox Corporation name. Each of the businesses will operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. The transaction is intended to be tax-free for Xerox shareholders for federal income tax purposes.   
  During third quarter 2016, the CFO for Conduent was announced, and several amendments to the Form 10 registration statement for Conduent were filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including one that provided additional information on its pro-forma capitalization and results and another that named the majority of its executive management and seven of nine of its directors. Also, Xerox's credit ratings remain investment grade following recent updates from the major rating agencies. Conduent is expected to be a high non-investment grade rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with management s expectations. In addition, we released Conduent's brand identity and announced that its stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "CNDT" while Xerox will continue to trade on the NYSE as "XRX". 
  Xerox has begun the process to separate and is finalizing the transaction structure, which is predicated on a spin-off of the BPO business. To effect the separation, Xerox is currently undertaking a series of internal transactions, following which Conduent will hold, directly or through its subsidiaries, the BPO business. The separation will be completed by way of a pro rata distribution of Conduent shares held by Xerox to Xerox's shareholders. 
  Our objective is to complete the separation by year-end 2016, subject to customary regulatory approvals, the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, tax considerations, securing any necessary financing and final approval of the Xerox Board of Directors. Until the separation is complete, we will continue to operate and report as a single company, and it will continue to be business as usual for our customers and employees. 
  In conjunction with the separation, Xerox also began a three-year Strategic Transformation program targeting a cumulative $2.4 billion savings across all segments. The program is inclusive of ongoing activities and $600 million of incremental transformation initiatives.

2015 Health Enterprise (HE) Charge 
  Prior year results include a pre-tax charge (HE charge) of $389 million ($241 million after-tax or $0.23 cents per share) associated with our third quarter 2015 decision to not fully complete the HE implementations in California and Montana. The charge included a $116 million reduction to revenues with the remaining $273 million recorded to costs of outsourcing, maintenance and rentals. As a result of the significant year-over-year impact of the HE charge on our reported revenues, earnings and key metrics, we are also comparing our current year results to adjusted prior year results, which exclude the HE charge. These adjusted results and comparisons are noted as "adjusted" in the discussion below. 
  Third   Quarter 2016 Review 
  Although revenues were lower in both segments as compared to the prior year, the third quarter 2016 results reflected the following: 
             
    Continued cost and productivity progress from on-going restructuring and our Strategic Transformation program resulting in margin improvement in Services and solid margins in Document Technology. 
                
    Strong Services renewal opportunities and an 86% renewal rate, which drove overall signings growth. 
                
    Higher year-over-year operating cash flow reflecting the strength of our annuity based business model. 
     Total revenue of $4.2 billion for the   third   quarter 2016 declined 3% from   third   quarter   2015  . On an adjusted   1    basis, excluding the third quarter 2015 HE charge, total revenues decreased 5%, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. Services segment revenues of $2.4 billion, which represented 57% of total revenues, increased 1%. On an adjusted   1    basis, Services segment revenue decreased 3%, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency as a 4% decrease in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) revenues was partially offset by a 1% increase in Document Outsourcing revenues. Services segment margin of 9.4% increased 17.7-percentage points from   third   quarter 2015, or 1.6-percentage points on an adjusted   1    basis, primarily reflecting cost and productivity improvements across our BPO business. Document Technology segment revenues of $1.6 billion decreased by 9%, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Although Document Technology segment margin of 13.1% decreased 0.8-percentage points as compared to prior year, it improved sequentially and reflects continued productivity gains and cost savings from the company s strategic transformation program.  
  Total revenue of $12.9 billion for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   declined 4% from the prior year. On an adjusted   1    basis, excluding the third quarter 2015 HE charge, total revenue declined 5%, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Services segment revenues of $7.4 billion, which represented 57% of total revenues, was relatively flat compared to the prior year. On an adjusted   1    basis, Services segment revenues declined 2% compared to the prior year, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Services segment margin of 8.9% increased 6.6-percentage points from the prior year or 1.4-percentage points on an adjusted   1    basis. Document Technology segment revenues of $5.0 billion decreased by 9%, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Document Technology segment margin of 12.0% decreased 1-percentage point as compared to prior year.  
  Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $181 million and $370 million, respectively, and included after-tax costs of $105 million and $458 million, respectively, related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and separation costs, resulting in adjusted   1    net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox of $286 million and $828 million, respectively.  Net (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was $(31) million and $267 million, respectively, and included after-tax costs of $320 million and $564 million, respectively, related to the amortization of intangible assets, the HE charge, restructuring and related costs and non-service retirement-related costs, resulting in adjusted   1    net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox of $289 million and $831 million, respectively. Adjusted   1    net income for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016 periods were relatively flat as compared to the prior year periods as lower operating profit was offset by lower income taxes.  
  
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q

Cash provided by operating activities was $522 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $733 million in the prior year period. The $211 million decrease is primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings before non-cash charges, increased working capital and payments related to the prior year Health Enterprise settlement and separation costs. Cash used in investing activities of $261 million includes a $52 million payment to Atos, reflecting the final working capital adjustments associated with the 2015 sale of the ITO business, and capital expenditures (including internal use software) of $218 million. Cash used in financing activities of $213 million primarily reflects $246 million for dividends and $13 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests partially offset by $41 million of net proceeds on debt. 
  2016 Outlook  
  We continue to expect total revenues to decline 2 to 4% in 2016, excluding the impact of currency which at September 30, 2016 exchange rates, is expected to have about a 1-percentage point negative impact on total revenues in 2016. We expect Services segment revenues to be flat to down 1% on an adjusted basis (excluding the HE Charge from 2015 and currency) and we expect full year segment margin to be in line with the third quarter 2016. We continue to expect a 5 to 7% revenue decline before the impact of currency in Document Technology with segment margin in the 12 to 14% range. 
  2016 full-year earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by separation costs estimated at $175 million to $200 million as well as restructuring and related costs of about $300 million. We also expect to incur additional tax costs related to the separation, which are currently estimated to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million. Reported and adjusted earnings are anticipated to be in line with our full-year expectations.  
    
  We expect full year 2016 cash flows from operations to be between $950 million and $1.2 billion reflecting increased cash requirements for separation costs and restructuring. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million.  
  Recent Developments  
  On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held in the United Kingdom in which it was decided that the United Kingdom would withdraw from the European Union ( Brexit ). The uncertainty related to the impact of Brexit caused financial market volatility during the current period, and we anticipate this volatility will likely continue into the future. Brexit did not, however, have a material impact on our financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016. Approximately 5% of the Company's total revenues are pound sterling-denominated, and approximately 15% are Euro-denominated.

  Revenues  
   
 _______________ 
  (1) Refer to the Revenue/Segment reconciliation table in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. 
  CC - See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section for description of Constant Currency. 
    
  Total revenue   for   third   quarter   2016   decreased 3% as compared to   third   quarter   2015  . On an adjusted   1    basis, excluding the third quarter 2015 HE charge, total revenues decreased 5%, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency.  On a revenue-weighted basis, our major European currencies and the Canadian Dollar were approximately 3% weaker against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year. Revenues from these major foreign currencies comprise approximately 25% of our total consolidated revenues (revenues from the Pound Sterling represent approximately 5% of the total), while overall non-U.S. revenues represent almost one third of the total.   Third   quarter   2016   total revenues reflect the following: 
             
    Annuity revenue   decreased 2% as compared to   third   quarter   2015  . On an adjusted   1    basis, annuity revenue decreased 5%, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. Annuity revenue is comprised of the following: 
                
    Outsourcing, maintenance and rentals revenue   of $3,053 million includes outsourcing revenue within our Services segment and maintenance revenue (including bundled supplies) and rental revenue, both primarily within our Document Technology segment. These revenues declined 1%, or 5% on an adjusted   1    basis, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency, primarily due to a continued decline in the Document Technology segment as well as a modest decline in the Services segment. 
     
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  33 

Supplies, paper and other sales   of $463 million includes unbundled supplies and other sales, primarily within our Document Technology segment. The 4% decline in these revenues included a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency, reduced supplies demand as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods and lower OEM supplies sales.  
                
    Financing revenue     is generated from financed equipment sale transactions primarily within the Document Technology segment. The 2% decline in these revenues reflected a declining finance receivables balance due to lower equipment sales in prior periods. 
                
    Equipment sales revenue     is reported primarily within our Document Technology segment and the Document Outsourcing business within our Services segment.     Equipment sales revenue decreased 8% as compared to   third   quarter   2015  , with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The decline was driven by fewer     large-account sales in North America, lower OEM sales as well as overall price declines that continue to be within our historical range of 5% to 10%. These areas of decline were partially offset by modest growth in developing markets. 
       
  Total revenue   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased 4% as compared to the prior period. On an adjusted   1    basis, excluding the third quarter 2015 HE charge, total revenues decreased 5%, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. On a revenue-weighted basis, our major European currencies and the Canadian Dollar were approximately 3% weaker against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year. Revenues from these major foreign currencies comprise approximately 25% of our total consolidated revenues (revenues from the Pound Sterling represent approximately 5% of the total), while overall non-U.S. revenues represent almost one third of the total. Total revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the following: 
             
    Annuity revenue   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased 3% as compared to the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, annuity revenue decreased 4%, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. Annuity revenue is comprised of the following: 
                
    Outsourcing, maintenance and rentals revenue   of $9,388 million includes outsourcing revenue within our Services segment and maintenance revenue (including bundled supplies) and rental revenue, both primarily within our Document Technology segment and declined 3% as compared to the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, these revenues decreased 4% with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency, primarily due to a continued decline in the Document Technology segment as well as a modest decline in the Services segment. 
                
    Supplies, paper and other sales   of $1,394 million includes unbundled supplies and other sales, primarily within our Document Technology segment. The 6% decline in these revenues included a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency, reduced supplies demand as a result of lower equipment sales in prior periods, continued weakness in developing markets and lower OEM supplies sales.  
                
    Financing revenue     is generated from financed equipment sale transactions primarily within the Document Technology segment. The 5% decline in these revenues reflected a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency and a declining finance receivables balance due to lower equipment sales in prior periods. 
                
    Equipment sales revenue     is reported primarily within our Document Technology segment and the Document Outsourcing (DO) business within our Services segment.     Equipment sales revenue decreased 8% as compared to the prior year period, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The decline was driven by lower developing market sales, fewer large account sales in North America, lower OEM sales and overall price declines that continue to be within our historical range of 5% to 10%.  
       
  Additional analysis of the change in revenue for each business segment is included in the  Segment Review  section.

Costs, Expenses and Other Income  
  Summary of Key Financial Ratios 
  The following is a summary of key financial ratios used to assess our performance:   

______________ 
  (1) Refer to the Operating Income/Margin and the Key Financial Ratios reconciliation tables in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. 
  Pre-tax Income Margin 
  Third   quarter 2016 pre-tax income margin of 3.6% increased 7.6-percentage points as compared to   third   quarter 
  2015. The increase was primarily driven by the   third   quarter 2015 HE charge of $389 million partially offset by higher 2016 restructuring and related costs as well as separation costs. 
  Pre-tax income margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of 2.2% increased 1.4-percentage points as compared to prior year. The increase was primarily driven by   third   quarter 2015 HE charge of $389 million partially offset by higher 2016 restructuring and related costs as well as separation costs. In addition, an increase in non-service retirement related costs of $30 million, due primarily to the $22 million curtailment gain recorded in the second quarter 2015, also partially offset the increase in pre-tax margin. 
  Pre-tax income margin includes the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, separation 
  costs and other expenses, net, all of which are separately discussed in subsequent sections. Pre-tax income 
  margin also includes non-service retirement related costs, which increased by $4 million and $30 million, respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Operating margin, discussed below, excludes all of these items. 
  Additional analysis on changes in restructuring and related costs, amortization of intangible assets, separation costs and other expenses, net are included in subsequent sections. 
  Operating Margin 
  Third   quarter 2016 operating margin   1    of 9.2% decreased 0.2-percentage points as compared to   third   quarter   2015  . Benefits from strategic transformation cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by increased expense, particularly in SAG, due to favorable prior-year compensation and benefit adjustments as well as the decline in total company revenue.  
  Operating margin   1    for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of 8.6% decreased 0.2-percentage points as compared to the prior year period. Benefits from strategic transformation cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by increased expense, particularly in SAG, due to favorable prior-year compensation and benefit adjustments as well as the decline in total company revenue.

  Third   quarter 2016 gross margin of 31.0% increased 8.2-percentage points as compared to   third   quarter 2015. On an adjusted   1    basis, gross margin of 31.3% increased by 0.1-percentage point. Services and Document Technology gross margin each improved year-over-year driven by cost and productivity improvements. These improvements were partially offset by the higher proportion of our revenue from Services (which historically has a lower gross margin). 
  Gross Margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of 30.7% increased 2.3-percentage points as compared to the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, gross margin of 31.0% decreased by 0.3-percentage points. Services and Document Technology gross margin each improved year-over-year driven by cost and productivity improvements. These improvements were partially offset by the higher proportion of our revenue from Services (which historically has a lower gross margin).  
  Additional analysis of the change in gross margin for each business segment is included in the "Segment Review" section.  
  Research, Development and Engineering Expenses (RD E) 

Third   quarter 2016 RD E as a percentage of revenue of 3.0% decreased 0.1-percentage point from   third   quarter 2015. On an adjusted   1    basis, RD E was 2.8% of revenue and decreased 0.1-percentage point due to restructuring savings and a higher mix of Services revenue (which historically has lower RD E as a percentage of revenue). 
  RD E of $126 million decreased by $9 million compared to   third   quarter 2015. On an adjusted   1    basis, RD E of $119 million decreased by $10 million.  
  RD E as a percentage of revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of 3.0% decreased 0.1-percentage points from the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, RD E was 2.8% of revenue and decreased 0.2-percentage points due to restructuring savings and a higher mix of Services revenue (which historically has lower RD E as a percentage of revenue). 
  RD E of $388 million decreased by $30 million compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . On an adjusted   1    basis, RD E of $367 million decreased by $37 million. We strategically coordinate R D with Fuji Xerox. 
  Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG) 
  SAG as a percentage of revenue of 19.6% decreased 0.1-percentage point from   third   quarter 2015. On an adjusted   1    basis, SAG was 19.3% of revenue and increased 0.4-percentage points. Restructuring and productivity improvements and a higher mix of Services revenue (which historically has lower SAG as a percentage of revenue) were more than offset by higher compensation and benefit expense and the decline in total company revenue. 
  SAG of $827 million was $28 million lower than   third   quarter 2015. On an adjusted   1    basis, SAG of $813 million decreased $28 million, including a $15 million favorable impact from currency, and reflected the following: 
             
    $33     million decrease in selling expenses. 
                
    $4 million increase in general and administrative expenses.  
                
    $1 million increase in bad debt expense.   Third   quarter 2016 bad debt expense remained at less than one percent of receivables. 
     SAG as a percentage of revenue for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of 20.0% was flat from the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, SAG was 19.6% of revenue and increased 0.1-percentage point from the prior year period. Restructuring and productivity improvements, a higher mix of Services revenue (which historically has lower SAG as a percentage of revenue), and lower bad debt expense was offset by higher compensation and benefit expense and an overall decline in total company revenue.

SAG of $2,571 million for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $105 million lower than the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, SAG of $2,522 million decreased $116 million, including a $42 million favorable impact from currency, and reflected the following: 
             
    $76     million decrease in selling expenses. 
                
    $31 million decrease in general and administrative expenses.  
                
    $9 million decrease in bad debt expense.  
       
  Restructuring and Related Costs  
  During   third   quarter 2016, Restructuring and related costs of $32 million include restructuring and asset impairment charges of $13 million as well as $19 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the Strategic Transformation program. 
  Third   quarter 2016 net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $13 million included $21 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 550 employees worldwide. Approximately 75% of the charges were related to our Document Technology segment and 25% to our Services segment. The third quarter 2016 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 40% of the costs focused on gross margin improvements and approximately 50% on SAG reductions, with the remainder focused on RD E optimization. These costs were partially offset by $8 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   Restructuring and related costs of $229 million included restructuring and asset impairment charges of $199 million as well as $30 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the Strategic Transformation program. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $199 million, which included $218 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 5,700 employees worldwide, $4 million of lease cancellation costs and $2 million of asset impairments. These costs were partially offset by $20 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives as well as a $5 million gain from the sale of real estate impaired in prior periods. 
  Approximately two-thirds of the 2016 charges related to our Document Technology segment, and about a third to our Services segment. 2016 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately half of the costs focused on gross margin improvements and approximately 40% on SAG reductions, with the remainder focused on RD E optimization. 
  During   third   quarter   2015  , we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $20 million, which included approximately $16 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 780 employees primarily related to our Services segment, $1 million of lease cancellation costs and $7 million of asset impairments which were primarily related to a surplus Canadian facility. These costs were partially offset by $4 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.  
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $191 million. Net restructuring charges of $38 million included $54 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 1,780 employees worldwide and $4 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $20 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. Asset impairment charges of $153 million included $146 million recorded in the second quarter 2015 associated with software asset impairments resulting from a change in our Government Healthcare Solutions strategy in the Services segment as well as $7 million of charges incurred in the third quarter 2015. See   Services   section within "Segment Review" for further discussion. 
  The restructuring reserve balance as of   September 30, 2016   for all programs was $103 million, of which $98 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months. 
  We continue to expect restructuring and related costs of approximately $300 million for full-year 2016. 
  Refer to Note 9 - Restructuring Programs, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.

Separation costs 
  Separation costs are primarily for third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar 
  types of services related to the separation transaction as well as costs associated with the operational separation of 
  the two companies, such as those related to human resources, brand management, real estate and information management to the extent not capitalized  .   Separation costs also include the costs associated with bonuses and restricted stock grants awarded to employees for retention through the separation.  
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded separation costs of $39 million and $75 million, respectively. For full-year 2016, we continue to expect to incur separation costs of approximately $175 to $200 million, which exclude tax-related separation costs discussed below in   Income Taxes  . We also continue to anticipate separation-related capital spending of approximately $50 million for full-year 2016. 
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
  Amortization of intangible assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of $244 million increased $11 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the impairment of a customer relationship asset resulting from a lost contract. 
  Worldwide Employment 
  Worldwide employment was approximately   131,800   as of   September 30, 2016   and decreased by   11,800   from   December 31, 2015  , due primarily to the impact of restructuring and productivity-related reductions as well as seasonal reductions. 
  Other Expenses, Net 

_______________ 
   (1)    Excludes the loss on sale of the ITO business reported in Discontinued Operations. 
  Note: Total Other Expenses, Net with the exception of Deferred compensation investment (gains) losses are included in the Other segment. Deferred compensation investment (gains) losses are included in the Services segment together with the related deferred compensation expense/income.  
  Non-Financing Interest Expense:   Non-financing interest expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   of $49 million and $153 million, respectively, was $6 million and $14 million, respectively, lower than the prior year comparable periods. When combined with financing interest expense (cost of financing), total company interest expense declined by $7 million and $15 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable period, driven by a lower average cost of debt, primarily due to a lower rate on our one-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured term facility, and a lower debt balance.  
  Deferred Compensation Investment 
  Deferred compensation investment gains for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were $7 million and $6 million higher, respectively, than the prior year comparable periods due to the performance of the underlying investments. 
  Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets:   The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 include gains on the sale of surplus technology assets of $17 million and $14 million, respectively.

Litigation Matters:   The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 litigation matters reflect probable losses and reserves for various legal matters. 
  Income Taxes 
  Third   quarter 2016 effective tax rate was 3.3%. On an adjusted   1    basis,   third   quarter 2016 tax rate was 25.3%. Both rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign tax credits resulting from anticipated dividends from our foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate of 3.3% also included tax-related separation costs, which are discussed below. 
  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was (0.4%). On an adjusted   1    basis, the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   tax rate was 21.7%. Both rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign tax credits resulting from anticipated dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, the redetermination of certain unrecognized tax positions upon conclusion of several audits, and the geographical mix of profits. The effective tax rate of (0.4%) also included tax-related separation costs, which are discussed below. 
  Third   quarter 2015 effective tax rate was 60.7% which was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to 
  the discrete tax benefit associated with the HE charge. On an adjusted1 basis, third quarter 2015 tax rate was 
  27.1%, which was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign tax credits resulting from anticipated 
  dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, the geographical mix of profits and the reversal of a deferred tax valuation 
  allowance, partially offset by additions to unrecognized tax positions.  
  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was (73.5%) and was negative primarily due to the discrete tax benefit associated with the HE charge and the second quarter 2015 software impairment charges. On an adjusted   1    basis, the nine months ended September 30, 2015 tax rate was 26.1%, which was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign tax credits resulting from anticipated dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, the geographical mix of profits and the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance, partially offset by additions to unrecognized tax positions. 
  Xerox operations are widely dispersed. The statutory tax rate in most non-U.S. jurisdictions is lower than the combined U.S. and state tax rate. The amount of income subject to these lower foreign rates relative to the amount of U.S. income will impact our effective tax rate. However, no one country outside of the U.S. is a significant factor to our overall effective tax rate. Certain foreign income is subject to U.S. tax net of any available foreign tax credits. Our estimated full year effective tax rate includes a benefit of approximately 20-percentage points from these non-U.S. operations, which is a result of our current geographical mix of pre-tax income adjusted for any available foreign tax credit benefits.  
  Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign 
  income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not 
  be predictable. Excluding the effects of intangibles amortization, restructuring and related costs, non-service 
  retirement related costs, separation costs and other discrete items, we anticipate that our adjusted1 effective tax 
  rate will be approximately 25% to 27% for fourth quarter 2016 and approximately 23% to 25% for full year 
  2016. 
  Tax-related Separation Costs 
  We recorded a deferred tax benefit/asset of $15 million related to our separation costs for third quarter 2016 and $29 million for the 2016 year-to-date period. We estimate half of the year-to-date deferred tax asset will be eliminated at the time the separation is executed, as certain separation costs are expected to be non-deductible. 
  In connection with the actual legal separation of the company, we expect to effect certain internal reorganizations of, 
  and transactions among, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and operating activities in preparation for the legal form of 
  separation. Although we believe that, for the most part, this reorganization of entities can be completed in a tax-free 
  manner, we do expect to incur incremental income tax expense associated with certain elements of the 
  reorganization. Accordingly, for year-to-date 2016, we recorded $24 million, including a $2 million credit in third quarter 2016, for the estimated income tax on the book/tax basis differences currently associated with our investments in certain subsidiaries that are expected to be impacted by these internal reorganizations. Upon final separation of the company, we also expect to recognize additional income tax expense in certain state and international jurisdictions primarily related to the change in realizability of certain deferred tax assets. At present, we estimate that this additional income tax expense will be approximately $15 to $25 million, for a total of approximately $40 to $50 million for full-year 2016.

Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates  

Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox net income. The decrease in equity income of $1 million and $5 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, is primarily due to our share of Fuji Xerox's lower net income, partially offset by translation currency impacts.  
  Net Income from Continuing Operations 
  Third   quarter 2016 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $181 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. On an adjusted   1    basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $286 million, or $0.27 per diluted share.   Third   quarter 2016 adjustments to net income include the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and separation costs. 
  Third   quarter 2015 net loss from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $31 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. On an adjusted   1    basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $289 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. Third quarter 2015 adjustments to net income include the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, the HE charge and non-service retirement-related costs. 
  Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $370 million or $0.34 per diluted share. On an adjusted   1    basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $828 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, and reflects the adjustments for the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs, and separation costs. 
  Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $267 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. On an adjusted   1    basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $831 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, and reflects the adjustments for the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, the HE charge and non-service retirement-related costs.

     Discontinued Operations  
  Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO): 
  In fourth quarter 2014, we announced an agreement to sell the ITO business to Atos and began reporting it as a Discontinued Operation. All prior periods were accordingly revised to conform to this presentation. The sale was completed on June 30, 2015. There were no Discontinued Operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Refer to Note 4 - Divestitures, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.   
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Third   quarter 2016 net income attributable to Xerox was   $181 million  , or   $0.17   per diluted share.   Third   quarter 2015 net loss attributable to Xerox was   $34 million  , or   $0.04   per diluted share. 
  Net income attributable to Xerox for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $370 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. Net income attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $203 million, or $0.17 per diluted share.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  Third   quarter 2016 Other comprehensive loss attributable to Xerox was $  46   million as compared to a loss of   $100   million in the   third   quarter 2015. The decreased loss is primarily due to a $184 million reduction in losses from the translation of our foreign currency denominated net assets. The third quarter 2016 reflects translation losses of $22 as compared to translation losses of $206 million in the third quarter 2015.  The third quarter 2015 loss primarily reflected the weakening of the Pound Sterling and Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.  Partially offsetting the reduction in translation losses was a $112 million increased loss from changes in defined benefit plans from a gain of   $97 million   in the   third   quarter 2015 to a loss of   $15 million   in the   third   quarter 2016. The third quarter 2016 change in benefit plans was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by currency adjustments on accumulated defined benefit plan losses.  
  Other Comprehensive income attributable to Xerox for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $10 million as compared to a loss of $240 million in the prior year period. The change of $250 million, is primarily due to a $613 million change from the translation of our foreign currency denominated net assets. The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects translation gains of $92 million primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, Euro and Canadian Dollar as compared to the U.S. Dollar as the Pound Sterling weakened year-to-date 2016. The   nine months ended September 30, 2015   reflects translation losses of $521 million primarily due to a significant weakening across all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Offsetting the change in translation were net losses from changes in defined benefit plans of $107 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to net gains of $262 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The benefit plan losses in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were primarily due to a decrease in discount rates.  
  Refer to Note 11 - Financial Instruments, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding foreign currency derivatives, and Note 13 - Employee Benefit Plans, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding net changes in our defined benefit plans and related losses and gains. 
   
  Segment Review 
  In first quarter 2016, we revised our segment reporting to reflect the following changes: 
             
    The transfer of the Education/Student Loan business from the Services segment to Other as a result of the expected continued run-off of this business. The business does not meet the threshold for separate segment reporting. 
                
    The exclusion of the non-service elements of our defined-benefit pension and retiree-health plan costs from Segment profit. 
     Prior year amounts were revised accordingly to reflect these changes.

  Third   quarter 2016 Services revenue of   $2,398 million   was 57% of total revenue and increased   1%   from   third   quarter 
  2015.  On an adjusted   1    basis, Services revenue decreased 3%, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency.    
             
    BPO revenue increased 3% from   third   quarter 2015 and represented 67% of total Services revenue. On an adjusted   1    basis, BPO revenue decreased 4% with minimal currency impact. The decline was driven by lower volumes and lost business, as well as overall price declines that were consistent with prior periods. These areas of decline were partially offset by ramping new contracts and modest growth from acquisitions. 
                
    In   third   quarter 2016, BPO revenue mix across the major business areas was as follows: Commercial Industries (excluding healthcare) - 44%; Healthcare - 24%; Public Sector - 28%; and all other (including our HE Medicaid platform implementations) - 4%. 
                
    DO revenue decreased   1%  , with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency, and represented 33% of Services revenue. Growth at constant currency was driven primarily from our partner print services offerings, which more than offset the impact of lower new business signings and price declines on renewals. 
       
  Services revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of $7,350 million was 57% of total revenue and  
  
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  42 

relatively flat from the prior year period. On an adjusted   1    basis, Services revenue decreased 2%, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. 
             
    BPO revenue was relatively flat as compared to the prior year period and represented 67% of total Services revenue. On an adjusted   1    basis, BPO revenue decreased 3% with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The decline was driven by lower volumes and lost business, as well as overall price declines that were consistent with prior periods. These areas of decline were partially offset by ramping new contracts and modest growth from acquisitions, particularly in Healthcare.  
                
    BPO revenue mix for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   across the major business areas was as follows: Commercial Industries (excluding healthcare) - 44%; Healthcare - 26%; Public Sector - 26%; and all other (including our HE Medicaid platform implementations) - 4%. 
                
    DO revenue was relatively flat, with a 3-percentage point negative impact from currency, and represented 33% of Services revenue. Growth at constant currency was driven primarily from our partner print services offerings and equipment sales, which more than offset the impact of lower new business signings and price declines on renewals. 
       
  Segment Margin 
  Third   quarter 2016 Services segment margin of   9.4%   increased by 17.7-percentage points, or 1.6-percentage points on an adjusted   1    basis, from   third   quarter 2015, including a 0.9-percentage point increase in gross margin. The increase reflected restructuring and productivity improvements, particularly in BPO, which more than offset price declines, as well as anticipated year-over-year benefits from lower expenses associated with our HE platform implementations and a higher proportion of DO revenue (which historically has higher segment margin). These benefits were partially offset by continuing margin pressures in our customer care offering as well as higher compensation and benefit expense.  
  Services segment margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   8.9%   increased by 6.6-percentage points, or 1.4 points on an adjusted   1    basis, from the prior year period, including a 0.9-percentage point increase in gross margin. The increase reflected restructuring and productivity improvements, particularly in BPO, which more than offset price declines, as well as anticipated year-over-year benefits from lower expenses associated with our HE platform implementations and a higher proportion of DO revenue (which historically has higher segment margin). These benefits were partially offset by continuing margin pressures in our customer care offering as well as higher compensation and benefit expense.  
  BPO margin does not reflect the impact of our student loan business, which is included in Other. 
  As disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report, the fair value of the Commercial Services reporting unit (which has approximately $2.0 billion of goodwill) exceeded its carrying value by approximately 17%.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, revenues and operating profits for our Commercial Services reporting unit decreased by 7% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Although we continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and cost improvements in this business; depending on the duration of this trend and our ability to manage through it, there is a possibility that certain assumptions and estimates, including cash flow projections, used for the upcoming fourth quarter 2016 annual goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit could be unfavorably impacted. The Company intends to complete its goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during the fourth quarter 2016.

  Our HE platform is performing to contractual standards in the states where it has been fully implemented, which 
  include New Hampshire, Alaska and North Dakota. New Hampshire was certified by the Center for Medicare and 
  Medicaid Services in June 2015, and we are currently in the process of getting our Alaska HE implementation 
  certified and in the planning phase of North Dakota certification. We continue to strengthen and improve our 
  platform development and systems integration capabilities with additional resources and enhanced program 
  management and quality control practices.  
  Due to a number of factors, development work to implement the HE platform in New York has been elongated 
  beyond the current contractual schedule resulting in, among other things, increased delivery costs, which we have 
  considered in our estimates of revenues and costs under the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. 
  We continue to work with New York to address new regulatory requirements, policy changes and enhanced security 
  protocols, which are expected to further lengthen the schedule and may result in material increases in future costs

to complete. We are seeking to mitigate these impacts through a combination of operational actions as well as by 
  working with New York to pursue an amendment to the contract that will revise the project schedule and increase

  Signings:     Signings are defined as estimated future revenues from contracts signed during the period, including renewals of existing contracts.   Third   quarter 2016 Services signings were $2.2 billion in Total Contract Value (TCV). 
  Signings were as follows:    

  Signings increased 15% from   third   quarter 2015, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency, primarily reflecting higher contribution from renewals. On a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis, signings increased 6% at constant currency from the comparable prior year period. New business TCV at constant currency decreased 15% from third quarter 2015 and decreased 9% on a TTM basis; these declines reflect, in part, our decision to not pursue opportunities with lower margin and return profiles. DO signings do not include signings from our growing partner print services offerings.  
  Note: TCV is the estimated total contractual revenue related to signed contracts. 
  Renewal Rate (Total Services)  :   Renewal rate is defined as the annual recurring revenue (ARR) on contracts that are renewed during the period as a percentage of ARR on all contracts for which a renewal decision was made during the period. The combined   third   quarter 2016 contract renewal rate for BPO and DO contracts was 86%, within our target range of 85%-90%. The year-to-date renewal rate was 85%.  
    
  Document Technology  
  Our Document Technology segment includes the sale of products and supplies, as well as the associated maintenance and financing of those products. 
  Revenue 

_______________ 
  CC - See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section for description of Constant Currency 
  Third   quarter 2016 Document Technology revenue of $  1,626 million   decreased   9%   from   third   quarter 2015, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Document Technology revenues exclude Document Outsourcing. Inclusive of Document Outsourcing,   third   quarter 2016 aggregate document-related revenue decreased 6% from   third   quarter 2015, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. Document Technology segment revenue results included the following:  
             
    Equipment sales revenue   declined   14%   from   third   quarter 2015, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The decline was driven by fewer large-account sales in North America, lower OEM sales and continued migration of customers to our partner print services offering (included in our Services segment) as well as overall price declines that continue to be within our historical range of 5 to 10%. These declines were partially offset by moderate benefits from improved sales in our high-end color category following the drupa trade show.

Annuity revenue   decreased by   6%   from   third   quarter 2015, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The annuity revenue reduction reflects lower equipment sales in prior periods, ongoing page declines and lower supplies demand, as well as the continued migration of customers to our partner print services offering (included in our Services segment).  
       
  Document Technology revenue mix was 57% mid-range, 24% high-end and 19% entry, consistent with recent quarters. 
    
  Document Technology revenue of   $5,017 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   9%     from the prior year period, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Document Technology revenues exclude Document Outsourcing. Inclusive of Document Outsourcing, aggregate document-related revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased 6% from the prior year period, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. Document Technology segment revenue results included the following:  
             
    Equipment sales revenue   declined   12%   from the prior year period, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The decline was driven by continued weakness in developing markets, fewer large account sales in North America, continued migration of customers to our partner print services offering (included in our Services segment) and overall price declines that continue to be within our historical range of 5 to 10%. These declines were partially offset by moderate benefits from recent product launches primarily in our mid-range category and from improved sales in our high-end color category following the drupa trade show. 
                
    Annuity revenue   decreased by   7%   from the prior year period, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The annuity revenue reduction reflects lower equipment sales in prior periods, ongoing page declines and lower supplies demand, as well as the continued migration of customers to our partner print services offering (included in our Services segment). These areas of decline were partially offset by annuity growth in our high-end color product group. 
       
  Document Technology revenue mix was 57% mid-range, 24% high-end and 19% entry, consistent with recent quarters. 
  Total revenue in the Document Technology segment is expected to continue to decline over the next three years as we continue to migrate the business to more services-based offerings. These services-based offerings are reported within our Services segment as part of our Document Outsourcing business. This segment also continues to be impacted by lower equipment placements and price declines as well as related supplies and page declines. We expect to continue to mitigate these declines through our focus on productivity and cost improvements, as well as investments in growth areas of the market. 
  Segment Margin 
  Third   quarter 2016 Document Technology segment margin of   13.1%   declined 0.8-percentage points from   third   quarter 2015, but included a 0.9-percentage point improvement in gross margin. The gross margin increase reflects restructuring and productivity improvements only partially offset by price declines. SAG increased as a percent of revenue primarily due to prior-year compensation and benefit expense adjustments and a decline in segment revenues. 
  Document Technology segment margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   12.0%   declined 1.0-percentage points from the prior year period, including a 0.1-percentage point improvement in gross margin. The gross margin increase reflects restructuring and productivity improvements only partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and price declines. SAG increased as a percent of revenue, primarily due to prior-year compensation and benefit expense adjustments as well as a decline in segment revenue which was only partially matched by productivity improvements.

     Other 
  Revenue 
  Third   quarter 2016 Other revenue of   $188 million   was flat from third quarter 2015, with a 1-percentage point negative impact from currency. The anticipated run-off of the Student Loan business, now reported in Other, and 
  lower wide-format revenues were offset by higher paper and network integration-related solution sales. Total paper 
  revenue (all within developing markets) and the Student Loan business combined comprise nearly half of Other 
  revenue. 
  Other revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $511 million   decreased 6% from the prior year period, with a 2-percentage point negative impact from currency. The anticipated run-off of the Student Loan business, now reported in Other, and lower wide-format revenues, were offset by higher paper and network integration-related solution sales. Total paper revenue (all within developing markets) and the Student Loan business combined comprise approximately half of Other revenue. 
    
  Other Loss

Third   quarter 2016 Other loss of $65 million increased $10 million from   third   quarter 2015. Other expenses, net (excluding Deferred compensation investment gains) are reported within Other and were $58 million in   third   quarter 2016 as compared to $68 million in   third   quarter 2015. The $10 million reduction was primarily due to a decline in non-financing interest expense. Remaining Other loss of $7 million in   third   quarter 2016 increased $20 million from   third   quarter 2015 income of $13 million, primarily related to lower profitability in the Student Loan business.  
    
  Other loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of $211 million increased $47 million from the prior year period. Other expenses, net (excluding Deferred compensation investment gains) are reported within Other and were $173 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to $186 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The $13 million reduction was primarily due to a decline in non-financing interest expense. Remaining Other loss of $38 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased $60 million from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   income of $22, primarily related to lower profitability in the Student Loan business.  

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total cash and cash equivalents were   $1,423   million and   $1,368   million, respectively.  There were no borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, or letters of credit under our $2 billion Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016     or   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We continue to expect cash flows from operations will be between $950 million and $1.2 billion in 2016. 
  Cash Flow Analysis 
  The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents: 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $522   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The $211 million decrease in operating cash from the prior year period was primarily due to the following: 
             
    $105 million decrease in pre-tax income before depreciation and amortization, gains on sales of businesses and assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related costs, curtailment gain, separation-related costs and the prior year HE charge. 
                
    $211 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued compensation primarily related to a reduction in days payable outstanding and higher foreign currency denominated payments. 
                
    $115 million decrease reflecting settlement payments associated with our third quarter 2015 decision to not fully complete the HE implementations in California and Montana. 
                
    $67 million decrease from accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections. 
                
    $54 million decrease from higher restructuring and related payments. 
                
    $39 million decrease due to the prior year source of cash in the discontinued ITO business. 
                
    $32 million decrease due to payments for separation-related costs. 
                
    $150 million increase primarily due to lower inventory requirements as well as lower levels of in transit inventory. 
                
    $73 million increase from finance receivables primarily related to a higher level of run-off due to lower originations and to a reduced impact from 2012 and 2013 finance receivables sales. 
                
    $63 million increase from the settlements of foreign currency derivative contracts. This increase primarily offsets the negative currency impacts on our Yen-denominated inventory purchases as well as other foreign currency denominated payments recorded in inventory and accounts payable. 
                
    $42 million increase due to lower pension contributions. 
                
    $17 million increase due to lower income tax payments. 
     
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  47 

$14 million increase from lower spending for product software and up-front costs. 
       
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $261   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The $788 million decrease in cash from the prior year period was primarily due to the following: 
             
    $992 million decrease primarily due to a $52 million payment to Atos in 2016, reflecting final working capital adjustments associated with the 2015 ITO divestiture, compared to $930 million of net proceeds from the sale of the ITO business in 2015. 
                 
    $44 million increase due to lower capital expenditures (including internal use software) primarily due to the sale of the ITO business. 
       
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $213   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The $1,583 million increase in cash from the prior year period was primarily due to the following:  
              
    $212 million increase from net debt activity.  2016 reflects net proceeds of $1 billion from a Senior Unsecured Term Facility offset by payments of $700 million on Senior Notes and $250 million on Notes.  2015 reflects payment of $1,250 million on Senior Notes offset by net proceeds of $1,045 million from the issuance of Senior Notes and an increase of $50 million in Commercial Paper. 
                
    $44 million increase from lower distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
                
    $33 million increase due to the absence of a stock-based award vesting in 2016. 
       
  Customer Financing Activities and Debt 
  The following represents our total finance assets, net associated with our lease and finance operations:

    Reflects the adoption of   ASU 2015-03  , Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs effective January 1, 2016, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability. Prior year amounts were revised to reflect the new presentation. 
              (3) 
    Fair value adjustments include the following - (i) fair value adjustments to debt associated with terminated interest rate swaps, which are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the related notes; and (ii) changes in fair value of hedged debt obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates. Hedge accounting requires hedged debt instruments to be reported inclusive of any fair value adjustment.

Refer to Note 10 - Debt, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  
  Our lease contracts permit customers to pay for equipment over time rather than at the date of installation; therefore, we maintain a certain level of debt (that we refer to as financing debt) to support our investment in these lease contracts, which are reflected in total finance assets, net. For this financing aspect of our business, we maintain an assumed 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared to our finance assets.  
  Based on this leverage, the following represents the breakdown of total debt between financing debt and core debt: 

____________________________ 
           (1) 
    Financing debt includes   $3,356   million and   $3,490   million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of debt associated with total finance receivables, net and is the basis for our calculation of  Equipment financing interest  expense. The remainder of the financing debt is associated with Equipment on operating leases.

  Liquidity and Financial Flexibility 
  We manage our worldwide liquidity using internal cash management practices, which are subject to (1) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate, (2) the legal requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and (3) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services. 
    
  Our principal debt maturities are in line with historical and projected cash flows and are spread over the next ten years as follows:

Financial Risk Management 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge economic exposures, as well as to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. We enter into limited types of derivative contracts, including interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency spot, forward and swap contracts and net purchased foreign currency options to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Our primary foreign currency market exposures include the Yen, Euro and Pound Sterling. The fair market values of all our derivative contracts change with fluctuations in interest rates and/or currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes. 
  We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet.  As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities. 
  By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties. 
  The current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. Refer to Note 11   Financial Instruments, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and information on our financial risk management strategies. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects. 
  These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are set forth on the following tables.  These reconciliations also include the income tax effects for our non-GAAP performance measures in total, to the extent applicable. The income tax effects are calculated under the same accounting principles as applied to our reported pre-tax performance measures under ASC 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method. The noted income tax effect for our non-GAAP performance measures is effectively the difference in income taxes for reported and adjusted pre-tax income calculated under the annual effective tax rate method. 
  NOTE:   In 2016 we revised our calculation of Adjusted Earnings Measures to exclude the following items in addition 
  to the amortization of intangibles: 
             
    Restructuring and related costs including those related to Fuji Xerox. 
                
    The non-service related elements of our defined benefit pension and retiree health plan costs (retirement-related). 
                
    Separation costs 
     
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  50 

Prior year amounts were revised accordingly to reflect these changes. 
  Adjusted Revenue, Costs and Expenses, and Margin 
  As previously discussed, during third quarter 2015 we recorded a pre-tax charge (HE charge) of $389 million, which included a $116 million reduction to revenues. (See   Services   within the "Segment Review" section for additional details). As a result of the significant impact of the HE charge on our reported revenues, costs and expenses as well as key metrics for the prior year period, we also discussed our results using non-GAAP measures which exclude the impact of the HE charge. In addition to the magnitude of the charge and its impact on our prior-year reported results, we excluded the HE charge due to the fact that it was primarily a unique charge associated with the conclusion, reached after a series of discussions, that fully completing our HE platform implementations in California and Montana was no longer considered probable. This adjustment was in addition to the adjustments noted below. 
  Adjusted Earnings Measures 
             
    Net income and Earnings per share (EPS) 
                
    Effective tax rate 
                
    Gross margin, RD E and SAG (adjusted for non-service retirement-related costs only) 
     The above measures were adjusted for the following items: 
  Amortization of intangible assets:    
  The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.  
  Restructuring and related costs:    
  Restructuring and related costs include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our Strategic Transformation program beyond those normally included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our Strategic Transformation program are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance. 
  Non-service retirement-related costs:    
  Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (iv) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. Adjusted earnings will continue to include the elements of our retirement costs related to current employee service (service cost and amortization of prior service cost) as well as the cost of our defined contribution plans.  
  Separation costs:    
  Separation costs are expenses incurred in connection with Xerox's planned separation into two independent, publicly traded companies. Separation costs are primarily for third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services related to the separation transaction as well as costs associated with the operational separation of the two companies, such as those related to human resources, brand management, real estate and information management to the extent not capitalized. Separation costs also include the costs associated with bonuses and restricted stock grants awarded to employees for retention through the separation as well as incremental income tax expense related to the reorganization of legal entities and operations in order to effect the  
  
   Xerox 2016 Form 10-Q 
  51 

legal separation of the Company. These costs are incremental to normal operating charges and are being incurred solely as a result of the separation transaction. Accordingly, we are excluding these expenses from our Adjusted Earnings Measures in order to evaluate our performance on a comparable basis. 
  Operating Income and Margin 
  We also calculate and utilize operating income and margin earnings measures by adjusting our pre-tax income and margin amounts to exclude certain items. In addition to the costs noted for our Adjusted Earnings measures, operating income and margin also exclude other expenses, net. Other expenses, net is primarily comprised of non-financing interest expense and also includes certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business.

  Refer to "Currency Impact" for a discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth.  
  Summary 
  Management believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods  results against the corresponding prior periods  results. However, the following non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. 
  A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth on the following tables:

ARTICLE I 
    
  MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
    
  SECTION 1.      Annual Meetings  :  A meeting of shareholders entitled to vote shall be held for the election of Directors and the transaction of other business each year in such month and on such day (except a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday) as determined by the Board of Directors. 
    
  SECTION 2.      Special Meetings  :  Special Meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors. 
    
  SECTION 3.      Place of Meetings  :  Meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such other place, within or without the State of New York, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. 
    
  SECTION 4.      Notice of Meetings: 
    
  (a)    Notice of each meeting of shareholders shall be in writing and shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting. Notice of a Special Meeting shall state the purpose or purposes for which it is being called and shall also indicate that it is being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting. If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if taken, entitle shareholders, fulfilling the requirements of Section 623 of the Business Corporation Law to receive payment for their shares, the notice of such meeting shall include a statement of that purpose and to that effect. 
    
  (b)    A copy of the notice of any meeting shall be given, personally, electronically or by mail, not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the record of shareholders, or, if he or she shall have filed with the Secretary a written request that notices to him or her be mailed to some other address, then directed to him or her at such other address. 

1 

(c)    Notice of meeting need not be given to any shareholder who submits a signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy, whether before or after the meeting. The attendance of any shareholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy, without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice by him or her. 
       
  SECTION 5.      Quorum and Adjourned Meetings  : 
    
  (a)    At any Annual or Special Meeting the holders of a majority of the votes of shares entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, provided that when a specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class or series, voting as a class, the holders of a majority of the votes of shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such specified item of business. When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any shareholders. 
    
  (b)    Despite the absence of a quorum, the shareholders present may adjourn the meeting to another time and place, and it shall not be necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. If after the adjournment, however, the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder on the new record date entitled to notice under Section 4 of this Article I of the By-Laws. 
    
  SECTION 6.      Nominations and Business at Meetings: 
    
  At any annual meeting of shareholders, only persons who are nominated or business which is proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6 shall be eligible for election as Directors or considered for action by shareholders. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Company may be made or business proposed at a meeting of shareholders (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice and other procedures set forth in this Section 6. Such nominations or business proposals, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company and such business proposals must, under applicable law, be a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder s notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days in advance of the date which is the anniversary of the date the Company s proxy statement was released to security holders in connection with the previous year s annual meeting; provided, however, that with respect to the Company s annual meeting to be held during calendar year 2016, to be timely (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6), a shareholder s notice of nominations must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. EST on January 29, 2016; provided further, that, if the Company did not hold such previous year s annual meeting or if the anniversary date of the current year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year s annual meeting, then such shareholder s notice shall be so delivered or mailed and received within a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy statement.  

2 

Such shareholder s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom such shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and any material interest in such business of such person on whose behalf such proposal is made; and (c) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (i) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company s books and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by such shareholder. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Company and no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders unless nominated or proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6. The Chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination or proposal was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6 and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination or proposal shall be disregarded.  
    
  SECTION 7.      Organization  :  At every meeting of the shareholders, the Chairman of the Board, or in his or her absence, the Chief Executive Officer, or in his or her absence, the President, or in his or her absence, a person selected by a majority of the Directors present at the meeting, shall act as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, and in the absence of both the Secretary and an Assistant Secretary, a person selected by a majority of the Directors present at the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting.  
    
  SECTION 8.      Voting: 
    
  (a)    Whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall, except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation be authorized by a majority of the votes cast in favor of or against such action at a meeting of shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon. An abstention shall not constitute a vote cast. 
    
  (b)    In an uncontested election, any incumbent nominees for director who receives a greater number of votes cast against his or her election than in favor of his or her election shall tender his or her resignation promptly after such election. The independent Directors shall then decide, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board s explanation of its decision shall be promptly disclosed on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
    
  SECTION 9.      Qualification of Voters  : 
    
  (a)    Every shareholder of record of Common Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company shall be entitled at every meeting of such shareholders to one vote for every share of Common Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, standing in his or her name on the record of shareholders. 

3 

(b)    Shares of stock belonging to the Company and shares held by another domestic or foreign corporation of any type or kind, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the Company, shall not be shares entitled to vote or to be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares. 
    
  (c)    Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, committee, or other fiduciary, except a trustee, may be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, without transfer of such shares into his or her name.  Shares held by a trustee may be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, only after the shares have been transferred into his or her name as trustee or into the name of his or her nominee. 
    
  (d)    Shares standing in the name of another domestic or foreign corporation of any type or kind may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the By-Laws of such corporation may provide, or in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such corporation may provide. 
    
  SECTION 10.      Proxies  : 
    
  (a)    Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy. 
    
  (b)    No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the shareholder executing it, except as otherwise provided by law. 
    
  (c)    The authority of the holder of a proxy to act shall not be revoked by the incompetence or death of the shareholder who executed the proxy unless, before the authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of such incompetence or of such death is received by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. 
    
  (d)    Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may grant such authority: 
    
  (1)    A shareholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the shareholder or the shareholder s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature. 
    
  (2)    A shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be reasonably determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was  
  
   4 

authorized by the shareholder. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors shall specify the nature of the information upon which they relied. 
    
  (e)    Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile, telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 

SECTION 11.      Inspectors of Election  :  
    
  (a)    The Board of Directors, in advance of any shareholders  meeting, shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed, or if such persons are unable to act at a meeting of shareholders, the person presiding at a shareholders  meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. 
    
  (b)    The inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting or any shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them. Any report or certificate made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as certified by them. 
    
  SECTION 12.      List of Shareholders at Meetings  :  A list of shareholders as of the record date, certified by the Secretary or by the transfer agent, shall be produced at any meeting of shareholders upon the request thereat or prior thereto of any shareholder. If the right to vote at any meeting is challenged, the inspectors of election, or person presiding thereat shall require such list of shareholders to be produced as evidence of the right of the persons challenged to vote at such meeting, and all persons who appear from such list to be shareholders entitled to vote thereat may vote at such meeting. 
    
  ARTICLE II

  SECTION 1.      Power of Board and Qualification of Directors  : The business of the Company shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors, each of whom shall be at least eighteen years of age. 

5 

SECTION 2.      Number, Term of Office and Classification  : 
    
  (a)    The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than five nor more than twenty-one members.  The number of Directors shall be determined from time to time by resolution of a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office, provided that no decrease in the number of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. At each Annual Meeting of shareholders Directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting. 
    
  (b)    If and whenever six full quarter-yearly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Cumulative Preferred Stock of any series shall be in arrears, in whole or in part, the number of Directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional Directors at any annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon for the current quarter-yearly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the right of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock to elect such additional two Directors shall cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected as Directors by the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall forthwith terminate and the number of the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of any holder of the Cumulative Preferred Stock (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Company) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the election of the two Directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the By-Laws for a special meeting of the shareholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the Secretary within twenty days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Cumulative Preferred Stock may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Company. The Directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof. In case any vacancy shall occur among the Directors elected by the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, a successor shall be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof by the then remaining Director elected by the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or the successor of such remaining Director. 
    
  (c)    All Directors shall have equal voting power. 
    
  SECTION 3.      Organization  :  At each meeting of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, or in his or her absence, if the Chief Executive Officer is a Director, the Chief Executive Officer, or if the Chief Executive Officer is not a Director or in his or her absence, if the President is a Director, the President, or if the President is not a Director or in his or her absence, a chairman chosen by a majority of the Directors present at the meeting shall preside. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the Board of Directors. In the event the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the Board of Directors, a majority of the Directors present at the meeting shall select the secretary. 

6 

SECTION 4.      Resignations  : Any Director of the Company may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board or to the Secretary of the Company. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if no time be specified, then on delivery. 
    
  SECTION 5.      Vacancies:    Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of Directors and vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors for any reason except the removal of Directors without cause may be filled by a vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, although less than a quorum exists. A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual meeting. 
    
  SECTION 6.      Place of Meeting  : The Board of Directors may hold its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of New York as the Board of Directors may from time to time by resolution determine.

COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 
    
  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges, the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, as well as any deficiency of earnings are determined using the following applicable factors:  
  Earnings available for fixed charges     are calculated first, by determining the sum of: (a) income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity income; (b) distributed equity income; (c) fixed charges, as defined below; and (d) amortization of capitalized interest, if any. From this total, we subtract capitalized interest and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  
  Fixed charges     are calculated as the sum of: (a) interest costs (both expensed and capitalized); (b) amortization of debt expense and discount or premium relating to any indebtedness; and (c) that portion of rental expense that is representative of the interest factor.  
  Preferred stock dividends   used in the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of pre-tax earnings required to cover dividends paid on our Series A convertible preferred stock. 

____________ 
  * Earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were inadequate to cover fixed charges by $173 and fixed charges and preferred dividends by $183.
