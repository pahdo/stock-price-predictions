   Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  This report includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning and protections of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as  may,   will,   anticipate,   assume,   should,   indicate,   would,   believe,   contemplate,   expect,   estimate,   continue,   plan,   project,   could,   intend,   target  and other similar words and expressions of the future. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  

statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;     

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;     

statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and     

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.     
     
  These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of the management of Eagle Bancorp Montana, Inc. (the  Company  or  Eagle ) and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.  
     
  The following factors, among others, could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:  

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements;     

general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;     

competition among depository and other financial institutions;     

changes in the prices, values and sales volume of residential and commercial real estate in Montana;     

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;     

changes or volatility in the securities markets;     

our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;     

our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses;     

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;     

our ability to continue to increase and manage our commercial and residential real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans;     

possible impairments of securities held by us, including those issued by government entities and government sponsored enterprises;     

the level of future deposit premium assessments;     

the impact of a recurring recession on our loan portfolio (including cash flow and collateral values), investment portfolio, customers and capital market activities;     

the Company s ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable information technology systems, effectively defend itself against cyberattacks or recover from breaches to its cybersecurity infrastructure;     

the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of allowance for possible loan losses and other estimates;     

changes in the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers and their ability to repay their loans when due; and     

the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting standard setters.     
     
  Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. For a further list and description of various risks, relevant factors and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements, see the Item 1A,  Risk Factors  and Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  sections contained elsewhere in this report, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, any subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and other filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or correct any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur, or of which we hereafter become aware.

   NOTES    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE       1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. However, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations, changes in comprehensive income and cash flows for the unaudited interim periods.   
     
  The results of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period. The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes presented herein should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Eagle s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
     
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for 2016. These reclassifications had no impact on net income or total shareholders  equity. Certain loan amounts were reclassified for prior periods to be consistent with loan category classification for September 30, 2016. Interchange and ATM fees and appreciation in cash surrender value of life insurance were previously included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. These amounts were presented on their own lines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and prior year amounts were reclassed to be consistent with the current year presentation.   
     
  The Company evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through November 9, 2016 the date the unaudited consolidated financial statements were issued.  
     
    NOTE 2.       INVESTMENT SECURITIES    
     
  Investment securities are summarized as follows:   

Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities and the associated gross realized gains and losses were as follows:

  The amortized cost and fair value of securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  

Maturities of securities do not reflect repricing opportunities present in adjustable rate securities.  
     
  The Company s investment securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve or more months were as follows:

    NOTE 2.       INVESTMENT SECURITIES - continued    
     
  Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 32 and 85, respectively, securities in an unrealized loss position and that were considered to be temporarily impaired and therefore an impairment charge has not been recorded.   
     
  At September 30, 2016, 15 U.S. government and agency securities and municipal obligations had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately 0.85% from the Company s amortized cost basis of these securities. At December 31, 2015, 52 U.S. government and agency securities and municipal obligations had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately 1.43% from the Company s amortized cost basis of these securities. These unrealized losses are principally due to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and industry analysts' reports. As management has the ability to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future, no declines are deemed to be other than temporary.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, 9 corporate obligations had unrealized losses of approximately 2.56% from the Company s amortized cost basis of these securities. At December 31, 2015, 13 corporate obligations had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately 1.76% from the Company's amortized cost basis of these securities. These unrealized losses are principally due to changes in interest rates. No credit issues have been identified that cause management to believe the declines in market value are other than temporary. In analyzing the issuer's financial condition, management considers industry analysts' reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts within a one-year time frame. As management has the ability to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future, no declines are deemed to be other than temporary.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, 8 mortgage-backed securities ( MBSs ) and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ) had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately 0.87% from the Company s amortized cost basis of these securities. At December 31, 2015, 20 MBSs and CMOs had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately 1.57% from the Company s amortized cost basis of these securities. We believe these unrealized losses are principally due to the credit market s concerns regarding the stability of the mortgage market, changes in interest rates and credit spreads and uncertainty of future prepayment speeds. Management considers available evidence to assess whether it is more likely-than-not that all amounts due would not be collected. In such assessment, management considers the severity and duration of the impairment, the credit ratings of the security, the overall deal and payment structure, including the Company's position within the structure, underlying obligor, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, delinquencies, defaults, loss severities, recoveries, prepayments, cumulative loss projections, discounted cash flows and fair value estimates. There has been no disruption of the scheduled cash flows on any of the securities. Management s analysis as of September 30, 2016 revealed no expected credit losses on the securities and therefore, declines are not deemed to be other than temporary.

  Loans receivable consisted of the following:  

Within the commercial real estate loan category above, $11,723,000 and $12,117,000 was guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, within the commercial loan category above, $1,631,000 and $1,917,000 were in loans originated through a syndication program where the business resides outside of Montana, at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.

    NOTE 3.       LOANS RECEIVABLE - continued    

The Company utilizes a 5 point internal loan rating system, largely based on regulatory classifications, as follows:  
     
   Loans rated Pass      Loans that are considered to be protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, or by the value of the asset or the underlying collateral.  
       
   Loans rated Special Mention      Loans that have potential weaknesses and are watched closely by management. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset at some future date.   
       
   Loans rated Substandard      Loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  
       
   Loans rated Doubtful      Loans that have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic of weaknesses making collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
       
   Loans rated Loss      Loans that are considered uncollectible and of such small value that continuance as assets without establishment of a specific reserve is not warranted. This classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but, rather, that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off a basically worthless asset even though practical recovery may be affected in the future.

  On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings of all commercial real estate, construction, and commercial business loans that have a principal balance of $750,000 or more. Quarterly, the Company reviews the rating of any consumer loan, broadly defined, that is delinquent 90 days or more. Likewise, quarterly, the Company reviews the rating of any commercial loan, broadly defined, that is delinquent 60 days or more. Annually, the Company engages an independent third-party to review a significant portion of loans within these segments. Management uses the results of these reviews as part of its annual review process.   
     
  Internal classification of the loan portfolio was as follows:

    NOTE 4.       TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS    
     
  The Company adopted the amendments in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-02 during the quarter ended September 30, 2011. As required, the Company reassessed all restructurings that occurred on or after the beginning of the previous fiscal year (July 1, 2011) for identification as troubled debt restructurings. The Company identified as troubled debt restructurings certain receivables for which the allowance for credit losses had previously been measured under a general allowance for credit losses methodology (ASC 450-20). Upon identifying the reassessed receivables as troubled debt restructurings, the Company also identified them as impaired under the guidance in ASC 310-10-35. The amendments in the guidance require prospective application of the impairment measurement for those receivables newly identified as impaired.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the recorded investment in receivables for which the allowance for credit losses was previously measured under a general allowance for credit losses methodology and are now impaired under Section 310-10-35 was $44,000 (310-40-65-1(b)), and there was no allowance for credit losses associated with these receivables, on the basis of a current evaluation of loss (310-40-65-1(b)). There was $34,000 charged-off at the time of restructure related to these receivables.   
     
  The Company offers a variety of modifications to borrowers. The modification categories offered can generally be described in the following categories:  
     
   Rate Modification    A modification in which the interest rate is changed.  
     
   Term Modification    A modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments, or frequency of payments is changed.  
     
   Interest Only Modification    A modification in which the loan is converted to interest only payments for a period of time.  
     
   Payment Modification    A modification in which the dollar amount of the payment is changed, other than an interest only modification described above.  
     
   Combination Modification    Any other type of modification, including the use of multiple categories above.

The Bank s policy is that loans placed on non-accrual will typically remain on non-accrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospect for future payment in accordance with the loan agreement appears relatively certain. The Bank s policy generally refers to six months of payment performance as sufficient to warrant a return to accrual status.  
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no new restructured loans.   
     
  There were no loans modified as a troubled debt restructured loan within the previous nine months for which there was a payment default during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  A default for purposes of this disclosure is a troubled debt restructured loan in which the borrower is 90 days past due or results in the foreclosure and repossession of the applicable collateral. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no commitments to lend additional funds to loan customers whose terms had been modified in trouble debt restructures.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  
       
    NOTE 10.     D    ERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES     
       
  The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is interest rate risk. The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on August 27, 2010 with a third party to manage interest rate risk associated with a fixed-rate loan. The interest rate swap agreement effectively converted the loan s fixed rate into a variable rate. The derivatives and hedging accounting guidance (ASC Subtopic 815-10) requires that the Company recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the statement of financial position. In accordance with this guidance, the Company designated the interest rate swap on this fixed-rate loan as a fair value hedge.   
     
  The Company was exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to this agreement. The Company controlled the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures, and did not expect any counterparties to fail their obligations. The Company deals only with primary dealers.  
     
  If certain hedging criteria specified in derivatives and hedging accounting guidance are met, including testing for hedge effectiveness, hedge accounting may be applied. The hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed in a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships.  
     
  The hedge documentation specifies the terms of the hedged item and the interest rate swap. The documentation also indicates that the derivative is hedging a fixed-rate item, that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair value of the hedged item, and that the strategy is to eliminate fair value variability by converting fixed-rate interest payments to variable-rate interest payments.  
     
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. The Company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items in the same line item noninterest income as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swap.  
       
  The fixed rate loan hedged had an original maturity of 20 years and was not callable. This loan was hedged with a  pay fixed rate, receive variable rate  swap with a similar notional amount, maturity, and fixed rate coupons. The swap was not callable. At December 31, 2014, the loan had an outstanding principal balance of $10,641,000 and the interest rate swap had a notional value of $10,673,000.  
     
  At December 31, 2014, the interest rate swap on the fixed-rate loan was ineffective. The Bank recorded a loss of $317,000 in noninterest income during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 related to the ineffectiveness. The interest rate swap was terminated during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The Bank recorded a loss of $93,000 in noninterest income during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 related to the swap termination. The loan fair value adjustment of $138,000 at March 31, 2015 will be amortized over the remaining life of the loan which matures September 1, 2030. The remaining balance was $125,000 at September 30, 2016.  
     
  Mortgage loan commitments are referred to as derivative loan commitments if the loan that will result from exercise of the commitment will be held-for-sale upon funding. The Company enters into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future, with the intention that these loans will subsequently be sold in the secondary market. A mortgage loan commitment binds the Company to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, generally up to 60 days after inception of the rate lock.  
     
  Outstanding derivative loan commitments expose the Company to the risk that the price of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitment might decline from inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan due to increases in mortgage interest rates. If interest rates increase, the value of these loan commitments decreases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, the value of these loan commitments increases. The notional amount of interest rate lock commitments was $39,246,000 and $24,378,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of such commitments was insignificant.   
     
  The Company has no other off-balance-sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated, special purpose entities that would expose the Company to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements.

    NOTE 11. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES    
     
  FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall   not be adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and, (iv) willing to transact.  
     
  FASB ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement costs). Valuation techniques should be consistently applied.   
     
  Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. In that regard, FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.   
     
  The fair value hierarchy is as follows:  
     
   Level 1 Inputs    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date, or convert to cash in the short term.  
     
   Level 2 Inputs    Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.  
     
   Level 3 Inputs    Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  
     
  A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.  
     
  In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. While management believes the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.  
     
   Available-for-Sale Securities    Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U. S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things.  
     
   Impaired Loans    Impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Collateral values are estimated using Level 3 inputs based on internally customized discounting criteria.

   Loans Held-for-Sale    These loans are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based on expected proceeds based on sales contracts and commitments and are considered Level 2 inputs.  
     
   Repossessed Assets    Fair values are valued at the time the loan is foreclosed upon and the asset is transferred from loans. The value is based upon primary third party appraisals, less costs to sell. The appraisals are generally discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business. Such discounts are typically significant and result in Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Repossessed assets are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on same or similar factors above.  
     
   Derivative Financial Instruments    Fair values for interest rate swap agreements were based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts. These instruments were valued using Level 2 inputs utilizing valuation models that considered: (a) time value, (b) volatility factors and (c) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.   
     
  The following tables summarize financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value.

  Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).   
     
  The following tables summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:  

As of September 30, 2016, certain impaired loans were remeasured and reported at fair value through a specific valuation allowance allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans with a carrying value of $1,465,000 were reduced by specific valuation allowance allocations totaling $29,000 to a total reported fair value of $1,436,000 based on collateral valuations utilizing Level 3 valuation inputs.   
     
  As of December 31, 2015, certain impaired loans were remeasured and reported at fair value through a specific valuation allowance allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans with a carrying value of $2,076,000 were reduced by specific valuation allowance allocations totaling $48,000 to a total reported fair value of $2,028,000 based on collateral valuations utilizing Level 3 valuation inputs.   
     
  The following table represents the Banks s Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial assets and liabilities, and the significant unobservable inputs and the ranges of values for those inputs.

  FASB ASC Topic 825 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the statement of financial position, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Below is a table that summarizes the fair market values of all financial instruments of the Company at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, followed by methods and assumptions that were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of the classes of financial instruments.  
     
  The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of the following classes of financial instruments. However, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 provides additional description of valuation methodologies used in estimating fair value of these financial instruments.  
     
   Cash, Interest Bearing Accounts, Accrued Interest and Dividends Receivable and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities    The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.  
       
   Stock in the F  ederal Home   L  oan   B  ank of Des Moines ( FHLB )   and F  ederal   R  eserve   B  ank ( FRB )    The fair value of stock approximates redemption value.  
     
   Loans Receivable    Fair values are estimated by stratifying the loan portfolio into groups of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as real estate, commercial, and consumer, with each category further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms. For mortgage loans, the Company uses the secondary market rates in effect for loans that have similar characteristics. The fair value of other fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the anticipated maturities adjusted for prepayment estimates. Adjustable interest rate loans are assumed to approximate fair value because they generally reprice within the short term.  
     
  Fair values are adjusted for credit risk based on assessment of risk identified with specific loans, and risk adjustments on the remaining portfolio based on credit loss experience.  
     
  Assumptions regarding credit risk are judgmentally determined using specific borrower information, internal credit quality analysis, and historical information on segmented loan categories for non-specific borrowers.  
     
   Mortgage   S  ervicing   R  ights    the fair value of servicing rights was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10.00% to 12.00%, prepayment speeds ranging from approximately 105.00% to 369.00% PSA, depending on stratification of the specific right. The fair value was also adjusted for the effect of potential past dues and foreclosures.

The fair value of time certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar maturities.  
     
   Advances from the FHLB and Subordinated Debentures    The fair value of the Company s advances and debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the interest rate that would be effective September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively if the borrowings repriced according to their stated terms.   
     
   Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments    Fair values for off-balance-sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. The fair values of these financial instruments are considered insignificant. Additionally, those financial instruments have no carrying value.  
     
    NOTE 12. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance is a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede substantially all existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under existing guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date of the standard by one year. Therefore, the new standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact to the Company s financial statements.  
     
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments also require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the estimated amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendment is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have a significant impact to the Company s financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01  Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendment has a number of provisions including the requirements that public business entities use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, a separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e. securities or loans receivables), and eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost.  The amendment is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the amendment on the Company s financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842) intended to improve financial reporting regarding leasing transactions. The new standard affects all companies and organizations that lease assets.  The standard will require organizations to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases if the lease terms are more than 12 months. The guidance also will require qualitative and quantitative disclosures providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the amendment on the Company s financial statements.

  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326) intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The standard requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Additionally, the standard amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity will apply the amendments in this update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). The Company believes the amendments in this update will have an impact on the Company s financial statements and is working to evaluate the significance of that impact.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
       
    Item      2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
     
    Overview    
     
  The Company s primary business activity is the ownership of its wholly owned subsidiary, Opportunity Bank of Montana (the  Bank ). The Bank is a Montana chartered commercial bank that focuses on both consumer and commercial lending. It engages in typical banking activities: acquiring deposits from local markets and originating loans and investing in securities. Its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank s primary component of earnings is its net interest margin (also called spread or margin), the difference between interest income and interest expense. The net interest margin is managed by management (through the pricing of its products and by the types of products offered and kept in portfolio), and is affected by changes in market interest rates. The Bank also generates noninterest income in the form of fee income and gain on sale of loans.   
     
  The Bank has a strong mortgage lending focus, with a large portion of its loan originations represented by single-family residential mortgages, which has enabled it to successfully market home equity loans, as well as a wide range of shorter term consumer loans for various personal needs (automobiles, recreational vehicles, etc.). In recent years, the Bank has focused on adding commercial loans to its portfolio, both real estate and non-real estate. We have made significant progress in this initiative. The purpose of this diversification is to mitigate the Bank s dependence on the residential mortgage market, as well as to improve its ability to manage its spread. The Bank s management recognizes that fee income will also enable it to be less dependent on specialized lending and it now maintains a significant loan serviced portfolio which provides a steady source of fee income. Fee income is also supplemented with fees generated from the Bank s deposit accounts. The Bank has a high percentage of non-maturity deposits, such as checking accounts and savings accounts, which allows management flexibility in managing its spread. Non-maturity deposits and certificates of deposits do not automatically reprice as interest rates rise. Gain on sale of loans also provides significant noninterest income in periods of high mortgage loan origination volumes. Such income will be adversely affected in periods of lower mortgage activity.   
     
  In recent years, management s focus has been on improving the Bank s core earnings. Core earnings can be described as income before taxes, with the exclusion of gain on sale of loans and adjustments to the market value of the Bank s loan servicing portfolio. Management believes that the Bank will need to continue to focus on increasing net interest margin, other areas of fee income and control of operating expenses to achieve earnings growth going forward. Management s strategy of growing the bank s loan portfolio and deposit base is expected to help achieve these goals as follows: loans typically earn higher rates of return than investments; a larger deposit base should yield higher fee income; increasing the asset base will reduce the relative impact of fixed operating costs. The biggest challenge to the strategy is funding the growth of the Bank s balance sheet in an efficient manner. Though deposit growth has been steady, it may become more difficult to maintain due to significant competition and possible reduced customer demand for deposits as customers may shift into other asset classes.  
     
  The level and movement of interest rates impacts the Bank s earnings as well. The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) changed the federal funds target rate from 0.25% to 0.50% in December 2015. The rate remained at 0.50% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  From time to time the Bank has considered growth through mergers or acquisition as an alternative to its strategy of organic growth. In this regard, the Bank has experienced an increase in mortgage loan originations due to the Sterling branch acquisition which closed in December 2012. Deposit fee income has also increased due to the increase in the number of accounts. The addition of the wealth management division from the acquisition has also increased noninterest income and furthered the Bank s strategy to increase fee income to complement margin. Operating expenses, primarily salaries and employee benefits also increased as a result of the acquisition.   
     
  The Bank completed a core systems conversion during the year ended December 31, 2015. Future cost savings are anticipated due to the core systems conversion.

    Financial Condition    
     
  Comparisons of financial condition in this section are between September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $674.50 million, an increase of $44.15 million, or 7.0%, from $630.35 million at December 31, 2015. Loans receivable increased by $53.12 million, or 13.2%, to $456.85 million at September 30, 2016. Securities available-for-sale decreased by $11.99 million, or 8.2%, to $133.75 million at September 30, 2016. Total liabilities at September 30, 2016 were $614.46 million, an increase of $39.56 million, or 6.9%, from $574.90 million at December 31, 2015. Total deposits increased $32.10 million or 6.6%, to $515.28 million at September 30, 2016. Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances and other borrowings increased $6.14 million, or 8.4%, to $78.86 million at September 30, 2016.   
     
   Balance Sheet Details   
     
    Investment     Activities    
     
  The following table summarizes investment activities:   

Securities available-for-sale were $133.75 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $11.99 million, or 8.2%, from $145.74 million at December 31, 2015. The largest decrease in securities available-for-sale was in CMOs, which decreased $8.64 million primarily due to sales activity. U.S. government and agency securities decreased by $4.64 million largely due to a security sale. MBSs decreased $1.69 million. This decrease was due to MBSs sales and principal payments received partially offset by MBSs purchases. Municipal obligations increased by $3.10 million due to purchase activity partially offset by sales activity.

    Lending Activities    
     
  The following table includes the composition of the Bank s loan portfolio by loan category:   

(1)  Excludes loans held for sale.  
     
  Loans receivable increased $53.12 million to $456.85 million at September 30, 2016. The increase was largely due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $37.89 million and commercial loans of $21.03 million. Home equity loans increased by $2.34 million. Consumer loans remained consistent period over period only increasing $226,000. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in residential mortgage loans of $4.84 million and construction loans of $2.31 million. Total loan originations were $310.44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with residential mortgages accounting for $236.87 million of the total. Commercial real estate and land loan originations were $45.00 million. Home equity and construction loan originations were $729,000 and $1.44 million, respectively, for the same period. Consumer loan originations were $6.06 million. Commercial loan originations were $20.34 million, with none originating from loan syndication programs with borrowers residing outside of Montana. Loans held-for-sale increased slightly to $19.42 million at September 30, 2016 from $18.70 million at December 31, 2015.   
     
   Nonperforming Assets . Generally, our collection procedures provide that when a loan is 15 or more days delinquent, the borrower is sent a past due notice. If the loan becomes 30 days delinquent, the borrower is sent a written delinquency notice requiring payment. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower, including face to face meetings and counseling to resolve the delinquency. All collection actions are undertaken with the objective of compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Act.

    Lending Activities           continued    
     
  For mortgage loans and home equity loans, if the borrower is unable to cure the delinquency or reach a payment agreement, we will institute foreclosure actions. If a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs. The initial recording of any loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had $512,000 of real estate owned.  
     
  The following table sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets:

    Deposits and Other Sources of Funds    
     
  The following table includes deposit accounts by category:  

Deposits . Deposits increased $32.10 million, or 6.6%, to $515.28 million at September 30, 2016 from $483.18 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was largely due to an increase in certificates of deposit of $17.17 million. This increase was impacted by additional brokered certificates obtained in the amount of $11.00 million. Noninterest checking increased $12.21 million and savings increased $9.20 million. Interest bearing checking also increased slightly by $2.52 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in money market accounts of $9.00 million.  
     
   Borrowings . Advances from FHLB and other borrowings increased by $6.14 million, or 8.4%, to $78.86 million at September 30, 2016 from $72.72 million at December 31, 2015. Borrowings were used to help fund the robust loan growth.   
     
    Shareholders  Equity    
     
  Total shareholders  equity increased $4.59 million, or 8.3%, to $60.04 million at September 30, 2016 from $55.45 million at December 31, 2015. This was a result of an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.63 million mainly due to an increase in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities and net income of $3.68 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $888,000.   
       
    Analysis of Net Interest Income    
     
  The Bank s earnings have historically depended primarily upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and any borrowed funds. It is the single largest component of Eagle s operating income. Net interest income is affected by (i) the difference between rates of interest earned on loans and investments and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings (the  interest rate spread ) and (ii) the relative amounts of loans and investments and interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 201    6     and 201    5    
     
   Net Income  .  Eagle s net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.77 million compared to $521,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $1.25 million was due to an increase in noninterest income of $1.78 million and an increase in net interest income after loan loss provision of $826,000, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $667,000 and an increase in income tax expense of $685,000. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.46 for the current period and $0.14 per share for the prior year comparable period.  
     
   Net Interest Income  .  Net interest income increased to $5.42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $4.43 million for the same quarter in the prior year. This increase of $988,000 was the result of an increase in interest and dividend income of $1.06 million, slightly offset by an increase in interest expense of $66,000.  
       
   Interest and Dividend Income  .  Interest and dividend income was $6.21 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.06 million, or 20.6%. Interest and fees on loans increased to $5.46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.39 million for the same period ended September 30, 2015. This increase of $1.07 million, or 24.4%, was due to an increase in the average balance of loans, as well as, an increase in the average yield of loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Average balances for loans receivable, net, including loans held-for-sale, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $471.44 million, compared to $384.28 million for the prior year period. This represents an increase of $87.16 million, or 22.7%. The average interest rate earned on loans receivable increased by 6 basis points, from 4.57% to 4.63%. Interest and dividends on investment securities available-for-sale decreased slightly by $50,000 or 6.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Average balances for investments decreased to $134.39 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $148.01 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Average interest rates earned on investments increased slightly to 2.11% from 2.05%.

    Results of Operations for     the Three Months Ended September 30    , 201    6     and 201    5       continued    
       
   Interest Expense  .  Total interest expense was $787,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $721,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $66,000 or 9.2%. Interest expense for total borrowings was $404,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $321,000 for the comparable prior period. The average balance for total borrowings was $99.25 million for September 30, 2016 compared to $60.62 million for September 30, 2015. However, the average rate paid on total borrowings decreased from 2.12% last year to 1.63% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Borrowings have been used to help fund continued loan growth. Interest expense on deposits was $383,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $400,000 for the same period in the prior year. The average balance for total deposits was $500.38 million for September 30, 2016 compared to $478.64 million for September 30, 2015. However, the overall average rate on deposits was 0.31% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
       
   Loan Loss   Provision.  Loan loss provisions are charged to earnings to maintain the total allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate by management of the Bank, to provide for probable loan losses based on prior loss experience, volume and type of lending conducted by the Bank and past due loans in the portfolio. The Bank s policies require review of assets on a quarterly basis. The Bank classifies loans as well as other assets if warranted. While management believes it uses the best information available to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses, it recognizes that future adjustments may be necessary. The Bank recorded $472,000 in loan loss provisions for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $310,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The loan loss provision has been increased to keep pace with increasing loan production that is fueling loan growth.   
     
   Noninterest Income  .  Total noninterest income increased to $4.69 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $2.91 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.78 million or 61.2%. The increase is largely due to an increase in net gain on sale of loans which increased to $3.16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.64 million for the prior period. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, $100.83 million residential mortgages were originated compared to $65.79 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. In addition, $95.55 million mortgage loans were sold during the current quarter compared to $57.55 million in the same quarter in the prior year.  
     
   Noninterest Expense  .  Noninterest expense was $7.16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.49 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is largely due to increased salaries and employee benefits expenses of $517,000. Increased salaries expense is due in part to higher commission-based compensation related to loan production for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
       
   Income Tax Expense  .  Income tax expense was $707,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 28.5%.  
     
    Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 201    6     and 201    5    
     
   Net Income  .  Eagle s net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.68 million compared to $1.70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $1.98 million, or 116.5%, was primarily due to an increase in net interest income after loan loss provision of $1.66 million and an increase in noninterest income of $2.32 million, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $1.06 million and an increase in income tax expense of $936,000. Basic earnings per share were $0.97 for the current period and diluted earnings per share were $0.95 for the current period. Basic and diluted earnings per share were both $0.44 for prior year comparable period.  
     
   Net Interest Income.  Net interest income increased to $15.23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $13.15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase of $2.08 million, or 15.8%, was the result of an increase in interest and dividend income of $2.67 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $577,000.

    Res    ults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30    , 201    6     and 201    5       continued    
       
   Interest and Dividend Income  .  Interest and dividend income was $17.56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $14.89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.67 million, or 17.9%. Interest and fees on loans increased to $15.25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $12.61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase of $2.64 million, or 20.9%, was due to an increase in the average balance of loans partially offset by a decrease in the average yield of loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Average balances for loans receivable, net, including loans held-for-sale, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $449.33 million, compared to $361.36 million for the prior year period. This represents an increase of $87.97 million, or 24.3%. The average interest rate earned on loans receivable decreased by 12 basis points, from 4.65% to 4.53%. Interest and dividends on investment securities available-for-sale decreased slightly by $59,000 or 2.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Average balances for investments decreased to $141.06 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $151.78 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. However, average interest rates earned on investments increased to 2.08% from 1.98%.   
       
   Interest Expense  .  Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.33 million compared to $1.75 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for total borrowings was $1.21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $655,000 for the prior year comparable period. The average balance for total borrowings was $94.12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $54.18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average rate paid on borrowings was also higher. The average rate paid on borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 1.71% compared to 1.61% for the comparable period. Borrowings have been used to help fund the robust loan growth. Also, in June 2015, the Company completed the issuance of $10.00 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due in 2025. Interest expense on deposits increased by $26,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average balance for total deposits was $491.99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $460.82 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. However, the overall average rate on deposits was down slightly from 0.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 0.30% for the current year.  
       
   Loan Loss   Provision  .  Loan loss provisions are charged to earnings to maintain the total allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate by management of the Bank, to provide for probable loan losses based on prior loss experience, volume and type of lending conducted by the Bank and past due loans in the portfolio. The Bank s policies require a review of assets on a quarterly basis. The Bank classifies loans as well as other assets if warranted. While management believes it uses the best information available to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses, it recognizes that future adjustments may be necessary. The Bank recorded $1.38 million in loan loss provisions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $960,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The loan loss provision has been increased to keep pace with increasing loan production that is fueling loan growth. Total nonperforming loans were $1.77 million at September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had $513,000 in foreclosed real estate property and other repossessed property.   
     
   Noninterest Income.  Total noninterest income increased to $11.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $9.07 million for the prior year comparable period, an increase of $2.32 million or 25.6%. The increase is largely due to an increase in net gain on sale of loans which increased to $7.32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $236.87 million residential mortgages were originated compared to $188.46 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, $217.60 million mortgage loans were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $177.17 million in the same period in the prior year.  
     
   Noninterest Expense  .  Noninterest expense was $20.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19.33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $1.06 million, or 5.5%, is largely due to increased salaries and employee benefits expenses of $1.10 million. Increased salaries expense is due in part to higher commission-based compensation related to loan production for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
       
   Income Tax Expense  .  Income tax expense was $1.17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $230,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 24.0%. Income tax expense has increased with our increased income levels. However, tax free municipal bond income and Bank owned life insurance income help to lower the overall effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is further reduced by a tax credit investment entered into by the Company in fiscal year 2013. The Bank made an investment in Certified Development Entities which have received allocations of New Markets Tax Credits ( NMTC ). Administered by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the NMTC program is aimed at stimulating economic and community development and job creation in low-income communities. The federal income tax credits received are claimed over an estimated seven-year credit allowance period.

    Liquidity     and     Capital Resources    
     
    Liquidity    
     
  The Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by the Montana Division of Banking and Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) regulations. The liquidity requirement is retained for safety and soundness purposes, and appropriate levels of liquidity will depend upon the types of activities in which the company engages. For internal reporting purposes, the Bank uses policy minimums of 1.0%, and 8.0% for  basic surplus  and  basic surplus with FHLB  as internally defined. In general, the  basic surplus  is a calculation of the ratio of unencumbered short-term assets reduced by estimated percentages of CD maturities and other deposits that may leave the Bank in the next 90 days divided by total assets.  Basic surplus with FHLB  adds to  basic surplus  the additional borrowing capacity the Bank has with the FHLB of Des Moines. The Bank exceeded those minimum ratios as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  The Bank s primary sources of funds are deposits, repayment of loans and mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities, maturities of investments, funds provided from operations, and advances from the FHLB and other borrowings. Scheduled repayments of loans and mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities and maturities of investment securities are generally predictable. However, other sources of funds, such as deposit flows and loan prepayments, can be greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank uses liquidity resources principally to fund existing and future loan commitments. It also uses them to fund maturing certificates of deposit, demand deposit withdrawals and to invest in other loans and investments, maintain liquidity and meet operating expenses.  
     
  Liquidity may be adversely affected by unexpected deposit outflows, higher interest rates paid by competitors and similar matters. Management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the level desirable, based in part on commitments to make loans and management s assessment of the Bank s ability to generate funds.  
     
    Capital Resources    
     
  As of August 31, 2016 (the most recent report available for September 30, 2016), the Bank s internally determined measurement of sensitivity to interest rate movements as measured by a 200 basis point rise in interest rates scenario, increased the economic value of equity ( EVE ) by 7.0% compared to a decrease of 1.8% as of November 30, 2015 (the most recent report available for December 31, 2015). The Bank is within the guidelines set forth by the Board of Directors for interest rate risk sensitivity in rising interest rate scenarios.   
     
  Beginning January 1, 2015, community banking organizations became subject to a new regulatory rule recently adopted by federal banking agencies (commonly referred to as Basel III). The new rule establishes a new regulatory capital framework that incorporates revisions to the Basel capital framework, strengthens the definition of regulatory capital, increases risk-based capital requirements, and amends the methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets. These changes are expected to increase the amount of capital required by community banking organizations. Basel III includes a multiyear transition period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019.  
     
  The Banks s Tier I leverage ratio, as measured under State of Montana and FRB rules, decreased slightly from 9.36% as of December 31, 2015 to 9.18% as of September 30, 2016. The Bank s strong capital position helps to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s regulatory capital was in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s total capital, Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 14.02%, 13.01%, 13.01% and 9.18% ,  respectively, compared to regulatory requirements of 8.0%, 6.0%, 4.5% and 4.0%, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk    
       
  Interest rate risk is the potential for loss of future earnings resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk results from several factors and could have a significant impact on the Company s net interest income, which is the Company primary source of net income. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the relationship between rates on interest bearing assets and liabilities, the impact of interest fluctuations on asset prepayments and the mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities.  
     
  Although interest rate risk is inherent in the banking industry, banks are expected to have sound risk management practices in place to measure, monitor and control interest rate exposures. The objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates.   
     
  The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the Company s asset/liability committee, which is governed by policies established by the Company s Board that are reviewed and approved annually. The Board delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset/liability management policies to the Bank s asset/liability committee. In this capacity, the asset/liability committee develops guidelines and strategies impacting the Company s asset/liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends. The Company s goal of its asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk. Our asset and liability policy and strategies are expected to continue as described so long as competitive and regulatory conditions in the financial institution industry and market interest rates continue as they have in recent years.

    Interest Rate Risk             continued    
     
  The Bank has established acceptable levels of interest rate risk as follows: Projected net interest income over the next twelve months will not be reduced by more than 15.0% given a change in interest rates of up to 200 basis points (+ or -).   
     
  The following table includes the Banks s net interest income sensitivity analysis.  

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices    
     
  Our financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
       
    Item      4. Controls and Procedures   
     
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and our Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.   
     
  In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we identified a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting.  The significant deficiency consisted of two separate issues that resulted in the overstatement of interest income on mortgage loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Management has determined that the misstatement occurred because of errors that occurred during loan setup for mortgage loans that were sold with servicing retained. The issue had been identified, but the severity had not been properly determined in a timely manner which allowed the misstatement to cross a quarterly reporting period.   
     
  We remediated the significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting noted above (and consequent deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures), by implementing certain changes to the design of our internal controls. Specifically, we have provided additional training and strengthened the oversight and review of loan transactions, particularly relative to the sold mortgage loans. We have also formulated a management level disclosure committee to review and certify accuracy of public filings, provided additional training to executive management regarding the escalation of issues to those involved in financial reporting, and created a written escalation process.    
     
  Except as described above, during the last quarter, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
