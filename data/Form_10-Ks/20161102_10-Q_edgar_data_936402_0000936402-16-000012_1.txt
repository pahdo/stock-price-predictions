THE  SAFE HARBOR  STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995    
  Statements included herein that are not historical facts, including without limitation statements concerning future strategy, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the anticipated timing of clinical trials and approvals for, and the commercial potential of, inline or pipeline products are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time. In the event such risks or uncertainties materialize, Shire s results could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: 
             
    Shire s products may not be a commercial success; 
                
    increased pricing pressures and limits on patient access as a result of governmental regulations and market developments may affect Shire s future revenues, financial condition and results of operations; 
                
    Shire conducts its own manufacturing operations for certain of its products and is reliant on third party contract manufacturers to manufacture other products and to provide goods and services. Some of Shire s products or ingredients are only available from a single approved source for manufacture. Any disruption to the supply chain for any of Shire s products may result in Shire being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in Shire being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis for some period of time; 
                
    the manufacture of Shire s products is subject to extensive oversight by various regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals or interventions associated with changes to manufacturing sites, ingredients or manufacturing processes could lead to significant delays, an increase in operating costs, lost product sales, an interruption of research activities or the delay of new product launches; 
                
    certain of Shire s therapies involve lengthy and complex processes, which may prevent Shire from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing its production capacity; 
                
    Shire has a portfolio of products in various stages of research and development. The successful development of these products is highly uncertain and requires significant expenditures and time, and there is no guarantee that these products will receive regulatory approval; 
                
    the actions of certain customers could affect Shire s ability to sell or market products profitably. Fluctuations in buying or distribution patterns by such customers can adversely affect Shire s revenues, financial conditions or results of operations; 
                
    Shire s products and product candidates face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates, including competition from generics; 
                
    adverse outcomes in legal matters, tax audits and other disputes, including Shire s ability to enforce and defend patents and other intellectual property rights required for its business, could have a material adverse effect on the combined company s revenues, financial condition or results of operations; 
                
    inability to successfully compete for highly qualified personnel from other companies and organizations; 
                
    failure to achieve the strategic objectives with respect to Shire s acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( NPS ), Dyax Corp. ( Dyax ) or Baxalta Incorporated ( Baxalta ) may adversely affect Shire s financial condition and results of operations; 
                
    Shire s growth strategy depends in part upon its ability to expand its product portfolio through external collaborations, which, if unsuccessful, may adversely affect the development and sale of its products; 
                
    a slowdown of global economic growth, or economic instability of countries in which Shire does business, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, that adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and customer purchasing and payment patterns, including the collectability of customer accounts receivable; 
     
   2 

     Table of Contents  

failure of a marketed product to work effectively or if such a product is the cause of adverse side effects could result in damage to Shire s reputation, the withdrawal of the product and legal action against Shire; 
                
    investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to Shire s activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines; 
                
    Shire is dependent on information technology and its systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from service disruptions, the loss of sensitive or confidential information, cyber-attacks and other security breaches or data leakages that could have a material adverse effect on Shire s revenues, financial condition or results of operations; 
                
    Shire incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the Baxalta acquisition, which may decrease its business flexibility and increase borrowing costs; 
                
    difficulties in integrating Dyax or Baxalta into Shire may lead to the combined company not being able to realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits at the time anticipated or at all; and  
     other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Shire s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including those risks outlined in  ITEM 1A: Risk Factors  in Shire's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
  All forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Presentation    
  These interim financial statements of Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively  Shire  or the  Company ) are unaudited. They have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). 
  The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from audited financial statements. 
  These interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016, and as updated by a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 2, 2016 (the  Shire 2015 Form 10-K ). 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted from these interim financial statements. However, these interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly state the results of the interim period and the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. 
  On June 3, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Baxalta for   $32.4 billion  , representing the preliminary fair value of purchase consideration. The Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of Baxalta from the date of acquisition. For further details regarding the acquisition, please refer to Note 2, Business Combinations, of these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, due to the Baxalta acquisition, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to reclassify the Amortization of Acquired Intangibles from Selling, General and Administrative on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Accordingly, the Company reclassified the Amortization of Acquired Intangibles from Selling, General and Administrative in comparative periods to conform to the current classification.   
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of intangible assets, sales deductions, income taxes (including provisions for uncertain tax positions and the realization of deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and legal proceedings, measurement of pension and other post-employment plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost, contingent consideration receivable from product divestments and contingent consideration payable in respect of business combinations and asset purchases and valuation of other assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. On an on-going basis the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
  Accounting Policy Updates    
  The Company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the Shire 2015 Form 10-K. The following significant accounting policies have been updated as a result of the Baxalta acquisition. 
  Financial instruments - derivatives    
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The Company has assumed derivatives related to the Baxalta acquisition and has elected to apply hedge accounting for certain derivatives. 
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flow hedges are classified in revenues and cost of sales and primarily relate to forecasted third-party sales denominated in foreign currencies and forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign currencies, respectively. 
  For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item. Fair value hedges are classified in interest income and interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain of the Company s fixed-rate debt. 
  In its application of hedge accounting, the Company assesses, both at inception and on a prospective basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged items. The Company also assesses hedge effectiveness on a retrospective basis every quarter with any hedge ineffectiveness recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
  The Company uses forward contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of the Company s intercompany and third-party receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative instruments generally are not formally designated as hedges and the terms of these instruments generally do not exceed three months. The fair values of these instruments are included on the balance sheet in current assets/liabilities, with changes in the fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cash flows relating to these instruments are presented within net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging specific investing or financing activities.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements    
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company does not believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption.  
  Adopted during the current period    
  Reporting requirements for development stage entities    
  In June 2014, the FASB simplified the existing guidance for development stage entities by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements and the exception available for development stage entities when determining whether the development stage entity is a variable interest entity. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. Shire adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 with prospective application. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Debt Issuance Costs    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued a new standard that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued additional guidance which clarified that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can be presented in the balance sheet as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs were not affected by these amendments. 
  Shire adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 with retroactive application. The Short-term borrowings and Long-term borrowings line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and related footnote disclosures for all periods presented have been adjusted. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company s results of operations or cash flows. 
  Cloud Computing Arrangement 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. Under the standard, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the software license element  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

of the arrangement should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. Shire adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 with prospective application. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Measurement-Period Adjustments 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for adjustments related to business combinations arising within one year of the acquisition. The new standard requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and record the effect on earnings of those changes as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, and sets forth new disclosure requirements related to the adjustments. Shire adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 with prospective application. The adoption of this guidance impacted the recognition and disclosure of measurement period adjustments identified during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the Baxalta acquisition. Refer to Note 2, Business Combinations, of these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
  Financial Instrument Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call and put options that can accelerate the payment of principal of debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt host. This guidance will be effective beginning on January 1, 2017, and modified retrospective application is required. Early adoption is permitted.  This guidance was adopted in the third quarter of 2016 and had no impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 
  Pension Plans 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which removes the disclosure requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments that measure fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient and certain disclosures associated with these types of investments. This guidance became effective beginning on January 1, 2016, and retrospective application is required. This guidance was adopted during the current period and impacted the disclosure of certain acquired pension plan assets in the fair value hierarchy in Note 15, Retirement and Other Benefit Programs, but did not impact the Company's financial position or results of operations.  
  To be adopted in future periods    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. The new standard also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued additional guidance that delayed the effective date of the new standard from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on when and how much revenue to recognize when another party (an agent), along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or a service to a customer. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications. 
  In May 2016, the FASB rescinded several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in ASC 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services.

     Table of Contents  

The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the potential impact on its financial position and results of operations of adopting this guidance.  
  Inventory 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This standard is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
  Financial Instrument Accounting 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard that amends certain aspects of accounting and disclosure requirements of financial instruments, including the requirement that equity investments with readily determinable fair values be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in our results of operations. The new standard does not apply to investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values may be measured at fair value or at cost minus impairment adjusted for changes in observable prices. A financial liability that is measured at fair value in accordance with the fair value option is required to be presented separately in Other Comprehensive Income for the portion of the total change in the fair value resulting from change in the instrument-specific credit risk. In addition, a valuation allowance should be evaluated on deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. The new standard will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the potential impact on its financial position and results of operations of adopting this guidance. 
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that will require the recognition of all lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees and sets forth new disclosure requirements for those lease assets and liabilities. The standard requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. This standard is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its financial position and results of operations of adopting this guidance. 
  Share-Based Payment Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a new standard that requires recognition of the income tax effects of vested or settled awards in the income statement and involves several other aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and potential impact on its financial position, results of operations and statement of cash flow of adopting this guidance. 
  Statement of Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to reduce diversity in practice regarding how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This amendment is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

    Business Combinations 
     Combination with Baxalta 
  On June 3, 2016, Shire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Baxalta for   $18.00   per share in cash and   0.1482   Shire American Depository Shares ( ADSs ) per Baxalta share, or if a former Baxalta shareholder properly elected,   0.4446   Shire ordinary shares per Baxalta share.  
  Baxalta was a global biopharmaceutical company that focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing therapies for orphan diseases and underserved conditions in hematology, oncology and immunology.  
  The preliminary fair value of the purchase price consideration consisted of the following:  

The acquisition of Baxalta was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. Shire issued   305.2 million   shares to former Baxalta shareholders at the date of the acquisition. For a more detailed description of the fair value of the partially vested stock options and RSUs assumed, please see Note 22, Share-based compensation plans, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Baxalta have been recorded at their preliminary fair value as of June 3, 2016, the date of acquisition. The Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included the results of Baxalta from the date of acquisition. The amount of Baxalta s post-acquisition revenues included in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is   $1,586.4 million   and   $2,166.7 million  , respectively. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company began integrating Baxalta and as such the combined business is now sharing various research and development and selling, general and administrative functions. As a result, computing a separate measure of Baxalta s stand-alone profitability for periods after the acquisition date is not practical.

The Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including measurement period adjustments identified during the three months ended September 30, 2016, is outlined below. 

The measurement period adjustments for Other intangible assets reflect changes in the estimated fair value of Currently marketed products and IPR D. The measurement period adjustments for Property, plant and equipment ("PP E") primarily reflect changes in the estimated fair value of acquired buildings, machinery and equipment. The changes in the estimated fair values for Other intangible assets and PP E are primarily to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. The measurement period adjustments did not result from intervening events subsequent to the acquisition date. 
  The Company is currently completing its evaluation of information, assumptions and valuation methodologies it used in its preliminary fair value of the purchase price consideration.  The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , certain items related to the fair values of inventories, intangible assets, PP E, other current and non-current liabilities and current and deferred taxes have not been finalized and may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized. The finalization of these matters may result in changes to the underlying assets, liabilities

     Table of Contents  

and goodwill. These changes may be material. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date. 
  Intangible Assets 
  The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated using an income approach, which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the incremental after tax cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. 
  Currently marketed products totaling   $24,150.0 million   relate to intellectual property ( IP ) rights acquired for Baxalta s currently marketed products. The estimated useful life of the intangible assets related to currently marketed products range from   11   to   38   years (weighted average   30   years), with amortization being recorded on a straight line basis. 
  IPR D intangible assets totaling   $1,480.0 million   represent the value assigned to research and development ("R D")  projects acquired. The IPR D intangible assets are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project, the Company will make a separate determination of the estimated useful life of the IPR D intangible asset and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life.  
  Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R D costs, selling and marketing costs, working capital/asset contributory asset charges and other cash flow assumptions), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset s life cycle, the potential regulatory and commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream as well as other factors. 
  The discount rate used to arrive at the present value at the acquisition date of the IPR D intangible assets was   10.0%   to reflect the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill of   $8,001.0 million  , which is not deductible for tax purposes, includes the expected synergies that will result from combining the operations of Baxalta with Shire; intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition at the time of the acquisition; the value of the assembled workforce; and impacted by establishing a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable intangible assets which have no tax basis. 
  In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company expensed   $254.1 million   and   $696.4 million  , respectively, relating to the acquisition and integration of Baxalta, which have been recorded within Integration and Acquisition costs in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Contingent Consideration 
  The Company acquired certain contingent obligations classified as contingent consideration related to Baxalta s historical business combinations. Additional consideration is conditionally due upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development, regulatory, first commercial sale and other sales milestones, which could total up to approximately   $1.5 billion  . The Company may also pay royalties based on certain product sales. The Company estimated the fair value of the assumed contingent consideration to be   $161.0 million   using a probability weighting approach that considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount rates matched to the timing of first payment, and probability of success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows.  
  Retirement plans  
  The Company assumed pension plans as part of the acquisition of Baxalta, including defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans in the United States and foreign jurisdictions which had a net liability balance of   $610.4 million  . As of June 3, 2016, the Baxalta defined benefit pension plans had assets with a fair value of   $358.5 million  .

Supplemental disclosure of pro forma information    
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of the operations of Shire and Baxalta as if the acquisition of Baxalta had occurred as of January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the respective acquisitions been completed on January 1, 2015. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future results of operations of the combined Company. 

The unaudited pro forma financial information above reflects the following pro forma adjustments:  
           (i) 
    an adjustment to increase net income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   by   $562.6 million   to eliminate integration and acquisition related costs incurred by Shire and Baxalta and a corresponding decrease in net income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   by   $562.6 million   to give effect to the integration and acquisition of Baxalta as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015; 
              (ii) 
    an adjustment to increase net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by   $873.6 million   and a corresponding decrease in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 by   $592.5 million   and   $1,777.5 million  , respectively, to reflect amortization of the fair value adjustments for inventory as inventory is sold; 
               (iv) 
    an adjustment to decrease net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by   $97.2 million   and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 by   $64.0 million   and   $215.1 million  , respectively, primarily related to the additional interest expense associated with the debt incurred to partially fund the acquisition of Baxalta and the amortization of related deferred debt issuance costs. 
     The adjustments above are stated net of their tax effects, where applicable.  
  Acquisition of Dyax 
  On January 22, 2016, Shire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Dyax for   $37.30   per share in cash. Under the terms of the merger agreement, former Dyax shareholders may receive additional value through a non-tradable contingent value right worth   $4.00   per share, payable upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval of SHP643 (formerly DX-2930) in Hereditary Angioedema ( HAE ). 
  Dyax was a publicly-traded, Massachusetts-based rare disease biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of plasma kallikrein ( pKal ) inhibitors for the treatment of HAE. Dyax s most advanced clinical program was SHP643, a Phase 3 program with the potential for improved efficacy and convenience for HAE patients. SHP643 has received Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Orphan Drug Designations by the FDA and has also received Orphan Drug status in the EU. Dyax s sole marketed product, KALBITOR, is a pKal inhibitor for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE in patients 12 years of age and older.

     Table of Contents  

The acquisition of Dyax was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. The preliminary acquisition-date fair value consideration was   $6,330.0 million  , comprising cash paid on closing of   $5,934.0 million   and the preliminary fair value of the contingent value right of   $396.0 million   (maximum payable   $646.0 million  ). The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Dyax have been recorded at their preliminary fair value as of January 22, 2016, the date of acquisition. The Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of Dyax as of January 22, 2016. The amount of Dyax s post-acquisition revenues included in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is   $16.7 million   and   $51.3 million  , respectively. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company began integrating Dyax and as such the combined business is now sharing various research and development and selling, general and administrative functions. As a result, computing a separate measure of Dyax's stand-alone profitability for periods after the acquisition date is not practical. 
  In the third quarter of   2016  , the Company adjusted its preliminary valuation and allocation of purchase price consideration. The adjustment, which was not material, decreased goodwill and deferred tax liabilities. The revised preliminary allocation of the total purchase price is as follows: 

The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities. In particular, intangible assets and current and deferred taxes are preliminary pending receipt of the final valuations for those items. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. 
  Currently marketed products 
  Currently marketed products totaling   $135.0 million   relate to intellectual property rights acquired for KALBITOR. The fair value of the currently marketed product has been estimated using an income approach, based on the present value of incremental after tax cash flows attributable to KALBITOR. 
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

The estimated useful life of the KALBITOR intangible asset is   18   years, with amortization being recorded on a straight-line basis.  
  IPR D    
  The IPR D asset of   $4,100.0 million   relates to Dyax s clinical program SHP643, a Phase 3 program with the potential for improved efficacy and convenience for HAE patients. The IPR D intangible asset is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. The fair value of this IPR D asset was estimated based on an income approach, using the present value of incremental after tax cash flows expected to be generated by this development project. The estimated cash flows have been probability adjusted to take into account the development stage of completion and the remaining risks and uncertainties surrounding the future development and commercialization.  
  The estimated probability adjusted after tax cash flows used to estimate the fair value of other intangible assets have been discounted at   9%  .  
  Royalty rights    
  Other intangible assets totaling   $425.0 million   relate to royalty rights arising from licensing agreements of a portfolio of product candidates. This portfolio includes two approved products, marketed by Eli Lilly   Company, and various development-stage products. Multiple product candidates with other pharmaceutical companies are in various stages of clinical development for which the Company is eligible to receive future royalties and/or milestone payments.  
  The fair value of these royalty rights is preliminary and has been estimated using an income approach, based on the present value of incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to each royalty right.   
  The estimated useful lives of these royalty rights range from   seven   to   nine   years (weighted average   eight   years), with amortization being recorded on a straight-line basis. 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill of   $2,688.8 million  , which is not deductible for tax purposes, includes the expected synergies that will result from combining the operations of Dyax with Shire; intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition at the time of the acquisition; the value of the assembled workforce; and impacted by establishing a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable intangible assets which have no tax basis.  
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company expensed   $11.3 million   and   $65.0 million  , respectively, relating to the acquisition and integration of Dyax, which have been recorded within Integration and Acquisition costs in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.

     The adjustments above are stated net of their tax effects, where applicable. 
  Acquisition of NPS 
  On February 21, 2015, Shire completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of NPS. As of the acquisition date, fair value of the cash consideration paid on closing was   $5,219.6 million  . 
  The acquisition of NPS added GATTEX/REVESTIVE and NATPARA/NATPAR to Shire s portfolio of currently marketed products. GATTEX/REVESTIVE is approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) who are dependent on parenteral support, a rare and potentially fatal gastrointestinal disorder. NATPARA/NATPAR is approved in the U.S. and indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism ( HPT ), a rare endocrine disease. 
  The acquisition of NPS was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from NPS have been recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, February 21, 2015.

Currently marketed products 
  Currently marketed products totaling   $4,640.0 million   relate to intellectual property rights of NATPARA/NATPAR and GATTEX/REVESTIVE. The fair value of the currently marketed products has been estimated using an income approach, based on the present value of incremental after tax cash flows attributable to each separately identifiable intangible asset. 
  The estimated useful lives of the NATPARA/NATPAR and GATTEX/REVESTIVE intangible assets are   24   years, with amortization being recorded on a straight-line basis. 
  Royalty rights 
  Other intangible assets totaling   $353.0 million   relate to the royalty rights arising from the collaboration agreements with Amgen Inc ( Amgen ), Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. ( Janssen ) and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd ( Kyowa Hakko Kirin ). Amgen markets cinacalcet HCl as Sensipar in the U.S. and as Mimpara in the EU; Janssen markets tapentadol as Nucynta in the U.S.; and Kyowa Hakko Kirin markets cinacalcet HCI as Regpara in Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan. From the acquisition of NPS, the Company is entitled to royalties from the net sales of these products. 
  The fair value of these royalty rights has been estimated using an income approach, based on the present value of incremental after tax cash flows attributable to each royalty right.

  Coherus Biosciences, Inc. 
  In June 2016, the Company acquired a license agreement with Coherus Biosciences, Inc. ( Coherus ) to develop and commercialize a biosimilar to ENBREL  (etanercept). The Company acquired the agreement through the acquisition of Baxalta, which previously entered into the agreement in August 2013. The Company also obtained the right of first refusal to certain other biosimilars in the collaboration. Under the terms of the agreement, Coherus was responsible for the development plan, preparation of regulatory filings, and manufacture of the product, subject to certain cost reimbursement by the Company. In September 2016, the Company terminated the licensing agreement with Coherus in accordance with its terms. 
  Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  In June 2016, the Company acquired an exclusive license agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Momenta ) to develop and commercialize biosimilars, including adalimumab (BAX 2923), a biosimilar product candidate for HUMIRA  (adalimumab). The agreement was acquired through the acquisition of Baxalta, which initially entered into the agreement in February 2012. The arrangement includes specified funding by the Company, as well as other responsibilities, relating to development and commercialization activities. In September 2016, the Company exercised its right to terminate its license agreement with Momenta.  The effective date of the termination is twelve months from the date that Momenta received the Company s written notice of termination.  Prior to the effective date of the termination, the Company and Momenta are required to satisfy certain ongoing obligations.  
  Pfizer Inc. 
  In July 2016, the Company licensed the global rights to all indications for SHP647 from Pfizer Inc. SHP647 is an investigational biologic being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer received an upfront payment of   $90 million  , and is eligible to receive between   $75 million   to   $460 million   in milestone payments based on clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones and low double-digit royalties on any potential sales if the product is approved.  
  Other arrangements 
  SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group 
  In June 2015, Baxalta entered into a co-development agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals IX, L.P., a SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group company ( SFJ ) relating to BAX 2923, whereby SFJ would fund specified development costs related to the BAX 2923 program, in exchange for payments in the event the product obtains regulatory approval in the United States and Europe. There were certain termination provisions that could have triggered payment of the contingent success payments prior to regulatory approval.  
  The preliminary fair value of the assumed contingency was recorded as a long-term liability at June 3, 2016 and as of the balance sheet date, as part of Company s purchase accounting for the Baxalta acquisition. The fair value of the assumed contingency on the date of acquisition was   $288.6 million  .

As part of the Company s activities to integrate Baxalta, it terminated certain employees and announced plans to close certain offices. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred costs relating to employee termination benefits of   $120.0 million   and   $373.1 million  , respectively, including severance and acceleration of stock compensation. The Baxalta integration activities are ongoing and the Company is continuing to evaluate the total costs expected to be incurred and the time-frame.  
  The following table summarizes the employee termination related reserve as of   September 30, 2016   : 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , Shire recorded integration and acquisition costs of   $89.9 million   of which   $30.7 million   related to the acquisition and integration of NPS, Viropharma and charges related to the acquisition of Baxalta.  Additionally, Shire recorded   $59.2 million   in charges related to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in relation to the acquisition of Lumena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Lumena ), following the agreement to settle all future contingent milestones payable to former Lumena shareholders through a one-time   $90 million   payment. 
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , Shire recorded a net credit to integration and acquisition costs of    $46.8 million  . The net credit principally comprises costs related to the acquisition and integration of NPS, Viropharma and preliminary work on the proposed combination with Baxalta totaling   $149.7 million   offset by a net credit relating to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of   $196.5 million  . The change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities relates to the acquisition of Lumena and Lotus Tissue Repair Inc. The Lumena contingent consideration decreased as the  probability of success for the SHP625 asset (for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases) decreased following the receipt of data from certain Phase 2 studies and  the agreement in the third quarter of 2015 to settle all future contingent milestones payable to former Lumena shareholders. The contingent consideration from the Lotus Tissue Repair acquisition decreased as the probability of success for the SHP608 asset (for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( DEB )) decreased upon receiving certain preclinical toxicity findings.

    Fair Value Measurement 
     Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the following financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level 2); and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

30 

     Table of Contents  

Marketable equity securities are included within Investments in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contingent consideration receivable is included within Prepaid expenses and Other current assets and Other non-current assets in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contingent consideration payable is included within Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. For a discussion of the Company's derivative arrangements, see Note 13, Financial Instruments, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The estimated fair value amounts shown above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.  
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument: 
             
    Marketable equity securities: the fair values of marketable equity securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments. 
                
    Marketable debt securities: the fair values of debt securities are obtained from pricing services or broker/dealers who either use quoted prices in an active market or proprietary pricing applications, which include observable market information for like or same securities. 
                
    Contingent consideration receivable: the fair value of the contingent consideration receivable has been estimated using the income approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method). 
                
    Derivative contracts: the fair values of the swap and forward foreign exchange contracts have been determined using the month-end interest rate and foreign exchange rates, respectively. 
                
    Contingent consideration payable: the fair value of the contingent consideration payable has been estimated using the income approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method). 
     Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) 
  The following table provides a roll forward of the fair values of our contingent consideration receivable and payables which include Level 3 measurements: 

31 

     Table of Contents  

The increase in contingent consideration payable is primarily related to the Company s acquisition of Dyax as well as contingent consideration payable assumed in the acquisition of Baxalta. Other primarily includes foreign currency adjustments.  
  Of the   $996.7 million   of contingent consideration payable as of September 30, 2016,   $48.0 million   is recorded within Other current liabilities and   $948.7 million   is recorded within Other non-current liabilities in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contingent consideration payable represents future milestones and royalties the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with various business combinations and license agreements.  
  The fair value of the Company s contingent consideration receivable and payable could significantly increase or decrease due to changes in certain assumptions which underpin the fair value measurements. Each set of assumptions is specific to the individual contingent consideration receivable or payable. 
  Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

The estimated fair values of long-term debt were based upon recent observable market prices and are considered level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value of capital lease obligations is based on Level 2 inputs.  
  The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities approximate their estimated fair value due to their short-term nature, such as liquidity and maturity of these amounts, or because there have been no significant changes since the asset or liability was last re-measured to fair value on a non-recurring basis. 
   
           13. 
    Financial Instruments 
     Foreign Currency Contracts 
  Due to the global nature of our operations, portions of the Company s revenues and operating expenses are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The value of revenues and operating expenses measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to mitigate these changes, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to lock in exchange rates associated with a portion of its forecasted international revenues and operating expenses. The main trading currencies of the Company are the U.S. dollar, Euro, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Franc, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen. 
  Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. It is the Company s policy that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the subsidiary s functional currency. Where significant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts (spot, forward and swap contracts) to manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.  
  The Company has master netting agreements with a number of counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts and on the occurrence of specified events, the Company has the ability to terminate contracts and settle them with a net payment by one party to the other. The Company has elected to present derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company does not have credit risk related contingent features or collateral linked to the derivatives. 
  Designated Derivative Instruments 
  In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta, the Company assumed foreign currency forward contracts and elected to apply hedge accounting. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in AOCI. Realized gains and losses for the effective portion of such contracts are recognized in revenue or cost of sales when the sale of product in the currency being hedged is recognized. To the extent ineffective, hedge transaction gains and losses are reported in Other income/(expense), net. The amount of ineffectiveness for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was immaterial. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the foreign currency forward contracts had a total notional value of   $350.0 million   with a maximum duration of nine months. The Company did not have any designated forward contracts as of December 31, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of   $3.3 million   (2015:   nil  ) presented within accounts payable and accrued expenses. The portion of the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts that was included in AOCI in total equity reflected net losses of   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company expects all contracts to be settled over the next nine months and any amounts in AOCI to be reported as an adjustment to revenue or cost of sales. The Company considers the impact of its and its counterparties  credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its contractual obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , credit risk did not change the fair value of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts. 
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Undesignated Derivative Instruments 
  The Company uses forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk related to certain balance sheet positions, including intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The Company has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative instruments as the duration of these contracts is typically three months or less.  The changes in fair value of these derivatives are reported in earnings. The notional amount of undesignated derivative instruments was   $508.8 million   and   $639.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  The Company also has option contracts assumed from Baxalta that were previously designated as cash flow hedges. The notional amount of these option contracts totaled   $26.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Upon acquisition, the Company did not elect to redesignate these option contracts as cash flow hedges. In addition, the company also assumed undesignated forward contracts from Baxalta. The notional amount of these undesignated forward contracts totaled   $659.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of   $2.0 million   (2015:   nil  ) presented within accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
  Interest Rate Contracts 
  The Company is exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in benchmark interest rates relating to its debt obligations on which interest is set at floating rates. The Company s policy is to manage this risk to an acceptable level. The Company is principally exposed to interest rate risk on any borrowings under the Company s various debt facilities and on part of the senior notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of Baxalta. Interest on each of these debt obligations is set at fixed and/or floating rates, to the extent utilized. Shire s exposure under these facilities is to changes in U.S. dollar interest rates. For further details related to interest rates on the Company s various debt facilities, see Note 14, Borrowings and capital lease obligations, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Designated Derivative Instruments 
  In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta, the Company assumed interest rate swap contracts on certain borrowing transactions. These interest rate swap contracts were related to the issuance of Baxalta s Senior Notes with an aggregate notional amount of   $1.0 billion  , mature in June 2020 and June 2025. Subsequent to the acquisition of Baxalta, the Company redesignated these interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges, based on their contractual terms, economic conditions, historic operating or accounting policies, and other conditions that existed at the acquisition date. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts are recorded as a component of the senior notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of Baxalta with the ineffective portion recorded in income. Any net interest payments made or received on the interest rate swap contracts are recognized as a component of interest expense in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further details related to Baxalta s Senior Notes, please see Note 14, Borrowings and capital lease obligations, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of these contracts was   $43.7 million   (2015: $  nil  ) presented within other non-current assets. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $2.1 million   (2015: $  nil  ) of gain related to these contracts, which was recognized as a component of interest expense. 
  Undesignated Derivative Instruments 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of   $5.1 billion   related to the November 2015 Facilities Agreement.  The Company has not elected hedge accounting for these contracts. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of these contracts was   $1.1 million   (2015: $  nil  ), which is presented within other current liabilities.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $1.1 million   (2015: $  nil  ) loss related to these contracts, which was recognized as a component of interest expense. 
  The following tables summarize the income statement locations and gains and losses on the Company s designated and undesignated derivative instruments for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . There were no designated derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had in total   270   swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.

  Senior Notes Issuance 
  On September 23, 2016, Shire Acquisitions Investments Ireland Designated Activity Company ("SAIIDAC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued senior notes pursuant to a public offering with a total aggregate principal value of   $12.1 billion   ( SAIIDAC Notes ), guaranteed by Shire plc.  SAIIDAC used the net proceeds to fully repay amounts outstanding under the January 2016 Facilities Agreement (discussed below), which was used to finance the cash consideration payable related to the Company s acquisition of Baxalta. Below is a summary of the SAIIDAC Notes as of September 30, 2016: 

37 

     Table of Contents  

The SAIIDAC Notes are senior unsecured obligations and may be redeemed at the Company's option at the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the applicable treasury rate (as defined) plus an incremental margin, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest. The SAIIDAC Notes also contain a change of control provision that may require that the Company offer to purchase the SAIIDAC Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase under certain circumstances. 
    
  The costs associated with this offering of approximately $  62.7 million   have been recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs will be amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the period from issuance through maturity. The discounts will be amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity using the effective interest rate method. Interest on the SAIIDAC Notes is payable March 23 and September 23 of each year, beginning on March 23, 2017. 
  Baxalta Senior Notes Guaranteed by Shire

January 2016 Facilities Agreement 
  On   January 11, 2016  , Shire entered into an   $18.0 billion   bridge facilities agreement (the  January 2016 Facilities Agreement ). The January 2016 Facilities Agreement comprised   two   credit facilities: (i) a   $13.0 billion   term loan facility originally maturing on   January 11, 2017   ("January 2016 Facility A") and (ii) a   $5.0 billion   revolving loan facility originally maturing on January 11, 2017 ("January 2016 Facility B"). 
  January 2016 Facility A was utilized to finance the cash consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of Baxalta on June 3, 2016 in the amount of   $12,390.0 million  .  The Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of the SAIIDAC Notes to fully repay the amounts outstanding under January 2016 Facility A. 
  January 2016 Facility B was canceled effective   July 11, 2016  , in accordance with its terms. 
  November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
  On   November 2, 2015  , Shire entered into a   $5.6 billion   facilities agreement (the  November 2015 Facilities Agreement ).  The November 2015 Facilities Agreement comprises   three   credit facilities: (i) a   $1.0 billion   term loan facility of which, following the exercise of the one year extension option in the amount of   $400.0 million  ,   $600.0 million   matures on   November 2, 2016   and   $400.0 million   matures on   November 2, 2017   ( November 2015 Facility A ), (ii) a   $2.2 billion   amortizing term loan facility which matures on   November 2, 2017   ( November 2015 Facility B ) and (iii) a   $2.4 billion   amortizing term loan facility which matures on   November 2, 2018   ( November 2015 Facility C ). 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the November 2015 Facilities Agreement was fully utilized to finance the cash consideration payable and certain costs related to the acquisition of Dyax. 
  January 2015 Facilities Agreement 
  On   January 11, 2015  , Shire entered into an   $850 million   term facilities agreement with, among others, Citigroup Global Markets Limited acting as mandated lead arranger and bookrunner (the  January 2015 Facilities Agreement ) with an original maturity date of   January 10, 2016  . The maturity date was subsequently extended to   July 11, 2016   in line with the provisions within the January 2015 Facilities Agreement allowing the maturity date to be extended twice, at Shire s option, by six months on each occasion. The January 2015 Facilities Agreement was utilized to finance the purchase price paid in respect of Shire s acquisition of NPS (including certain related costs). On September 28, 2015, the Company reduced the January 2015 Facilities Agreement by   $100 million  . In January 2016 and at various points thereafter, the Company canceled parts of the January 2015 Facilities Agreement. On   February 22, 2016  , the Company repaid the remaining balance of   $100 million   of the January 2015 Facilities Agreement in full.  
  Short-term uncommitted lines of credit ( Credit lines )    
  Shire has access to various Credit lines from a number of banks which provide flexibility to short-term cash management procedures. These Credit lines can be withdrawn by the banks at any time. The Credit lines are not relied upon for core liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , these Credit lines were not utilized. 
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  The Company assumed certain capital lease obligations related to the Baxalta acquisition. These leases are primarily related to office and manufacturing facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total capital lease obligations, including current portions, was   $348.6 million  .

    Retirement and Other Benefit Programs 
     As part of the acquisition of Baxalta, the Company assumed certain pension and other post-employment benefit ( OPEB ) plan obligations and plan assets. The following is a summary of the fair value of the pension and OPEB-related balances assumed as of June 3, 2016, the acquisition date. 

The Company did not assume any gains or losses deferred in AOCI. 
  Accumulated Benefit Obligation Information 
  The pension obligation information in the table above represents the projected benefit obligation ( PBO ) assumed as of June 3, 2016. The PBO incorporates assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO ) is the same as the PBO except that it includes no assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The ABO for all of the Company s U.S. pension plans was   $369.2 million   as of June 3, 2016. The ABO for all of the Company s International pension plans was   $386.8 million   as of June 3, 2016. 
  The information in the funded status table above represents the totals for all of the Company s pension plans. The following is information relating to the individual plans as of June 3, 2016 in the funded status table above that have an ABO in excess of plan assets. 

Expected Net Pension and OPEB Plan Payments for the Next 10 Years

     Table of Contents  

The expected net benefit payments above reflected the Company s share of the total net benefits expected to be paid from the plans  assets (for funded plans) or from the Company s assets (for unfunded plans) as of June 3, 2016. The federal subsidies relating to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act are not expected to be significant.  
  Weighted-Average Assumptions Used in Determining Benefit Obligations at the Measurement Date and Net Periodic Benefit Cost 

The assumptions above, which were used in calculating the June 3, 2016 measurement date benefit obligations, are used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016 along with the expected return on plan asset assumption. The Company establishes the expected return on plan assets assumption primarily based on a review of historical compound average asset returns, both Company-specific and relating to the broad market (based on the Company s asset allocation), as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations. The Company is using weighted-average assumptions of   7.0%   and   4.5%   for its U.S. and International funded plans, respectively, in its calculation of net period benefit cost in 2016. 
  Pension Plan Assets 
  A committee of members of senior management is responsible for supervising, monitoring and evaluating the invested assets of the Company s funded pension plans. The committee abides by policies and procedures relating to investment goals, targeted asset allocations, risk management practices, allowable and prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations, and other relevant factors and considerations. In the United States, Goldman Sachs Asset Management acts as an outsourced chief investment officer ( oCIO ) to perform the day-to-day management of pension assets. 
  The policies and procedures include the following: 
             
    Ability to pay all benefits when due; 
                
    Targeted long-term performance expectations relative to applicable market indices, such as Standard   Poor s, Russell, MSCI EAFE, and other indices; 
                
    Targeted asset allocation percentage ranges (summarized below), and periodic reviews of these allocations; 
                
    Specified investment holding and transaction prohibitions (for example, private placements or other restricted securities, securities that are not traded in a sufficiently active market, short sales, certain derivatives, commodities and margin transactions); 
                
    Specified portfolio percentage limits on holdings in a single corporate or other entity (generally   5%  , except for holdings in U.S. government or agency securities); 
                
    Specified average credit quality for the fixed-income securities portfolio (at least A- by Standard   Poor s or A3 by Moody s); 
                
    Specified portfolio percentage limits on foreign holdings; and 
                
    Periodic monitoring of oCIO performance and adherence to policies.

     Table of Contents  

Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and exceed the planned benchmark investment return. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities, the plans  funded status and other factors, such as the plans  demographics and liability durations. Investment performance is reviewed on a quarterly basis and asset allocations are reviewed at least annually. 
  Plan assets are managed in a balanced equity and fixed income portfolio. The target allocations for plan assets are   75 percent   in an equity portfolio and   25 percent   in a fixed income portfolio. The documented policy includes an allocation range based on each individual investment type within the major portfolios that allows for a variance from the target allocations of approximately   5%  . The equity portfolio may include common stock of U.S. and international companies, common/collective trust funds, mutual funds, hedge funds and real asset investments. The fixed income portfolio may include cash, money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less, U.S. and foreign government and governmental agency issues, common/collective trust funds, corporate bonds, municipal securities, derivative contracts and asset-backed securities. 
  While the committee provides oversight over plan assets for U.S. and international plans, the summary above is specific to the plans in the U.S. The plan assets for international plans are managed and allocated by the entities in each country, with input and oversight provided by the committee. 
  The following pension assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level 2); and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

*Investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share or its equivalent as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy.  
  The following tables summarize the bases used to measure the pension plan assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis for the international funded plans.

*Investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share or its equivalent as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy.  
  The assets and liabilities of the Company s pension plans are valued using the following valuation methods: 
                 Investment category 
    Valuation methodology 
      Cash and cash equivalents 
    These largely consist of a short-term investment fund, U.S. dollars and foreign currency. The fair value of the short-term investment fund is based on the net asset value 
      Government agency issues 
    Values are based on quoted prices in an active market 
      Corporate bonds 
    Values are based on the valuation date in an active market 
      Common stock 
    Values are based on the closing prices on the valuation date in an active market on national and international stock exchanges 
      Mutual funds 
    Values are based on the net asset value of the units held in the respective fund which are obtained from national and international exchanges or as reported by the fund managers 
      Collective trust funds and hedge funds 
    Values are based on the net asset value of the units held at year end 
      Real estate funds 
    The value of these assets are either determined by the net asset value of the units held in the respective fund which are obtained from national and international exchanges or based on the net asset value of the underlying assets of the fund provided by the fund manager 
      Other holdings 
    The value of these assets vary by investment type and are primarily based on reputable pricing vendors that typically use pricing matrices or models

Expected Pension and OPEB Plan Funding    
  The Company s funding policy for its pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the Company, and other factors. Volatility in the global financial markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding requirements. The Company has no obligation to fund its principal plans in the U.S. in 2016.  The Company made cash contributions to its international plans of approximately   $4 million   from the June 3, 2016 acquisition date through September 30, 2016. The Company did not make any significant voluntary contributions to its U.S. Qualified plan from the June 3, 2016 acquisition date through September 30, 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of at least   $1 million  , primarily related to its international plans, and expects to have net cash outflows relating to its OPEB plan of less than   $1 million  . The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions, which could be significant in any period. 
  The table below details the funded status percentage of the Company s assumed pension plans from Baxalta as of the acquisition date, including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the guidelines of the Company s funding policy outlined above.

The following table reconciles net income and loss and the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented: 

Weighted average number of basic shares excludes shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and those under the shares buy-back program, which are both presented by Shire as treasury stock. Share-based awards to employees are calculated using the treasury method.  
  The share equivalents not included in the calculation of the diluted weighted average number of shares are shown below: 

Certain stock options have been excluded from the calculation of diluted Earnings per Share ( EPS ) for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   because either their exercise prices exceeded Shire s average share price during the calculation period or the required performance conditions were not satisfied as of the balance sheet date.  
  Stock options for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the inclusion of these shares would have been antidilutive. 

For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was   38%   (2015:   -5%  ) and   246%   (2015:   -1%  ), respectively. 
  The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is affected by the combined impact of the relative quantum of the profit before tax for the period by jurisdiction and of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities from the Baxalta acquisition (including in higher tax territories     such as the U.S.) of inventory and intangible assets amortization as well as significant acquisition and integration costs. 
  The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was negative primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances, the effect of the finalization of various tax returns and the re-measurement of uncertain tax positions relating to ongoing tax audits all recognized during the third quarter of 2015. 
  The Company has historically calculated the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to ordinary income or loss for the reporting period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the impact of certain items arising from the Baxalta acquisition has caused significant variations in the estimated effective tax rate. As a result, the Company has applied a permitted

  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had committed to pay approximately   $1,202 million   (December 31, 2015:   $490 million  ) to contract vendors for administering and executing clinical trials. The timing of these payments is dependent upon actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. 
  Contract manufacturing

Investment commitments 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding commitments to purchase common stock and interests in companies and partnerships, respectively, for amounts totaling   $70 million   (December 31, 2015:   $22 million  ) which may all be payable in 2016, depending on the timing of capital calls. The investment commitments include additional funding to certain variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which Shire is not the primary beneficiary. 
  Capital commitments 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had committed to spend   $130 million   (December 31, 2015:   $60 million  ) on capital projects. 
  Baxter related tax indemnification 
  Baxter International Inc. ("Baxter") and Baxalta entered into a tax matters agreement, effective on the date of Baxalta s separation from Baxter, which employs a direct tracing approach, or where direct tracing approach is not feasible, an allocation methodology, to determine which company is liable for pre-separation income tax items for U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions.  With respect to tax liabilities that are directly traceable or allocated to Baxalta but for which Baxalta was not the primary obligor, Baxalta recorded a tax indemnification amount that would be due to Baxter upon Baxter discharging the associated tax liability to the taxing authority.  At   September 30, 2016  , the amount of the net tax indemnification amount was   $42.2 million  . 
   
           21. 
    Legal and other proceedings 
     The Company expenses legal costs when incurred. 
  The Company recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. When the estimated loss lies within a range, the Company records a loss contingency provision based on its best estimate of the probable loss. If no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded.  Estimates of losses may be developed before the ultimate loss is known, and are therefore refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. An outcome that deviates from the Company s estimate may result in an additional expense or release in a future accounting period. As of September 30, 2016, provision for litigation losses, insurance claims and other disputes totaled   $399.7 million   (December 31, 2015:   $9.9 million  ). 
  The Company s principal pending legal and other proceedings are disclosed below. The outcomes of these proceedings are not always predictable and can be affected by various factors. For those legal and other proceedings for which it is considered at least reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred, the Company discloses the possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the recorded loss contingency provision, if any, where such excess is both material and estimable. 
  VYVANSE 
  In May and June 2011, Shire was notified that six separate Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") were submitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market generic versions of all approved strengths of VYVANSE. The notices were from Sandoz, Inc. ("Sandoz"); Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC ("Amneal"); Watson Laboratories, Inc.; Roxane Laboratories, Inc. ("Roxane"); Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Mylan  and Actavis Elizabeth LLC and Actavis Inc. (collectively, "Actavis"). Since filing suit against these ANDA filers, along with API suppliers Johnson Matthey Inc. and Johnson Matthey Pharmaceuticals Materials (collectively,  Johnson Matthey ), Shire has been engaged in a consolidated patent infringement litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the aforementioned parties (except Watson, who withdrew their ANDA). 
  On June 23, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey granted Shire s summary judgment motion holding that 18 claims of the patents-in-suit were both infringed and valid. On September 24, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) affirmed that ruling against all of the ANDA filers and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.  The CAFC ruling overturned the infringement ruling against Johnson Matthey and the case against Johnson Matthey has been dismissed.  Following remand to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the case has been fully resolved as a result of the Stipulation of Dismissal and Final Judgment entered by the court on August 30, 2016 in which the court imposed an injunction preventing all of the ANDA filers (Sandoz,  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

Roxane, Amneal, Actavis and Mylan) from launching generic versions of VYVANSE until the expiration of these patents in 2023. 
  In March, April and May 2016, Shire received Notices of Allegation ( NOA ) from Apotex Inc. ( Apotex ) informing Shire that Apotex filed an Abbreviated New Drug Submission ( ANDS ) with Health Canada seeking approval to market a generic version of VYVANSE in Canada.  Within the requisite 45 days, Shire filed for orders of prohibition and, as a result, a 24-month stay of approval of the ANDS has been put into effect.  Apotex has withdrawn the first two NOAs. On July 4, 2016, Apotex filed a Statement of Claim in Federal Court seeking a judicial declaration of invalidity and noninfringement of Shire s Canadian patent relating to VYVANSE which Shire is actively defending. 
  On April 14, 2016, Shire prevailed in upholding its European patent for ELVANSE. Shire initially prevailed in an opposition to its patent lodged by Johnson Matthey plc, Generics [UK] Limited (trading as Mylan) and Hexal AG and on April 14, 2016 Shire prevailed in the appeal. The decision by the appeals board of the European Patent Office is final and cannot be further appealed. 
  LIALDA 
  In May 2010, Shire was notified that Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ( Zydus ) had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus and Cadila Healthcare Limited, doing business as Zydus Cadila. A Markman hearing took place on January 29, 2015 and a Markman ruling was issued on July 28, 2015. A trial took place between March 28, 2016 and April 1, 2016.  On September 16, 2016 the court issued its ruling finding that the proposed generic product would not infringe the asserted claims.  Shire has appealed the ruling to the CAFC. 
  In February 2012, Shire was notified that Osmotica Pharmaceutical Corporation ( Osmotica ) had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Osmotica. A Markman hearing took place on August 22, 2013 and a Markman ruling was issued on September 25, 2014. The court issued an Order on February 27, 2015 in which all dates in the scheduling order have been stayed. 
  In March 2012, Shire was notified that Watson Laboratories Inc.-Florida had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Watson Laboratories Inc.-Florida and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Watson Pharma, Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. (collectively,  Watson ) were subsequently added as defendants. A trial took place in April 2013 and on May 9, 2013 the trial court issued a decision finding that the proposed generic product infringes the patent-in-suit and that the patent is not invalid. Watson appealed the trial court s ruling to the CAFC and a hearing took place on December 2, 2013. The ruling of the CAFC was issued on March 28, 2014 overruling the trial court on the interpretation of two claim terms and remanding the case for further proceedings. Shire petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari which was granted on January 26, 2015. The Supreme Court also vacated the CAFC decision and remanded the case to the CAFC for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court s recent decision in Teva v. Sandoz. On June 3, 2015, the CAFC reaffirmed their previous decision to reverse the District Court s claims construction and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. A trial was held on January 25-27, 2016. A ruling was issued on March 28, 2016 upholding the validity of the patent and finding that Watson s proposed ANDA product infringes the patent-in-suit. Watson appealed the ruling to the CAFC and oral argument took place on October 5, 2016. 
  In April 2012, Shire was notified that Mylan had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA.

  Investigation related to DERMAGRAFT 
  The Department of Justice, including the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division and the U.S. Attorney s Office for Washington, DC, is conducting civil and criminal investigations into the sales and marketing practices of Advanced BioHealing Inc. ( ABH ) relating to DERMAGRAFT, which Shire acquired in June 2011. Following the disposal of the DERMAGRAFT business in January 2014, Shire retained certain legacy liabilities including any liability that may arise from this investigation. 
  Over the last several years, Shire has been cooperating fully with these investigations.  As part of its efforts to cooperate, Shire has engaged in discussions with the Department of Justice about a possible resolution. Following those discussions, Shire reached an agreement on a proposal for a civil settlement in the amount of   $350.0 million   plus interest, subject to negotiating a final settlement agreement and obtaining final approvals. An accrual has been recorded related to the settlement.  Assuming the agreement is finalized, it will resolve the civil investigations conducted by the Department of Justice, including multiple U.S. Attorney s Offices and relevant federal and state agencies.  
  The tentative settlement proposal would settle the federal government s claims under the federal False Claims Act and the DERMAGRAFT Medicaid-related claims for states that opt into the settlement. Some states with DERMAGRAFT Medicaid-related claims might elect to opt out of any final settlement, and those states  claims would remain unresolved. 
  Material issues remain open and subject to further negotiation and approval by Shire, the Department of Justice and other relevant federal and state agencies before the tentative settlement can be finalized. 
  Civil Investigative Demand relating to VANCOCIN 
  On April 6, 2012, ViroPharma Incorporated ( ViroPharma ) received a notification that the United States Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is conducting an investigation into whether ViroPharma had engaged in unfair methods of competition with respect to VANCOCIN. On August 3, 2012, and September 8, 2014, ViroPharma and Shire respectively received Civil Investigative Demands from the FTC requesting additional information related to this matter. Shire has fully cooperated with the FTC s investigation. At this time, Shire is unable to predict the outcome or duration of this investigation. 
  Lawsuit related to supply of ELAPRASE to certain patients in Brazil 
  On September 24, 2014 Shire s Brazilian affiliate, Shire Farmaceutica Brasil Ltda, was served with a lawsuit brought by the State of Sao Paulo and in which the Brazilian Public Attorney s office has intervened alleging that Shire is obligated to provide certain medical care including ELAPRASE for an indefinite period at no cost to patients who participated in ELAPRASE clinical trials in Brazil, and seeking recoupment to the Brazilian government for amounts paid on behalf of these patients to date, and moral damages associated with these claims. 
  On May 6, 2016, the trial court judge ruled on the case and dismissed all the claims under the class action, which decision has been appealed. A final decision is expected within the next 18 months.

    Share-based compensation plans 
     Total share-based compensation recorded by the Company during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015 by line item is as follows: 

The table above includes pre-tax expense during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $45.4 million   and $  191.7 million  , respectively, related to replacement and other awards held by Baxalta employees as further described below. This includes integration related expense during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $22.1 million   and $  160.5 million  , respectively, from the acceleration of unrecognized expense associated with certain employee terminations. 
  Share-based compensation plans that existed as of December 31, 2015 
  Prior to February 28, 2015 the Company granted stock-settled share appreciation rights ( SARs ) and performance share awards ( PSAs ) over ordinary shares and ADSs to Executive Directors and employees under the Shire Portfolio Share Plan ( PSP ) (Parts A and B). Since February 28, 2015 the Company has granted awards under the Shire Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 ( LTIP ). Under the LTIP the Company grants stock-settled SARs, restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and performance share units ( PSUs ) over ordinary shares and ADSs to Executive Directors and employees. 
  These plans and the underlying share-based award grants pursuant to the plans as of December 31, 2015 are further discussed in the Shire 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Replacement Awards Issued to Baxalta Employees 
  In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta and pursuant to the merger agreement associated with the acquisition, outstanding Baxalta equity awards held by Baxalta employees or employees of Baxter were cancelled and exchanged for Shire equity awards. The replacement Shire awards generally have the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as the former Baxalta awards for which they were exchanged. The value of the replacement share-based awards granted was designed to generally preserve the intrinsic value and the fair value of the award immediately prior to the acquisition. 
  Total replacement awards issued to Baxalta and Baxter employees on June 3, 2016 pursuant to the merger agreement were   22.2 million   options and   3.9 million   RSUs.

Total unrecognized expense related to the replacement RSUs issued to acquired Baxalta employees as of September 30, 2016 of   $72.0 million   is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.9 years  .  
   
           23. 
    Agreements and Transactions with Baxter  
     In connection with Baxalta s separation from Baxter on July 1, 2015, Baxalta and Baxter entered into several separation-related agreements that provided a framework for Baxalta s relationship with Baxter after the separation. As a result of the acquisition of Baxalta, the Company became party to the separation-related agreements with Baxter. These agreements, among others, included a manufacturing and supply agreement, a transition services agreement, an international commercial operations agreement and tax matters agreement. 
  Under the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement, the Company manufactures certain products and materials and sells them to Baxter at an agreed-upon price reflecting the Company s cost plus a mark-up for certain products and materials. The Company reported revenues associated with the manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

of approximately   $47 million   from the June 3, 2016 acquisition date through September 30, 2016 and approximately   $31 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Under the terms of the transition services agreement, the Company and Baxter provide various services to each other on an interim, transitional basis. The services provided by Baxter to the Company include certain finance, information technology, human resources, quality, supply chain and other administrative services and functions, and are generally provided on a cost-plus basis. The services generally extend for approximately 2 years following the July 1, 2015 separation except for certain information technology services that may extend for 3 years following the July 1, 2015 separation. The Company reported SG A expenses associated with the transition services agreement with Baxter of approximately   $32 million   from the June 3, 2016 acquisition date through September 30, 2016 and approximately   $24 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  For a certain portion of Baxalta s non U.S. operations, the legal transfer of net assets from Baxter had not occurred by the June 3, 2016 acquisition date due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in each of these countries. Under the terms of the international commercial operations agreement with Baxter, the Company is responsible for the business activities conducted by Baxter on its behalf, and is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. As a result, the related assets and liabilities and results of operations are reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements following the acquisition of Baxalta. The Company reported net sales related to these operations of   $60 million   from the June 3, 2016 acquisition date through September 30, 2016 and approximately   $38 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the assets and liabilities of these operations consisted of inventories of   $43 million  , which are reported in inventories on the consolidated balance sheet, other assets of   $47 million  , which are reported as prepaid expenses and other current assets, and liabilities of   $3 million  , which are reported in other current liabilities. The majority of these operations are expected to be transferred to the Company by the end of 2016.  
  The tax matters agreement governs Baxter and Baxalta s and now the Company s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for any tax period ending on or before the distribution date, as well as tax periods beginning before and ending after the distribution date. In addition, the tax matters agreement addresses the allocation of liability for taxes that were incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the distribution and provides for Baxalta to indemnify Baxter against any tax liabilities resulting from Baxalta s action or inaction that causes the merger-related transactions to be taxable. Net tax-related indemnification liabilities reported by the Company as of   September 30, 2016   are further discussed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, of these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had total amounts due from or to Baxter of   $191 million   reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets,   $34 million   reported in other noncurrent assets,   $124 million   reported in other current liabilities and   $86 million   reported in other noncurrent liabilities. These balances include the net tax-related indemnification liabilities and assets and liabilities of certain operations that have not transferred to the Company.

  Legal Proceedings 
  Investigation related to DERMAGRAFT 
  The Department of Justice, including the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division and the U.S. Attorney s Office for Washington, DC, is conducting civil and criminal investigations into the sales and marketing practices of Advanced BioHealing Inc. ( ABH ) relating to DERMAGRAFT, which Shire acquired in June 2011. Following the disposal of the DERMAGRAFT business in January 2014, Shire retained certain legacy liabilities including any liability that may arise from this investigation.  
  Over the last several years, Shire has been cooperating fully with these investigations.  As part of its efforts to cooperate, Shire has engaged in discussions with the Department of Justice about a possible resolution.  Following those discussions, Shire reached an agreement on a proposal for a civil settlement in the amount of $350 million plus interest, subject to negotiating a final settlement agreement and obtaining final approvals. The Company has recorded an accrual related to the settlement. Assuming the agreement is finalized, it will resolve the civil investigations conducted by the Department of Justice, including multiple U.S. Attorney s Offices and relevant federal and state agencies.  
  The tentative settlement proposal would settle the federal government s claims under the federal False Claims Act and the DERMAGRAFT Medicaid-related claims for states that opt into the settlement. Some states with DERMAGRAFT Medicaid-related claims might elect to opt out of any final settlement, and those states  claims would remain unresolved.

  On October 5, 2016, Shire announced that the U.S. Patent   Trademark Office s Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a decision upholding the validity of U.S. Patent No. 6,773,720, related to LIALDA. 
  District Court issues ruling in Hatch Waxman Case regarding LIALDA 
  On September 16, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that Cadilla Healthcare Ltd./Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. s ( Zydus ) proposed generic version of LIALDA  does not infringe U.S Patent No. 6,773,720 ( the  720 patent ). Shire has appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit. Shire believes that the proposed Zydus product infringes the  720 patent and will continue to vigorously defend its intellectual property rights. 
   
  Results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
  Financial highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows: 
   Excluding Baxalta, product sales increased 12% (13% on a Non GAAP CER basis) with all legacy Shire franchises exhibiting growth: Neuroscience up   15%  , Genetic Diseases up   5%   and Internal Medicine up   15%   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Following the launch of XIIDRA in August 2016, the Opthalmology franchise contributed sales of $14 million. 
             
    Royalties and other revenues were up   75%   to   $136.7 million  , as the third quarter of 2016 benefited from additional revenue acquired with Baxalta primarily related to contract manufacturing activities. 
                
    Operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   $405.9 million   compared to operating income of   $455.5 million   in the same period in 2015.  The operating loss in the three months ended September 2016 was primarily due the impact of acquisition accounting, including higher amortization of inventory fair value step up, amortization of acquired intangible assets, combined with increased integration and acquisition costs. 
                
    Losses per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were   $0.43   compared to diluted earnings per share of   $0.76   for the same period in 2015. The loss in the three months ended September 2016 was primarily due to lower operating income resulting from the impact of acquisition accounting, including higher amortization of inventory fair value step up, amortization of acquired intangible assets, combined with increased integration and acquisition charges, all primarily related to the Baxalta transaction. 
     (1) The Company s management analyzes product sales and revenue growth for certain products sold in markets outside of the U.S. on a constant exchange rate ( CER ) basis, so that product sales and revenue growth can be considered excluding movements in foreign exchange rates. Product sales and revenue growth on a CER basis is a Non GAAP financial measure ( Non GAAP CER ), computed by comparing 2016 product sales and revenues restated using 2015 average foreign exchange rates to 2015 actual product sales and revenues. Average exchange rates used by Shire for the third quarter of 2016 were   $1.32  : 1.00 and   $1.11  : 1.00 (2015:   $1.56  : 1.00 and   $1.11  : 1.00).

  Product revenues  
  The following table provides an analysis of the Company s key product revenues:

     Table of Contents  

Hematology 
  The Hematology franchise was acquired with Baxalta in June 2016 and includes sales of recombinant and plasma-derived hemophilia products (primarily factor VIII and factor IX) and inhibitor therapies. Hematology product sales, totaling $884.1 million and $1,233.7 million, respectively, are included in total product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing 27% and 17% of Shire s reported product sales, respectively. The amount shown for the nine month period represents sales since the Baxalta acquisition only.  
  Genetic Diseases 
  Genetic Diseases product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased   5%   and   11%  , respectively (up   6%   and   12%  , respectively, on a Non GAAP CER basis), compared to the same periods in 2015, led by strong patient growth in FIRAZYR and across the Lysomal Storage Disease portfolio. 
  FIRAZYR sales increased   19%   and   29%  , respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases were driven by strong growth in the number of patients on therapy as well as the impact of pricing actions taken since the second quarter of 2015, which was slightly offset by lower utilization per patient. 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, CINRYZE sales decreased   12%   compared to 2015.  An increase to the number of patients on the therapy was more than offset by destocking and reduced utilization as a result of U.S. supply constraints. Shire has taken steps to increase CINRYZE production and expects to return to normalized supply by early 2017. 
  Neuroscience 
  Neuroscience product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased   15%   and   18%  , respectively (up   16%   and   19%  , respectively, on a Non GAAP CER basis), compared to the same periods in 2015 with growth primarily driven by VYVANSE. 
  VYVANSE sales increased   20%   and   21%   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases were due to year-over-year prescription growth in the U.S., the benefit of price increases taken since the third quarter of 2015 and, to a lesser extent, growth in our international markets. 
  Immunology 
  The Immunology franchise was acquired with Baxalta in June 2016 and includes sales of the Company s antibody-replacement immunoglobulin therapies and bio therapeutic therapies. Immunology product sales, totaling   $606.5 million   and   $796.0 million  , respectively, are included in total product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing 18% and 11% of Shire s reported product sales, respectively. The amount shown for the nine month period represents sales since the Baxalta acquisition only.  
  Internal Medicine 
  Internal Medicine product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased   15%   and   17%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, with strong growth from LIALDA/MEZAVANT, GATTEX/REVESTIVE and NATPARA. 
  LIALDA/MEZAVANT sales increased   18%   for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases were due to the impact of a price increase taken since the third quarter of 2015, increases in prescription demand, resulting in a market share of 40% at the end of the third quarter of 2016. 
  GATTEX/REVESTIVE and NATPARA, which were acquired with NPS in the first quarter of 2015, continued to perform well with sales up   35%   and   238%  , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and   62%   and   359%  , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases are driven by an increase in the number of patients on therapy.

Oncology 
  The Oncology franchise was acquired with Baxalta in June 2016 and represents approximately 1% of Shire s reported product sales for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Ophthalmology 
  Product sales relate to XIIDRA which was made available to patients on August 29, 2016. XIIDRA contributed   $14.1 million   of product sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Royalties and other revenues 
  The following table provides an analysis of Shire s income from royalties and other revenues: 

Royalties and Other Revenues increased   75%   and   45%   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to $39 million and $59 million, respectively, of contract manufacturing revenue acquired with Baxalta. Additionally, SENSIPAR royalties increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the 2016 amount represents a full nine months of royalties. Shire acquired royalty rights to SENSIPAR as part of its acquisition of NPS, which closed February 21, 2015, and revenue prior to that date was recognized by NPS. 
  Cost of sales 
  Cost of sales increased to   $1,736.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (  52%   of product sales), from   $262.7 million   in the corresponding period in 2015 (  17%   of product sales). Cost of sales increased to   $2,762.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (  38%   of product sales), from   $718.5 million   in the corresponding period in 2015 (  16%   of product sales). Cost of sales in each period increased primarily due to the impact of higher amortization of inventory fair value step-ups in 2016 following the acquisitions of Baxalta and Dyax, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower margin product franchises acquired with Baxalta. The Company expects the inventory fair value step-up to be amortized within twelve months of the acquisition date.  
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales included depreciation of   $54.5 million   and   $85.2 million  , respectively (2015: $9.6 million and $34.4 million, respectively).

R D 
  R D expenditure increased to   $511.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (  15%   of product sales), compared to   $241.2 million   in the corresponding period in 2015 (  15%   of product sales). The increase is due to the inclusion of Baxalta and Dyax costs and costs related to licensing SHP647. R D expenditure decreased to   $1,023.0 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (  14%   of product sales), compared to   $1,210.8 million   in the corresponding period in 2015 (  27%   of product sales). This decrease is due to IPR D impairment charges being recorded of $523.3 million recorded during the nine months ended 2015 related to the SHP625 and SHP608 intangible assets. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, R D included depreciation of   $9.0 million   and   $20.7 million  , respectively (2015: $5.5 million and $17.2 million, respectively). 
  SG A 
  SG A expenditure increased to   $875.6 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (  26%   of product sales), from   $442.3 million   in the corresponding period in 2015 (  28%   of product sales). SG A expenditure increased to   $2,025.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (  28%   of product sales) from   $1,356.6 million   in the corresponding period in 2015 (  30%   of product sales). These increases are primarily due to the inclusion of Baxalta related costs in the 2016 periods. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, SG A included depreciation of   $29.6 million   and   $69.4 million  , respectively (2015: $23.6 million and $53.5 million, respectively). 
  Reported SG A for periods prior to the second quarter 2016 have been recast to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, which is now presented as a separate account line in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Amortization of acquired intangible assets 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Shire recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of   $354.9 million   and   $702.5 million  , respectively, compared to   $132.7 million   and   $352.3 million  , respectively, in the corresponding periods in 2015. The increases relate to amortization on the intangible assets acquired with the Baxalta and Dyax transactions. 
  Integration and acquisition costs 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Shire recorded integration and acquisition costs of   $284.5 million   and   $738.6 million  , respectively, primarily related to the Baxalta and Dyax transactions. 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, Shire recorded integration and acquisition costs of $89.9 million, including $30.7 million for costs primarily related to the acquisition and integration of NPS and charges related to the acquisition of Baxalta and $59.2 million relating to the change in fair values of contingent consideration liabilities primarily relating to SHP625 (acquired with Lumena). 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 Shire recorded a net credit for integration and acquisition costs of $46.8 million which is principally comprised of costs of $149.7 million related to the acquisition and integration of NPS Pharma, Viropharma and the preliminary work on the combination with Baxalta, offset by a net credit relating to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $196.5 million. The net credit relating to the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities relates to the acquisition of Lumena and Lotus Tissue Repair Inc. The Lumena contingent consideration decreased as the  probability of success for the SHP625 asset (for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases) decreased following the receipt of data from certain Phase 2 studies and  the agreement in the third quarter of 2015 to settle all future contingent milestones payable to former Lumena shareholders. The contingent consideration from the Lotus Tissue Repair acquisition decreased as the probability of success for the SHP608 asset (for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( DEB )) decreased upon receiving certain preclinical toxicity findings. 
  Reorganization costs 
  
   70 

     Table of Contents  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Shire recorded reorganization costs of   $101.4 million   and   $115.7 million  , respectively (2015: $31.1 million and $59.6 million, respectively), primarily related to the planned closure of a facility at the Los Angeles manufacturing site. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 Shire recorded reorganization costs of   $31.1 million   and   $59.6 million  , respectively, related to the One Shire reorganization and the relocation of roles from Chesterbrook to Lexington. 
  Interest expense 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Shire incurred interest expense of   $186.9 million   and   $318.8 million  , primarily due to increased interest expense and amortization of financing fees incurred on borrowings used to fund the Baxalta and Dyax transactions. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Shire incurred interest expense of $10.7 million and $31.6 million, respectively, primarily related to interest and amortization of financing fees incurred on borrowings to fund the NPS acquisition. 
  Taxation 
  The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   38%   (2015:   -5%  ) and   246%   (2015:   -1%  ), respectively. 
  The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is affected by the combined impact of the relative quantum of the profit before tax for the period by jurisdiction and of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities from the Baxalta acquisition (including in higher tax territories     such as the U.S.) of inventory and intangible assets amortization as well as significant acquisition and integration costs. 
  The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was negative primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances, the effect of the finalization of various tax returns and the re-measurement of uncertain tax positions relating to ongoing tax audits all recognized during the third quarter of 2015. 
  The Company has historically calculated the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to ordinary income or loss for the reporting period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the impact of certain items arising from the Baxalta acquisition has caused significant variations in the estimated effective tax rate. As a result, the Company has applied a permitted exception to the general rule by including the actual income tax effect of certain portions of its business discretely when calculating the provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Discontinued operations 
  The loss from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $18.3 million   and   $257.5 million  , respectively, net of tax, primarily due legal contingencies, including a proposed legal settlement to resolve the previously disclosed Department of Justice investigation associated with the divested DERMAGRAFT business. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, discontinued operations losses totaled $24.3 million and $31.3 million, respectively, net of tax, primarily relating to a change in estimate in relation to onerous lease provisions.

  Cash   cash equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents increased by   $593.1 million   to   $728.6 million   as of September 30, 2016 (December 31, 2015: $135.5 million), primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of   $1,506.0 million  , as well as $583.2 million of cash acquired in the acquisition of Baxalta. These increases are partially offset by the cash used in the acquisition of Baxalta, net of borrowings.

Liquidity and capital resources 
  General 
  The Company s funding requirements depend on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of its development programs; corporate, business and product acquisitions; the level of resources required for the expansion of certain manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the product base expands; increases in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise with any increase in product sales; technological developments; the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory approvals for new products; the timing and quantum of milestone payments on business combinations, in-licenses and collaborative projects; the timing and quantum of tax and dividend payments; the timing and quantum of purchases by the Employee Benefit Trust of Shire shares in the market to satisfy awards granted under Shire s employee share plans; and the amount of cash generated from sales of Shire s products and royalty receipts. 
  An important part of Shire s business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available. The Company intends to defend its intellectual property and as a result may need cash for funding the cost of litigation. 
  The Company finances its activities through cash generated from operating activities; credit facilities; private and public offerings of equity and debt securities; and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals. 
  Shire s balance sheet includes   $728.6 million   of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016. 
  On September 23, 2016, SAIIDAC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued senior notes guaranteed by Shire plc, pursuant to a public offering with a total aggregate principal amount of $12.1 billion.  In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Baxalta, Shire plc has guaranteed senior notes issued by Baxalta totaling $5.0 billion and has assumed $336 million of capital lease obligations. The details of these senior notes are presented in Note 14, Borrowings, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Shire has a revolving credit facility ("RCF) of $2,100 million which matures in 2020, $920 million of which was utilized as of September 30, 2016. The RCF incorporates a $250 million U.S. dollar and Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof. 
  Further in connection with the acquisitions of Baxalta and Dyax, Shire entered into a $5,600 million term loan facility in November 2015 and an $18.0 billion bridge loan in January 2016. The November 2015 term loan facility was fully utilized as of September 30, 2016. The bridge loan was fully repaid and canceled subsequent to the issuance of senior notes on September 23, 2016. The details of these facility agreements are presented in Note 14, Borrowings, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In addition, Shire also has access to certain short-term uncommitted lines of credit which are available to utilize from time to time to provide short-term cash management flexibility.  As of September 30, 2016, these lines of credit were not utilized. 
  The Company may also engage in financing activities from time to time, including accessing the debt or equity capital markets. 
  Financing 
  Shire anticipates that its operating cash flow together with available cash, cash equivalents, and the RCF will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures, tax and interest payments, lease obligations, repayment of the term loans and milestone payments as they become due over the next twelve months. The RCF facility agreement has an extension option. 
  If the Company decides to acquire other businesses, it expects to fund these acquisitions from cash resources, the RCF and through new borrowings (including issuances of debt securities) or the issuance of new equity, if necessary.

Sources and uses of cash 
  The following table provides an analysis of the Company s gross and net debt position (excluding restricted cash), as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1) 
    Net debt is a Non-GAAP measure. Net debt represents US GAAP cash and cash equivalents less US GAAP short and long term borrowings and other debt (see above). The Company believes that Net debt is a useful measure as it indicates the level of borrowings after taking account the cash and cash equivalents that could be utilized to pay down the outstanding borrowings. 
     Substantially all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries (i.e., those subsidiaries incorporated outside of Jersey, Channel Islands, the jurisdiction of incorporation of Shire plc, Shire s holding company). The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company s liquidity and capital resources. 
  Cash flow activity 
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by   $69.2 million  , or   4%  , to   $1,506.0 million   (2015: $1,575.2 million), primarily due to higher tax payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period of 2015, and higher interest payments due to the assumed Baxalta senior notes and utilization of debt facilities to partially fund the acquisition of Dyax. These cash decreases are partially offset by strong cash receipts from higher revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $17,811.3 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, principally relating to the cash paid for the acquisitions of Baxalta ($12,367 million, less cash acquired of $583 million) and Dyax ($5,934 million, less cash acquired of $241 million). 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $5,566.0 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, principally relating to the cash paid for the acquisitions of NPS ($5,220 million, less cash acquired of $42 million), Foresight ($299 million) and Meritage ($75 million). 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $16,900.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, principally due to the issuance of the SAIIDAC Notes in addition to the drawings, net of subsequent repayments, made under the RCF, the January 2016 Facilities Agreement and the November 2015 Facilities Agreement to partially fund the acquisitions of Baxalta and Dyax. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,054.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, principally due to the drawings, net of subsequent repayments, made under the RCF and the January 2015 Facilities Agreement to partially fund the NPS acquisition, to fully repay the 2013 Facilities Agreement and to fund the dividend payment. 
  Obligations and commitments 
  Other than the borrowings incurred to finance the acquisitions of Baxalta and Dyax, as outlined above, and contractual obligations assumed through the acquisition of Baxalta, as outlined in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2016, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there have been no material changes to the Company s contractual obligations previously disclosed in PART II: ITEM 7 of the Shire 2015 Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP and SEC regulations, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of intangible assets (including goodwill), sales deductions, income taxes (including provisions for uncertain tax positions and the realization of deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and legal proceedings, contingent consideration receivable from divestments of products or businesses and contingent consideration payable in respect of business combinations and asset purchases and discussed in the Shire 2015 Form 10-K. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company assumed certain pension and other post-employment benefit ( OPEB ) plans as a result of its acquisition of Baxalta. The following discusses the critical accounting estimates related to the acquired pension and OPEB plans. 
  Measurement of funded status and net periodic benefit cost 
  As of June 3, 2016, the Company measured the funded status and 2016 net periodic benefit cost of its pension and OPEB plans assumed as part of the acquisition of Baxalta. The valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost was calculated using actuarial assumptions. These significant assumptions include the following: 
             
    interest rates used to discount pension and OPEB plan liabilities; 
                
    the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets; 
                
    rates of increases in employee compensation (used in estimating liabilities); 
                
    anticipated future healthcare costs (used in estimating the OPEB plan liability); and 
                
    other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover (used in estimating liabilities). 
     Selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term and long-term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation (also called the measurement date). The use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost. Actual results in the future could differ from expected results. The Company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results, but believes its assumptions are appropriate. The Company s key assumptions are listed in Note 15, Retirement and Other Benefit Programs to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in PART I: ITEM 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
  If actual results differ from the Company s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods, the Company s results of operations could either benefit from, or be adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Market risk 
  The Company is subject to certain risks which may affect its results of operations, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate movements, pricing pressures worldwide and weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which it operates. The Company manages the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate lock contracts and interest rate swap contracts. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The counter-parties to the contracts Company enter into are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. 
  Interest rate risk 
  The Company is exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in benchmark interest rates relating to its debt obligations on which interest is set at floating rates. The Company s policy is to manage this risk to an acceptable level. The Company is principally exposed to interest rate risk on any borrowings under the Company s various debt facilities and on part of the senior notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of Baxalta. Interest on each of these debt obligations is set at fixed and/or floating rates, to the extent utilized. Shire s exposure under these facilities is to changes in U.S. dollar interest rates. For details see Note 13, Financial Instruments, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on its restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange contracts on which interest is set at floating rates. As the Company maintains all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was less than 1% per annum. These cash and liquid investments were primarily invested in U.S. dollar term deposits with banks and money market and liquidity funds or held as cash on account. 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company estimates that a hypothetical increase and decrease in the interest rate by 100-basis points would increase and decrease the net interest costs by approximately $70.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively. If realized, the increase or decrease in the interest costs would affect earnings over the life of the contracts. The Company estimates that such hypothetical 100-basis points adverse increase in the interest rates would decrease the fair value of the long term debt by $1.0 billion at September 30, 2016. 
  Credit risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short-term cash investments, derivative contracts and trade accounts receivable (from product sales and from third parties from which the Company receives royalties). Cash is invested in short-term money market instruments, including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits or held on account. The money market and liquidity funds in which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both Standard and Poor s and by Moody s credit rating agencies. 
  The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into bank term deposit arrangements and derivative instruments. The Company limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which vary according to ratings assigned to the counterparties by the major rating agencies. The internal credit limits are approved by Shire s Board of Directors and exposure against these limits is monitored by the Company s corporate treasury function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international financial institutions. 
  The Company s revenues from product sales in the U.S. are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were three customers in the U.S. that accounted for 38% of the Company s product sales. However, such customers typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable. The Company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures. However, an inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

A substantial portion of the Company s accounts receivable in countries outside of the United States is derived from product sales to government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company s recovery of these accounts receivable is therefore dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of the relevant governments. In recent years global and national economic conditions have negatively affected the growth, creditworthiness and general economic condition of certain markets in which the Company operates. As a result, in some countries outside of the U.S., specifically, Argentina, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain (collectively the  Relevant Countries ) the Company is experiencing delays in the remittance of receivables due from government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company continues to receive remittances in relation to government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers in the Relevant Countries in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, including receipts of $99.9 million and $90.7 million in respect of Spanish and Italian receivables, respectively. The Company s exposure to Greece, both in terms of gross accounts receivable and annual revenues, is not material. 
  To date, the Company has not incurred material losses on accounts receivable in the Relevant Countries, and continues to consider that such accounts receivable are recoverable. The Company will continue to evaluate all its accounts receivable for potential collection risks and has made provision for amounts where collection is considered to be doubtful. If the financial condition of the Relevant Countries or other Eurozone countries suffer significant deterioration, such that their ability to make payments becomes uncertain, or if one or more Eurozone member countries withdraws from the Euro, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required, and losses may be incurred, in future periods. Any such loss could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
  Foreign exchange risk 
  The Company operates in numerous countries and as a consequence has foreign exchange exposure. The main operating currencies of the Company are the U.S. dollar, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Franc, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and the Euro. It is the Company s policy that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the subsidiary s functional currency. 
  Where significant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts (spot, forward and swap contracts) to manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. These assets and liabilities relate predominantly to inter-company financing. The Company has not elected hedge accounting for these transactions. Cash flows from derivative instruments are presented within net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging specific investing or financing activities. 
  Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation into U.S. dollars of the financial statements of non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries. For details see Note 13, Financial Instruments, to these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
  As of September 30, 2016 the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, including those with respect to the Income Access Share ( IAS ) Trust but excluding Baxalta s internal control over financial reporting. The Company s management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, including those with respect to the IAS Trust but excluding Baxalta s internal control over financial reporting, are effective at the reasonable level of assurance to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
  Except for the change noted below, there have been no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended

September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  In June 2016, Shire acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests in Baxalta Inc. As part of the post-closing integration, the Company is engaged in refining and harmonizing the internal controls and processes of the acquired business with those of the Company. Management intends to exclude the internal controls of Baxalta from its annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting for 2016. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from management s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of consolidation.
