Statements (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1:  
      Nature of Operation and Conversion   

Cincinnati Bancorp ( Cincinnati
Bancorp  and, together with Cincinnati Federal, the  Company ) is the parent holding company of Cincinnati Federal
(the  Bank ) and the majority-owned subsidiary of CF Mutual Holding Company ( CF Mutual ), a Federally-chartered
mutual holding company. 

The Bank is a federally chartered
thrift institution and is primarily engaged in providing a full range of banking and financial services to individual and corporate
customers in Hamilton County, Ohio and surrounding areas. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions.
The Bank is subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory
authorities. During the second quarter of 2016, Cincinnati Federal ceased the operations of the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary,
Cincinnati Federal Investment Services, LLC. The termination of Cincinnati Federal Investment Services, LLC did not have a material
impact on operations. 

On October 14, 2015, the Bank
completed a mutual-to-stock conversion pursuant to which it became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bancorp and CF Mutual
was established as the mutual holding company of Cincinnati Bancorp. As part of the conversion transaction, Cincinnati Bancorp
sold, in a subscription offering and at a price of $10.00 per share, 45% of its common stock to the Bank s eligible members,
to the Bank s employee stock ownership plan ( ESOP ) and to certain other persons. The total offering value and
the number of shares was based on an independent appraiser s valuation. The remaining 55% of the common stock was issued
to CF Mutual. Cincinnati Bancorp s common stock is currently quoted on the OTCPink Market, operated by OTC Markets Group,
Inc., under the symbol  CNNB.  

The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 8
of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto of the Company as of December 31, 2015 included in Cincinnati Bancorp s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been included to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016
and the results of operation for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All interim amounts have not
been audited and results of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, included herein are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the entire fiscal year. 

The Company evaluates subsequent
events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Cincinnati Bancorp  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

Principles of Consolidation  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include
the accounts of Cincinnati Bancorp and the Bank. All significant intercompany items have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses,
valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, loan servicing rights and fair values
of financial instruments.

NOTE 2:  
      Securities   

Available for sale securities
are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income.
Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Gains
and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. 

For debt securities with fair
value below amortized cost when the Company does not intend to sell a debt security, and it is more likely than not the Company
will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it recognizes the credit component of an other-than-temporary
impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. 

The amortized cost and approximate
fair values, together with gross unrealized gains and losses, of securities are as follows: 

The Company had no sales of investment securities
during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company had not pledged any of its investment securities
as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Cincinnati Bancorp  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

The amortized cost and fair value
of available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected
maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without
call or prepayment penalties. 

Certain
investments in debt securities have fair values at an amount less than their historical cost. The total fair value of these investments
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $1,723,706, respectively, which is approximately 0% and 69%, respectively
of the Company s investment portfolio.   

The
following tables show the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments with unrealized losses that
are not deemed to be other-than-temporary impaired, aggregated by investment class and length of time that individual securities
have been in continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The Company has adopted a standard grading
system for all loans. 

Definitions are as follows: 

Prime (1)  loans are of
superior quality with excellent credit strength and repayment ability proving a nominal credit risk. 

Good (2)  loans are of
above average credit strength and repayment ability proving only a minimal credit risk. 

Satisfactory (3)  loans
are of reasonable credit strength and repayment ability proving an average credit risk due to one or more underlying weaknesses. 

Acceptable (4)  loans are
of the lowest acceptable credit strength and weakened repayment ability providing a cautionary credit risk due to one or more underlying
weaknesses. New borrowers are typically not underwritten within this classification. 

Special Mention (5)  loans
have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may
result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date.
Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
Ordinarily, special mention credits have characteristics which corrective management action would remedy. 

Substandard (6)  loans
are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized
by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful (7)  loans have
all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or
liquidation in full, on the basis of current known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loss (8)  loans are considered
uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not
mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off
even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.

The following tables present the credit risk profile of the
Company s loan portfolio based on internal rating category and payment activity as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,

above consists of loans graded Prime (1) through Acceptable (4). 

The Company evaluates the loan
risk grading system definitions and allowance for loan losses methodology on an ongoing basis. No significant changes were made
to either during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.

There were no TDRs modified during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 that subsequently defaulted. 

As of September 30, 2016, borrowers
with loans designated as TDRs totaling $1,004,000 of residential real estate loans and $654,000 of multifamily loans, met the criteria
for placement back on accrual status. This criteria is a minimum of six consecutive months of payment performance under existing
or modified terms. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had no loans that did not meet the criteria for placement back on accrual
status. 

There was one foreclosed real
estate property or consumer mortgage loan in process of foreclosure at September 30, 2016 totaling $37,950. There were no foreclosed
real estate properties or consumer mortgage loans in process of foreclosure at December 31, 2015.

NOTE 4:   
       Earnings Per Share    

Basic earnings per common share
is computed based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, less shares in the Company s
Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) that are unallocated and not committed to be released. There were no dilutive
shares at September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. 

The computations are as follows: 

NOTE 5:   
       Regulatory Matters    

The Company is subject to various
regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s
capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings
and other factors. Furthermore, the Company s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in
these financial statements. 

Quantitative measures established
by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below)
of total and Tier I capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier I capital (as defined) to risk-weighted
assets (as defined) and of Tier I capital to average assets (as defined). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject at such dates. 

Effective January 1, 2015, new
regulatory capital requirements commonly referred to as  Basel III  were implemented and are reflected below. Management
opted out of the accumulated comprehensive income treatment under the new requirements, and as such unrealized gains and losses
from available-for-sale securities will continue to be excluded from regulatory capital.

A new rule requiring a Capital
Conservation Buffer began phase-in on January 1, 2016. Under the fully-implemented rule, a financial institution will need to maintain
a Capital Conservation Buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of at least 2.5% above its minimum risk-weighted capital
requirements to avoid limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments to shareholders and
certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. A financial institution with a buffer below 2.5% will be subject to
increasingly stringent limitations on capital distributions as the buffer approaches zero. 

As of the most recent notification
from their regulators, the Company and Bank were categorized as  well-capitalized  under the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action.  Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since the last notification
that would change the Bank's category. 

The Bank s actual capital
amounts and ratios are also presented in the following table:

NOTE 6:   
       Disclosure About Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities    

Fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1       
      Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2   
      Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full-term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level 3   
      Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   

Recurring Measurements 

The following tables present
the fair value measurements of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy
in which the fair value measurements fall at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Following is a description of
the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on recurring basis and recognized in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Available-for-sale Securities 

Where quoted market prices are
available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices
are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent
asset pricing services and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including,
but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows.
Such securities are classified in 

Cincinnati Bancorp  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
In certain cases where Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

Mortgage servicing rights do
not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using discounted cash
flow models having significant inputs of loan balance, weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity, escrow payments, servicing
fees, prepayment speeds, float, cost to service, ancillary income, and discount rate. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs,
mortgage servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. 

Mortgage servicing rights are
tested for impairment. Management measures mortgage servicing rights through use of a third-party independent valuation. Inputs
to the model are reviewed by management. 

The following is a reconciliation
of the beginning and ending balances of recurring fair value measurements related to mortgage servicing rights recognized in the
accompanying balance sheets using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs: 

Mortgage servicing rights are
carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in other noninterest income in the period
in which the changes occur. 

Collateral-dependent Impaired Loans, Net
of Allowance for Loan Losses 

The Company considers the appraisal
or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that
may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral-dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined
to be collateral-dependent and subsequently as deemed necessary by management. Appraisals are reviewed for accuracy and consistency
by management. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are
reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent
on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and estimates are developed by management by comparison to historical results.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale 

Foreclosed assets held for sale are carried at the
lower of fair value at acquisition date or current estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell when the real estate is acquired.
Estimated fair value of real estate is based on appraisals or evaluations. Foreclosed assets held for sale are classified within
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Appraisals of real estate are obtained when the real
estate is acquired and an appraisal is subsequently deemed necessary by events in the environment by the Chief Financial Officer.
Appraisals are reviewed internally for accuracy and consistency in accordance with regulatory requirements. Appraisers are selected
from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. 

The following table presents the fair value measurements
of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value
measurements fell at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Unobservable (Level 3) Inputs 

The following tables present quantitative information
about unobservable inputs used in recurring Level 3 fair value measurements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The following methods were used
to estimate the fair value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying balance sheets at amounts other than
fair value. 

Cash and cash equivalents, Federal Home
Loan Bank Stock and Interest Receivable 

The carrying amount approximates fair value. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Fair value of loans held for
sale is based on quoted market prices, where available, or is determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates
approximating the Bank s current origination rates for similar loans and adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. 

Loans 

The fair value of loans is estimated
by discounting the future cash flows using the market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Loans with
similar characteristics were aggregated for purposes of the calculations. 

Cincinnati Bancorp  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

Federal Home Loan Bank Lender Risk Account
Receivable 

The fair value of the Federal
Home Loan Bank lender risk account receivable is estimated by discounting the estimated remaining cash flows of each strata of
the receivable at current rates applicable to each strata for the same remaining maturities. 

Deposits 

Deposits include demand deposits
and savings accounts. The carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of fixed-maturity time deposits is estimated
using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

Rates currently available to
the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt. Fair value
of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active
market. If a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique is used to estimate fair value. 

Advances from Borrowers
for Taxes and Insurance and Interest Payable 

The carrying amount approximates fair value. 

Commitments to Originate Loans, Forward
Sale Commitments, Letters of Credit and Lines of Credit 

The fair value of commitments
to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining
terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also
considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of forward sale commitments
is estimated based on current market prices for loans of similar terms and credit quality. The fair values of letters of credit
and lines of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value
of commitments was not material.

NOTE 7:    Commitments and Credit Risk  

Commitments to Originate
Loans 

Commitments to originate loans
are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments
may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer s
creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management s
credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant
and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate. 

Forward sale commitments are
commitments to sell groups of residential mortgage loans that the Company originates or purchases as part of its mortgage banking
activities. The Company commits to sell the loans at specified prices in a future period. These commitments are acquired to reduce
market risk on mortgage loans in the process of origination and mortgage loans held for sale since the Company is exposed to interest
rate risk during the period between issuing a loan commitment and the sale of the loan into the secondary market. 

The dollar amount of commitments
to fund fixed rate loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 follows: 

Lines of Credit 

Lines of credit are agreements
to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Lines of credit generally
have fixed expiration dates. Since a portion of the line may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused lines do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. Each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held
varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real
estate. Management uses the same credit policies in granting lines of credit as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Codification (FASB ASC) 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact it
may have on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2016-13, Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326)   

In June 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU significantly changes how
entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair
value through net income. 

Cincinnati Bancorp  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

In issuing the standard, the
FASB is responding to criticism that today s guidance delays recognition of credit losses. The standard will replace today s
 incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model. The new model, referred to as the current expected
credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity
securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS )
debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what
they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income
over time, as they do today. The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating
the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class
of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).
The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have
on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2016-09, Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)   

In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU includes provisions intended
to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Some
of the key provisions of this new ASU include: (1) companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies
in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ). Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income
tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. The guidance also eliminates the requirement
that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them. In addition, the guidance requires companies to present
excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity; (2) increase the
amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification
for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. The new guidance will also require
an employer to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding
obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows (current guidance did not specify how these cash flows should
be classified); and (3) permit companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition
of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur. ASU
No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted,
but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09
to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

FASB ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842)   

ASU No. 2016-02 was issued in
February 2016 and requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments ( the
lease liability ) and a right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, initially measured at the present value of
the lease payments. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, the lessee should include payments to be made in
optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain, as defined, to exercise an option to the lease or not to exercise an
option to terminate the lease. Optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included if the lessee is reasonably
certain it will exercise the purchase option. Most variable lease payments should be excluded except for those that depend on an
index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments. 

A lessee shall classify a lease
as a finance lease if it meets any of the five listed criteria: 

a.  The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.   

b.  The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably
certain to exercise.   

c.  The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset.   

d.  The present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee
equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.   

e.  The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative
use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.   

For finance
leases, a lessee shall recognize in the statement of income interest on the lease liability separately from the amortization
of the right-of-use asset. Amortization of the right-to-use asset shall be on a straight-line basis, unless another basis is more
representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the right-of-use asset s future economic benefits. If
the lease does not meet any of the five criteria, the lessee shall classify it as an operating lease and shall recognize a single
lease cost on a straight line basis over the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to
make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee
makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

FASB  ASU 2016-01  Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   .     

In January 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities. For public business entities, the amendments in this update include the elimination of the requirement
to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value that is required to be disclosed for
financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, the requirement to use the exit price notion when
measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, the requirement to present separately in other
comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the
instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the
fair value option for financial instruments, the requirement for separate presentation of financial assets and financial
liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the
balance sheet or accompanying notes to the financial statements, and the amendments clarify that an entity should evaluate
the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the
entity's other deferred tax assets. 

Cincinnati Bancorp  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  

For public business entities,
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is not permitted, except that early application by public business
entities to financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued or, by all other entities, that
have not yet been made available for issuance are permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption for the following
amendment: An entity should present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value
of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the entity has elected to measure the liability
at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. An entity should apply the amendments to this
update by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Management
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2015-11, Transfers
and Servicing   

Transfers and Servicing (Topic
860), Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures , was issued in June 2015. The amendments
in this Update require disclosures for certain transactions comprising a transfer of a financial asset accounted for as a sale
and an agreement with the same transferee entered into in contemplation of the initial transfer that results in the transferor
retaining substantially all of the exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial asset throughout the term of the
transaction. This Update also requires certain disclosures for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity
transactions that are accounted for as secured borrowings. The accounting changes in this Update were effective for public business
entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2015. For public business entities, the disclosure
for certain transactions accounted for as a sale is required to be presented for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2015, and for disclosure for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions
accounted for as secured borrowings is required to be presented for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim
periods beginning after March 15, 2015. The disclosures are not required to be presented for comparative periods before the effective
date. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers   

In May 2015, the FASB issued
amended guidance on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities
to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most contract revenue recognition guidance,
including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within the reporting period, and should be applied either retrospectively
to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized
at the date of initial application. Early adoption is prohibited. Management is currently in the process of evaluating the impact
of the adoption of the amended guidance on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

General  

Management s discussion and analysis
of the financial condition and results of operations at and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained
in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part
I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This quarterly report contains forward-looking
statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as  estimate,   project,   believe, 
 intend,   anticipate,   assume,   plan,   seek,   expect, 
 will,   may,   should,   indicate,   would,   believe, 
 contemplate,   continue,   target  and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to: 

statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;     

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;     

statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and     

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.     

These forward-looking statements are based
on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties
and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions
with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any
obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q. 

The following factors, among others, could
cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

our ability to manage our operations under the current adverse economic conditions nationally
and in our market area;    

adverse changes in the financial industry, securities, credit and national local real estate
markets (including real estate values), or in the secondary mortgage markets;     

significant increases in our loan losses, including as a result of our inability to resolve classified
and non-performing assets or reduce risks associated with our loans, and management s assumptions in determining the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses;    

credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies
and write-offs and in our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses;    

the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which may prove to be
incorrect and result in significant declines in valuations;    

competition among depository and other financial institutions;    

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and to grow our franchise to improve
profitability;    

our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and to obtain FHLB-Cincinnati advances;    

changes in interest rates generally, including changes in the relative differences between short
term and long term interest rates and in deposit interest rates, that may affect our net interest margin and funding sources, and
our ability to originate loans for portfolio and for sale in the secondary market;    

fluctuations in the demand for loans, which may be affected by the number of unsold homes, land
and other properties in our market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our market area;    

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;    

declines in the yield on our assets resulting from the current low interest rate environment;    

risks related to a high concentration of loans secured by real estate located in our market area;    

the results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators
may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, write down assets, change our regulatory capital
position, limit our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could
adversely affect our dividends and earnings;    

changes in the level of government support of housing finance;    

our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;     

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including
the Dodd-Frank Act and the JOBS Act, which could result in, among other things, increased deposit insurance premiums and assessments,
capital requirements, regulatory fees and compliance costs, particularly the new capital regulations, and the resources we have
available to address such changes;     

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;

changes in our compensation and benefit plans, and our ability to retain key members of our senior
management team and to address staffing needs in response to product demand or to implement our strategic plans;    

loan delinquencies and changes in the underlying cash flows of our borrowers;    

our ability to control costs and expenses, particularly those associated with operating as a
publicly traded company;    

the failure or security breaches of computer systems on which we depend;    

the ability of key third-party service providers to perform their obligations to us;    

changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own;
and    

other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and operational factors affecting our operations,
pricing, products and services described elsewhere in this prospectus.    

Because of these and a wide variety of other
uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

There are no material changes to the critical
accounting policies disclosed in Cincinnati Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 

Total Assets.    Total assets
were $156.4 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $14.2 million, or 10.0%, over the $142.2 million at December 31, 2015.
The increase resulted primarily from increases in cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million and net loans of $10.7 million, offset
in part by a decrease of $605,000 in available-for-sale securities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and
cash equivalents increased $4.0 million, or 48.4%, to $12.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $8.3 million at December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily the result of additional FHLB borrowings of $12.0 million and checking deposit growth of $3.7 million,
offset in part by funding an increase in net loans of $10.7 million and a decrease in certificates of deposits of $2.6 million. 

Net Loans .   Net loans increased
$10.7 million, or 8.9%, to $130.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $119.8 million at December 31, 2015. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we originated $32.1 million of loans for portfolio, $15.2 million of which were one- to four- family
residential real estate loans, $6.6 million were multi-family loans, $2.6 million were nonresidential loans, $5.1 million were
home equity lines of credit, $2.3 million were construction and land loans, $200,000 were commercial loans and $3,000 were consumer
loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold $44.5 million of one to four family residential loans, on both
a servicing retained and servicing released basis. Subject to market conditions, management intends to continue this
sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale revenue and servicing fee income. 

The largest increase in our loan portfolio
was in the one- to four-family owner occupied residential real estate loan portfolio which grew $4.1 million or 6.1%. The multifamily
portfolio increased $4.2 million or 25.5% and the nonresidential portfolio increased $1.5 million or 12.4% during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The home equity lines of credit portfolio increased $1.6 million or 15.8% to $12.1 million at September
30, 2016. This loan portfolio increase reflects our strategy to grow the portfolio with adjustable-rate loans and mitigate interest
rate risk on the balance sheet. We currently sell certain fixed-rate, 15- and 30-year term mortgage loans. We have sold loans on
both a servicing-released and servicing-retained basis to: the FHLB-Cincinnati, through its mortgage purchase program; Freddie
Mac; and certain private sector third-party buyers. 

Loans Held for Sale .   Loans
held for sale decreased $216,000 to $2.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.4 million at December 31, 2015. 

Available-for-Sale Securities.  
 Available-for-sale securities, which consisted entirely of government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, decreased $605,000,
or 24.3%, to $1.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.5 million at December 31, 2015. There were no securities purchases during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $608,000 in maturities, the remaining difference was due to the change in market values
within the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Deposits.    Deposits increased
$2.1 million, or 2.0%, to $105.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $103.0 million at December 31, 2015. Core deposits, defined
as demand, NOW and savings accounts, increased $4.7 million, or 13.2%, to $40.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $36.0 million
at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of marketing efforts directed at increasing demand deposit accounts.
The primary marketing effort involved offering a one-time bonus payment of up to $300 to open a new checking account with direct
deposit. Time deposits decreased $2.6 million, or 4.0%, to $64.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $67.0 million at December 31,
2015. The decrease in time deposits was primarily due to lower CD offering rates on certain terms to decrease CD interest expense. 
 Certificates originated through the National CD Rateline service declined $2.1 million to $18.3 million at September 30,
2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, management continued its strategy of pursuing growth in lower cost core
deposits, and intends to continue its efforts to increase core deposits. 

Stockholders  Equity.    Stockholders 
equity increased $499,000, or 2.8%, to $18.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $17.6 million at December 31, 2015. The increase
resulted from net income for the period of $463,000 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $36,000. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 

General.  Net income for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 was $287,000, compared to net income of $121,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $166,000, or 137.7%. The increase was primarily due to a $260,000 increase in noninterest income and a $108,000 increase in
net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $130,000 and a decrease in the provision of loan
losses of $21,000. 

Interest Income.   Interest
income increased $103,000, or 8.4%, to $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable quarter in 2015.
Interest income on loans increased $103,000, or 8.4%, to $1.3 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $1.2 million for the
comparable quarter in 2015. The average balance of loans during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $15.6 million
to $133.6 million, compared to $117.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average yield on loans decreased
17 basis points to 3.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.15% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Interest income on securities available-for-sale remained the same due to a 30 basis point increase in average yield on the securities
portfolio offset by a $847,000 decrease in the balance of the average securities portfolio during the quarter ended September 30,
2016. Interest income on other investments increased $1,000 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter in 2015. 

Interest Expense.   Total interest
expense decreased $4,000, or 1.3%, to $334,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $338,000 for the quarter ended September
30, 2015. Interest expense on deposit accounts decreased 11,000, or 4.1%, to $252,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016
from $263,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The decrease between comparable quarters in 2016 from 2015 was primarily
due to a $16,000 decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit resulting from a $4.5 million, or 6.4%, decrease in the
average balance of these certificates. The average cost of certificates was unchanged at 1.41%. Checking interest expense increased
$5,000 from the comparable quarter in 2015. The increase in interest expense in the checking accounts reflects bonus incentives
offered on new checking accounts. The bonus promotion program ended at the end of June 2016 although certain bonus payments were
incurred in the third quarter of 2016. The average balances in interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.5 million to $17.2 million compared to $14.7 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Savings interest expense remained unchanged at $5,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to September
30, 2015. 

Interest expense on FHLB advances increased
$6,000, or 8.1%, to $82,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $75,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The
average balance of advances increased $8.9 million, or 44.3%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The average cost of FHLB
borrowing decreased 37 basis points to 1.13% from 1.50%. The decrease in the average cost of advances results from the use of lower
cost, short term cash management advances. 

Net Interest Income .  Net interest
income increased $108,000, or 12.0%, to $1.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $900,000 the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. Average interest-earning assets increased $20.3 million primarily due to a $15.6 million increase in
average outstanding loans during the quarter. In addition, DDA balances held at the Federal Home Loan Bank were reclassified as
interest earning as the account was migrated from a compensating balance pricing structure to an explicit pricing structure. The
net impact in the current interest rate environment is not significant. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.0 million
from the same quarter in 2015 due to the funding needed for the increase in lending during the first quarter of 2016. The interest
rate spread decreased 23 basis points to 2.67% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.90% at quarter ended September
30, 2015. The net interest margin decreased 12 basis points to 2.83% for the second quarter of 2016 from 2.95% for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. The interest rate spread and net interest margin were impacted by a continuation of the low interest
rate environment. 

Provision for Loan Losses.  
The provision for loan losses decreased $21,000, or 100.0%, as there was a negative provision for loan losses recorded for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was based on managements  evaluation and
was primarily due to the improving quality of the loan portfolio, as total delinquencies and other nonperforming loans decreased,
and continued favorable economic conditions. 

The allowance for loan losses reflects the
estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016.
While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such
estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount
of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact our financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require
an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different
than those of management. 

Non-Interest Income   .  Non-interest
income increased $260,000, or 45.9%, to $825,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $565,000 for the comparable quarter
in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $226,000 increase in gain on sale of loans in the three months ended September 30,
2016. Other noninterest income increased $30,000, or 31.6%, to $123,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Servicing income
on the sold loan portfolio increased $4,000 due to an increase in the total amount of loans serviced, primarily, for the FHLB  
Cincinnati and Freddie Mac. The fair market adjustment on mortgage servicing rights decreased $35,000, or 51.0%, for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Non-Interest Expense.   Non-interest
expense increased $130,000, or 10.0%, to $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due primarily to a $109,000, or 16.5%, increase in salary and employee benefits
to $770,000 in the second quarter of 2016 from $661,000 for the comparable quarter in 2015 caused by increased staffing demands,
higher commission payouts to mortgage loan officers, ESOP expense and payroll expense. Data processing expense increased $16,000,
or 13.1%, to $138,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $122,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was due to bank growth. Advertising expense decreased $1,000, or 4.0%. Loan cost expense decreased $22,000 or 23.2% primarily due
to a reduction in lender credits given to borrowers due to market conditions. Other non-interest expense increased $16,000, or
14.9%, to $120,000 during the second quarter of 2016 from $104,000 for the comparable quarter in 2015 due primarily to increased
costs related to being a public company including legal, transfer agent, printing and filing fees of $13,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Federal Income Taxes.   Federal
income taxes increased $93,000 due to an increase in pre-tax income of $259,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared
to pre-tax income for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Average Balances and Yields  .
The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at the dates and
for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made. Any adjustments necessary to present yields on a
tax-equivalent basis are insignificant. All average balances are monthly average balances. Management does not believe that the
use of month-end balances instead of daily average balances has caused any material differences in the information presented. Non-accrual
loans were included in the computation of average balances only. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees,
discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. 

(1)  Consists of FHLB-Cincinnati stock, FHLB DDA, certificates
of deposit and cash reserves. 

(2)  Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted
average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.   

(3)  Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning
assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. 

(4)  Net interest margin represents annualized net interest
income divided by average total interest-earning assets.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 

General .  Net income for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $463,000, compared to net income of $428,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $35,000, or 8.0%. The increase was primarily attributable to a $195,000 increase in net interest income and a $112,000
increase in non-interest interest income after provision for loan losses, partially offset by a $306,000 increase in noninterest
expense. 

Interest Income.   Interest
income increased $281,000, or 7.7%, to $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable nine months
in 2015. Interest income on loans increased $286,000 primarily due to a $15.4 million increase in the average balance of loans
during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same nine months in 2015, partially offset by a 21 basis point decrease in
the average yield on loans. Interest income on securities available-for-sale decreased $8,000 primarily due to a 10 basis point
decrease in average yield on the securities portfolio and a $894,000 decrease in the average balance of the securities portfolio
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Interest income on other investments increased $4,000 in the first nine months
of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was the result, in part, of FHLB DDA pricing migrating from a compensating
balance arrangement to explicit pricing with collected DDA balances earning a daily rate of interest. 

Interest Expense.   Total interest
expense increased $86,000, or 9.0%, to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $957,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $102,000, or 14.0%, to $828,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $727,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase between comparable nine month periods
in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to a $74,000 increase in interest expense on checking accounts. The increase in checking account
expense reflects a promotional one-time bonus paid to new checking account customers. The checking account promotion ended in June
2016. Interest expense on certificates of deposit increased $29,000 resulting from a $2.5 million, or 3.9%, increase in the average
balance of these certificates. There was no change in the average cost of certificates of deposit. Interest expense on savings
accounts decreased $2,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an $826,000 decrease in the average
balance of savings accounts. 

Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased
$16,000, or 6.8%, to $215,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $231,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The average balance of advances increased $2.5 million to $23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
$20.8 million for the same nine months in 2015, while the average cost of these advances decreased 25 basis points to 1.23% from
1.48%. The decrease in the average cost of FHLB advances was due to the increased use of lower cost, short term cash management
borrowings. 

Net Interest Income .  Net interest
income increased $195,000, or 7.2%, to $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.7 million the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Average interest-earning assets increased $19.6 million primarily due to a $15.4 million increase
in average outstanding loans during the nine months and the reclassification of FHLB DDA balances as interest earning. Interest-bearing
liabilities increased $4.4 million from the same nine months in 2015 due to the funding needed for the increase in lending during
the first nine months of 2016. The interest rate spread declined 38 basis points to 2.63% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 from 3.01% for the comparable nine months in 2015. Our net interest margin decreased 24 basis points to 2.81% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The interest rate spread and net interest
margin were impacted by a continuation of the low interest rate environment. 

Provision for Loan Losses.  
The provision for loan losses decreased $62,000. A negative provision of $21,000 for loan losses was recorded for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision of $41,000 for the same nine months in 2015. The decrease in the provision for
loan losses was due to the improving quality of the loan portfolio as total delinquencies and other nonperforming loans decreased. 

Non-Interest Income   .  Non-interest
income increased $112,000, or 6.4%, to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.8 million for the comparable
nine months in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $140,000, or 11.1%, in gain on sale of loans. Other non-interest
income decreased $39,000 primarily due to a $91,000 decrease in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable nine months in 2015. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights recorded a
loss of $104,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $13,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in value is principally the result of the increase in projected prepayment speeds due to lower mortgage
rates and a higher discount rate used in the valuation model. Servicing fees on loans sold increased $11,000 or 10.7% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in the amount of loans serviced for the FHLB-Cincinnati and Freddie Mac. Loan
origination fees increased $46,000 or 67.9% due to higher loan origination volumes compared to the comparable nine months in 2015. 

Non-Interest Expense.   Non-interest
expense increased $306,000, or 8.0%, to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due in part to a $158,000, or 8.2%, increase in salary and employee
benefits to $2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Data processing expense increased $48,000, or 13.6%, to $406,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $357,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due
to a one-time assessment for PCI compliance from our core data processor and bank growth. Advertising expense increased $34,000
primarily from a checking account promotional campaign. The promotional campaign ended in June 2016. Franchise tax expense increased
$35,000 due to higher capital levels from the stock offering. The state of Ohio assesses franchise tax based on the level of capital.
Other non-interest expense increased $64,000, or 18.9%, to $400,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $336,000
for the comparable nine months in 2015 due primarily to increased costs related being a public company including legal, transfer
agent, printing and filing fees of $54,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Federal Income Taxes.   Federal
income taxes, which are based on operating results, increased $30,000 due to increased pre-tax net income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
Liquidity is the ability to meet financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed
to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary
source of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds
from the sale or maturities of securities. In addition, the Bank may borrow from the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, we had $30.8
million outstanding in advances from the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, we had FHLB stock based capacity to borrow an additional
$5.9 million and collateral based capacity to borrow $42.2 million. The Bank had additional lines of credit with two commercial
banks totaling $6.5 million. Additionally the Bank has contingent funding sources with CDARS and the StoneCastle s Federally
Insured Cash Account (FICA) program. 

While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and securities are probable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest
rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short term investments including interest-bearing
demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during
any given period. 

Our cash flows are comprised of three primary
classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided (used)
by operating activities was $276,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and ($506,000) for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase
of securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities
and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $13.5 million
for nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit
accounts and FHLB advances, was $13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $18.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 resulting from our strategy of increasing retail checking and FHLB borrowings to fund loan originations. 

We are committed to maintaining a strong
liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet
our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant
portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. We also anticipate continued participation in the National CD Rateline Program
as a wholesale source of certificates of deposit, and continued use of FHLB-Cincinnati advances. 

Cincinnati Bancorp is a separate legal entity
from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay any dividend to its stockholders and for other corporate purposes.
Cincinnati Bancorp s primary source of liquidity is dividend payments, if any, received from the Bank. The Bank s ability
to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions. At September 30, 2016, Cincinnati Bancorp (on an unconsolidated, stand-alone
basis) had liquid assets of $337,000. 

At September 30, 2016, the Bank exceeded
all of its regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of $18.0 million, or 11.7% of adjusted total assets,
which is above the well-capitalized required level of $7.7 million, or 5.0%; total risk-based capital of $19.4 million, or 17.9%
of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $10.8 million, or 10.0%; and common equity tier
1 risk based capital of $18.0 million, or 16.6%, of risk weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of
$7.0 million, or 6.5%. At December 31, 2015, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage
capital level of $17.5 million, or 12.2% of adjusted total assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $7.2 million,
or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital of $18.8 million, or 18.6% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required
level of $10.1 million, or 10.0%. Accordingly, Cincinnati Federal was categorized as well capitalized at September 30, 2016, and
December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change its
category.
