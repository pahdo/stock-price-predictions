1  .    ORGANIZATION 
  Hyatt Hotels Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively "Hyatt Hotels Corporation") provide hospitality services on a worldwide basis through the development, ownership, operation, management, franchising and licensing of hospitality related businesses. We develop, own, operate, manage, franchise, license or provide services to a portfolio of properties consisting of full service hotels, select service hotels, resorts and other properties, including timeshare, fractional and other forms of residential or vacation properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , (i) we operated or franchised   307   full service hotels, comprising   120,528   rooms throughout the world, (ii) we operated or franchised   332   select service hotels, comprising   46,203   rooms, of which   307   hotels are located in the United States, and (iii) our portfolio of properties included   6   franchised all inclusive Hyatt-branded resorts, comprising   2,401   rooms. As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio of properties operated in   54   countries around the world.  
  As used in these Notes and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q  , (i) the terms "Company," "we," "us," or "our" mean Hyatt Hotels Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) the term "portfolio of properties" refers to hotels and other properties or residential ownership units that we develop, own, operate, manage, franchise, license or provide services to, including under our Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt, Andaz, Hyatt Centric, The Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Hyatt Place, Hyatt House, Hyatt Ziva, Hyatt Zilara and Hyatt Residence Club brands. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information, the instructions to Form   10-Q   and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information or footnotes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. As a result, this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q   should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes in our Annual Report on Form   10-K   for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "  2015   Form   10-K  "). 
  We have eliminated all intercompany accounts and transactions in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We consolidate entities under our control, including entities where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 
  Management believes the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are all of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods. 

2  .    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  Adopted Accounting Standards   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 ("ASU 2015-03"),   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The provisions of ASU 2015-03 are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2016, and as a result we reclassified   $5 million   of debt issuance costs previously included in other assets to long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015. 
  Future Adoption of Accounting Standards   In May 2014, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09"),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition,   and provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14 ("ASU 2015-14"),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  . ASU 2015-14 delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, making it effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date under ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09.

     Table of Contents  

In January 2016, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 ("ASU 2016-01"),   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . ASU 2016-01 revises the accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The provisions of ASU 2016-01 are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01. 
  In February 2016, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 ("ASU 2016-02"),   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to record lease contracts on the balance sheet by recognizing a right-of-use asset and lease liability. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02. 
  In June 2016, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 ("ASU 2016-13"),   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing impairment model for most financial assets from an incurred loss impairment model to a current expected credit loss model, which requires an entity to recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows the entity does not expect to collect. ASU 2016-13 also requires credit losses relating to available-for-sale ("AFS") debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The provisions of ASU 2016-13 are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13. 

3  .    EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS 
  We have investments recorded under both the equity and cost methods. These investments are an integral part of our business and are strategically and operationally important to our overall results. Our equity and cost method investment balances recorded at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

During the   three     months ended   September 30, 2016  , two unconsolidated hospitality ventures in which we hold or held an ownership interest and which are classified as equity method investments within our owned and leased hotels segment, each sold a Hyatt Place hotel, for which we received combined proceeds of   $7 million  . We recorded gains of   $5 million   in equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures on our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold an entity which held an interest in one of our foreign currency denominated equity method investments within our owned and leased hotels segment, for which we received proceeds of   $3 million  . In connection with the sale, we released   $21 million   of accumulated foreign currency translation losses, which were recorded to equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures on our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $0   and   $2 million   of net losses from our cost method investments, respectively. Gains or losses from cost method investments are recorded within other income (loss), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $2 million   and   $4 million   of impairment charges, respectively, in equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures on our condensed consolidated statements of income.

The following table presents summarized financial information for all unconsolidated hospitality ventures in which we hold an investment accounted for under the equity method: 

4  .    MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
  We hold marketable securities to fund certain operating programs and for investment purposes. We periodically transfer cash and cash equivalents to time deposits, highly liquid and transparent commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, and U.S. government obligations and obligations of other government agencies for investment purposes.  
  Marketable Securities Held to Fund Operating Programs   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our total marketable securities held to fund operating programs, which are recorded at fair value and included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, were as follows:

Net gains (losses) and interest income from marketable securities held to fund operating programs on the condensed consolidated statements of income included realized and unrealized gains and losses and interest income related to the following:  

Our captive insurance companies hold marketable securities which are classified as AFS and are invested in U.S. government agencies, time deposits and corporate debt securities. We classify these investments as current or long-term, based on their contractual maturity dates, which range from 2016 through 2021. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an insignificant unrealized loss and   $1 million   of unrealized gains, respectively, related to these AFS securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets through other comprehensive income (loss).

Marketable Securities Held for Investment Purposes   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our total marketable securities held for investment purposes, which are recorded at fair value and included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, were as follows: 

Fair Value   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we measured the following financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis: 

8 

     Table of Contents  

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. Our policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of each quarterly reporting period. We currently do not have non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  We invest a portion of our cash into short-term interest bearing money market funds that have a maturity of less than ninety days. Consequently, the balances are recorded in cash and cash equivalents. The funds are held with open-ended registered investment companies, and the fair value of the funds is classified as Level One as we are able to obtain market available pricing information on an ongoing basis. The fair value of our mutual funds is classified as Level One as they trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis. Time deposits are recorded at par value, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level Two. The remaining securities, other than our investment in preferred shares, are classified as Level Two due to the use and weighting of multiple market inputs being considered in the final price of the security. Market inputs include quoted market prices from active markets for identical securities, quoted market prices for identical securities in inactive markets, and quoted market prices in active and inactive markets for similar securities.

Preferred shares   During the year ended December 31, 2013, we invested   $271 million     in Playa Hotels   Resorts B.V. ("Playa") for redeemable, convertible preferred shares. We have the option to convert our preferred shares and any accrued and unpaid paid in kind ("PIK") dividends thereon into shares of common stock at any time through the later of the second anniversary of the closing of our investment or an initial public offering by Playa ("Playa IPO"). The preferred investment is redeemable at our option in August 2021. In the event of a Playa IPO or other equity issuance by Playa, we have the option to request that Playa redeem up to   $125 million   of preferred shares at par plus any accrued and unpaid PIK dividends thereon. As a result, we have classified the preferred investment as an AFS debt security, which is re-measured quarterly at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets through other comprehensive income (loss). The fair value of the preferred shares was:  

On September 27, 2016, Playa publicly filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in conjunction with its proposed initial public offering ("IPO") of common shares. In connection with the potential Playa IPO, we have committed to convert up to   $50 million   of our preferred shares at par plus any accrued and unpaid PIK dividends thereon at a conversion price equal to the lower of   $8.40   per share or the IPO price. The remaining preferred shares and any accrued and unpaid PIK dividends thereon are expected to be redeemed by Playa with IPO proceeds. The conversion and redemption are expected to close simultaneously with the Playa IPO. There is no assurance that Playa will complete its proposed IPO. In a transaction separate from their IPO, Playa redeemed   3,458,530   of our preferred shares plus accrued and unpaid PIK dividends thereon for   $41 million   in October 2016.  
  Due to the lack of availability of market data, the preferred shares are classified as Level Three. Historically, we estimated the fair value of the Playa preferred shares using an option-pricing model. As a result of the potential Playa IPO, we revised our valuation approach at   September 30, 2016   and utilized a hybrid of the option-pricing model and the probability-weighted expected return method, to estimate the fair value of our preferred shares. The hybrid model includes various scenarios, such as the successful completion of the Playa IPO and assumptions around conversion and redemption, as well as scenarios where we continue to use the option-pricing model. We assigned a probability to each scenario to arrive at our estimated fair value as of September 30, 2016. Our scenarios include assumptions regarding (i) a potential range of IPO prices and size of the offering, (ii) conversion of up to   $50 million   of our preferred shares into common shares of Playa and (iii) the redemption of   3,458,530   shares, which closed in October 2016. These option-pricing model scenarios include assumptions regarding the expected term, risk-free interest rate over the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and enterprise value. Financial forecasts were used in the computation of the enterprise value using the income approach, based on assumed revenue growth rates and operating margin levels. The risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital.   
  The option-pricing scenarios include variations of the expected term, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and dividend yield assumptions as follows: 

There is inherent uncertainty in our assumptions and fluctuations in these assumptions or the probabilities assigned to each scenario may result in different estimates of fair value. At   September 30, 2016  , the assumption which most significantly impacted the fair value of the preferred shares is the assignment of probabilities to each  
  
    10 

     Table of Contents  

potential scenario. A change to the assigned probabilities may cause the fair value to decrease up to   $15 million   and increase up to   $60 million  , representing the difference between the low and high end of the range of fair values based on each scenario. 
  Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had investments in held-to-maturity ("HTM") debt securities of   $25 million  , which are investments in third-party entities that own certain of our hotels. The amortized cost of our investments approximates fair value. The securities are mandatorily redeemable between 2020 and 2025. 

5  .    FINANCING RECEIVABLES 
  Our financing receivables at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

During the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , all of our outstanding secured financing receivables to hotel owners were settled. We received net cash proceeds of   $26 million  , an unsecured financing receivable of   $6 million  , and preferred equity investments of   $7 million  . The settlements of the secured financing receivables resulted in a net recovery of   $8 million  , which was recognized in other income (loss), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Allowance for Losses and Impairments   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the activity in our financing receivables allowance was as follows: 

11 

     Table of Contents  

Credit Monitoring   Our unsecured financing receivables were as follows: 

(1) The unpaid principal balance was   $45 million   and the average recorded loan balance was   $61 million   at    September 30, 2016  .  
   
 (2) The unpaid principal balance was   $42 million   and the average recorded loan balance was   $55 million   at    December 31, 2015  . 
  Fair Value   We estimated the fair value of financing receivables which are classified as Level Three in the fair value hierarchy to be approximately   $22 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. 

6  .    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 
  Acquisitions 
  Royal Palms Resort and Spa   During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired Royal Palms Resort and Spa from an unrelated third party for a net purchase price of approximately   $86 million  , net of   $2 million   of proration adjustments. Due to the iconic nature of the hotel, we retained the Royal Palms Resort and Spa name and added the hotel to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt. Of the   $88 million   purchase price, assets acquired and recorded in our owned and leased hotels segment consist of   $75 million   of property and equipment,   $9 million   of indefinite-lived brand intangibles, and   $1 million   of advanced bookings intangibles. We also recorded   $3 million   of management agreement intangibles in our Americas management and franchising segment, which are being amortized over a useful life of   20   years. The purchase of Royal Palms Resort and Spa was structured and identified as a replacement property in a potential reverse like-kind exchange agreement. 
  The Confidante Miami Beach   During the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired Thompson Miami Beach for a purchase price of approximately   $238 million  , from a seller indirectly owned by a limited partnership affiliated with the brother of our Executive Chairman. Of the   $238 million   purchase price, assets acquired consist of   $228 million   of property and equipment, which was recorded in our owned and leased hotels segment, and   $10 million   of management agreement intangibles, which were recorded in our Americas management and franchising segment and are being amortized over a useful life of   20   years. We rebranded this hotel as The Confidante Miami Beach, and added the hotel to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt. The purchase of

  Dispositions 
  Hyatt Regency Birmingham (U.K.)   During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold the shares of the company that owns Hyatt Regency Birmingham (U.K.) to an unrelated third party for approximately   $49 million  , net of closing costs and proration adjustments and entered into a long-term management agreement with the owner of the property. The sale resulted in a   $17 million   pre-tax gain which has been deferred and is being recognized in management and franchise fees over the term of the management agreement, within our EAME/SW Asia management segment. The operating results and financial position of this hotel prior to the sale remain within our owned and leased hotels segment.    
  Andaz 5th Avenue   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold Andaz 5th Avenue to an unrelated third party for   $240 million  , net of   $10 million   of closing costs and proration adjustments and entered into a long-term management agreement with the owner of the property. The sale resulted in a   $21 million   pre-tax loss which was recognized in gains (losses) on sales of real estate on our condensed consolidated statements of income during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The operating results and financial position of this hotel prior to the sale remain within our owned and leased hotels segment.    
  Hyatt Regency Indianapolis   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold Hyatt Regency Indianapolis to an unrelated third party for   $69 million  , net of closing costs and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the owner of the property. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of   $8 million  , which was recognized in gains (losses) on sales of real estate on our condensed consolidated statements of income during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The operating results and financial position of this hotel prior to the sale remain within our owned and leased hotels segment.  
  Land Held for Development   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold land and construction in progress for   $14 million   to an unconsolidated hospitality venture in which we have a   40%   ownership interest, for which we received   $12 million   in cash proceeds as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  A Hyatt House Hotel    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold a select service property to an unrelated third party for   $5 million  , net of closing costs, resulting in a   $1 million   pre-tax gain which was recognized in gains (losses) on sales of real estate on our condensed consolidated statements of income during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The operating results and financial position of this hotel prior to the sale remain within our owned and leased hotels segment. 
  As a result of certain dispositions, we have agreed to provide customary indemnifications to third-party purchasers for certain liabilities incurred prior to sale and for breach of certain representations and warranties made during the sales process, such as representations of valid title, authority, and environmental issues that may not be limited by a contractual monetary amount. These indemnification agreements survive until the applicable statutes of limitation expire, or until the agreed upon contract terms expire. 
  Like-Kind Exchange Agreements 
  Periodically, we enter into like-kind exchange agreements upon the disposition of certain hotels. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the proceeds from the sales are placed into an escrow account administered by a qualified intermediary. The proceeds are recorded to restricted cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and released once they are utilized as part of a like-kind exchange agreement or when a like-kind exchange agreement is not completed within the allowable time period.  
  In conjunction with the sale of   five   Hyatt Place properties during the year ended   December 31, 2014  , we entered into like-kind exchange agreements with a qualified intermediary. Pursuant to the like-kind exchange agreements, the combined net proceeds of   $51 million   from the sales of these hotels were placed into an escrow account administered by a qualified intermediary. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we released the net proceeds because the identified replacement property was not acquired in order to complete the exchange. 
  In conjunction with the sale of   thirty-eight   select service properties during the year ended   December 31, 2014  , we entered into like-kind exchange agreements with a qualified intermediary for   twenty-seven   of the select service hotels. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we utilized the net proceeds from   twenty-one   of the   twenty-seven   hotels as part of the like-kind exchange agreement to acquire Park Hyatt New York. During the   nine months ended    
  
    13 

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2015  , we released   $92 million   of net proceeds related to the remaining   six   hotels from restricted cash, as the intermediary distributed these funds from escrow to complete the reverse like-kind exchange transaction in connection with the acquisition of Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort and Spa. 

7  .    INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  The following is a summary of intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Amortization expense relating to intangible assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was as follows:   

8.        DEBT    
  Long-term debt, net of current maturities, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $1,447 million   and   $1,042 million  , respectively.  
  Senior Notes   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   $400 million   of   4.850%   senior notes due 2026, at an issue price of   99.920%   (the "2026 Notes"). We received net proceeds of   $396 million   from the sale of the   2026   Notes, after deducting discounts and offering expenses of approximately   $4 million  . We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay for the redemption of the 2016 Notes (as described below), with the remaining proceeds intended to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2016. 
  The 2026 Notes, together with our   $250 million   of   3.875%   senior notes repaid in 2016 (the "  2016   Notes"),   $196 million   of   6.875%   senior notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes"),   $250 million   of   5.375%   senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes"), and   $350 million   of   3.375%   senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes"), are collectively referred to as the "Senior Notes." 
  Debt Redemption   During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we redeemed all of our outstanding   2016   Notes, of which an aggregate principal amount of   $250 million   was outstanding. The redemption price, which was calculated in accordance with the terms of the 2016 Notes and included principal and accrued interest plus a make-whole premium, was   $254 million  . The make-whole premium was recorded within other income (loss), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income, see Note   17  .  
  Senior Secured Term Loan   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repaid the senior secured term loan related to Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort and Spa of   $64 million  . 
  Fair Value   We estimated the fair value of debt, excluding capital leases, which consists of our Senior Notes, bonds and other long-term debt. Our Senior Notes and bonds are classified as Level Two due to the use and weighting of multiple market inputs in the final price of the security. Market inputs include quoted market prices from active markets for identical securities, quoted market prices for identical securities in inactive markets, and quoted market prices in active and inactive markets for similar securities. We estimated the fair value of our other long-term  
  
    14 

     Table of Contents  

debt instruments using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market inputs for similar types of arrangements. Based upon the lack of availability of market data, we have classified our other long-term debt as Level Three. The primary sensitivity in these calculations is based on the selection of appropriate discount rates. Fluctuations in these assumptions will result in different estimates of fair value.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had the following debt balances, excluding capital lease obligations, as described above:

9  .    LIABILITIES 
  Other long-term liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities included   $176 million   and   $166 million   of liabilities related to the Hyatt Gold Passport Fund at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

10  .    INCOME TAXES 
  The effective income tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , were   30.2%   and   44.6%  , respectively. The effective income tax rates for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , were   28.4%   and   45.3%  , respectively. Our effective tax rates decreased for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the 2016 tax impact of global transfer pricing changes implemented during the fourth quarter of 2015 and a reversal of uncertain tax positions for certain filing positions in foreign jurisdictions recorded in the third quarter. In addition to the aforementioned items, the 2015 effective tax rates were higher compared to 2016 due to the effect of certain unconsolidated hospitality venture losses that were not fully benefited in 2015. 
  Unrecognized tax benefits were   $100 million   and   $110 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which   $13 million   and   $21 million  , respectively, would impact the effective tax rates if recognized.

11  .    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various commitments, guarantees, surety bonds, and letter of credit agreements, which are discussed below: 
  Commitments   At   September 30, 2016  , we committed, under certain conditions, to lend or invest up to   $366 million  , net of any related letters of credit, in various business ventures.  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into a commitment to fund up to   $50 million   of preferred equity in a third-party entity which is developing a hotel in Seattle, Washington, for which we also provided a debt repayment guarantee. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we also entered into a commitment to purchase land and a to-be-constructed hotel located in Portland, Oregon from the developer upon substantial completion of construction for a purchase price of approximately   $160 million  . 
  Performance Guarantees   Certain of our contractual agreements with third-party owners require us to guarantee payments to the owners if specified levels of operating profit are not achieved by their hotels.  
  Our most significant performance guarantee relates to four managed hotels in France that we began managing in the second quarter of 2013 ("the four managed hotels in France"), which has a term of   7 years  , with approximately   3.75   years remaining, and does not have an annual cap. The remaining maximum exposure related to our performance guarantees at   September 30, 2016   was   $416 million  , of which    344 million   (  $387 million   using exchange rates as of   September 30, 2016  ) related to the four managed hotels in France. 
  We had total net performance guarantee liabilities of   $73 million   and   $97 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which included   $59 million   and   $81 million   recorded in other long-term liabilities and   $14 million   and   $16 million   in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Our total performance guarantee liabilities are comprised of the fair value of the guarantee obligation liabilities recorded upon inception, net of amortization and any separate contingent liabilities, net of cash payments. Performance guarantee expense or income and income from amortization of the guarantee obligation liabilities are recorded in   other income (loss), net   on the condensed consolidated statements of income, see Note   17  .  
  The following table details the total performance guarantee liability: 

Additionally, we enter into certain management contracts where we have the right, but not an obligation, to make payments to certain hotel owners if their hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit. If we choose not to fund the shortfall, the hotel owner has the option to terminate the management contract. At    September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   amounts recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets related to these performance test clauses.

     Table of Contents  

Debt Repayment Guarantees   We enter into various debt repayment guarantees primarily related to our unconsolidated hospitality ventures and certain managed hotels. Typically, we enter into debt repayment guarantees in order to assist hotel owners in obtaining third party financing or to obtain more favorable borrowing terms. Included within debt repayment guarantees are the following: 

(1) We have agreements with either our unconsolidated hospitality venture partner, the respective hotel owners or other third parties to recover certain amounts funded under the debt repayment guarantee; the recoverability mechanism may be in the form of cash, notes receivable, or HTM debt securities.  
  (2) We have the contractual right to recover amounts funded from the unconsolidated hospitality venture, which is a related party. We expect our maximum exposure to be   $90 million  , taking into account our partner s   50%   ownership interest in the unconsolidated hospitality venture. 
  (3) Under certain events or conditions, we have the right to force the sale of the property(ies) in order to recover amounts funded.  
  (4) If certain funding thresholds are met or if certain events occur, we have the ability to assume control of the property  .       
  (5) We are subject to a completion guarantee whereby the parties agree to substantially complete the construction of the project by a specified date. In the event of default, we are obligated to complete construction using the funds available from the outstanding loan. Any additional funds paid by us are subject to recovery through a HTM debt security. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the hotel owners are current on their debt service obligations. 
  Insurance   We obtain commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability, workers' compensation, automobile liability, employment practices, crime, property and other miscellaneous coverages. A portion of the risk is retained on a self-insurance basis primarily through U.S. based and licensed captive insurance companies that are wholly owned subsidiaries of Hyatt and generally insure our deductibles and retentions. Reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Losses estimated to be paid within twelve months are   $40 million   and   $35 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, while losses expected to be payable in future periods are   $55 million   and   $57 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At   September 30, 2016  , standby letters of credit of   $7 million   were issued to provide collateral for the estimated claims, which are guaranteed by us. For further discussion, see the " Letters of Credit" section of this footnote.

     Table of Contents  

Collective Bargaining Agreements   At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   26%   of our U.S. based employees were covered by various collective bargaining agreements, generally providing for basic pay rates, working hours, other conditions of employment and orderly settlement of labor disputes. Generally, labor relations have been maintained in a normal and satisfactory manner, and we believe our employee relations are good. 
  Surety Bonds   Surety bonds issued on our behalf were   $24 million   at   September 30, 2016   and primarily relate to workers  compensation, taxes, licenses and utilities related to our lodging operations. 
  Letters of Credit   Letters of credit outstanding on our behalf as of   September 30, 2016   were   $238 million  , which relate to our ongoing operations and securitization of our performance under our debt repayment guarantee associated with the hotel properties in India, which is only called upon if we default on our guarantee. The letters of credit outstanding do not reduce the available capacity under our revolving credit facility.  
  Capital Expenditures   As part of our ongoing business operations, significant expenditures are required to complete renovation projects that were approved. 
  Other   We act as general partner of various partnerships owning hotel properties subject to mortgage indebtedness. These mortgage agreements generally limit the lender s recourse to security interests in the assets financed and/or other assets of the partnership(s) and/or the general partner(s) thereof. 
  In conjunction with financing obtained for our unconsolidated hospitality ventures and certain managed hotels, we may provide standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the other hospitality venture owners. 
  We are subject, from time to time, to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual obligations. Many of these claims are covered under current insurance programs, subject to deductibles. We recognize a liability associated with commitments and contingencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Although the ultimate liability for these matters cannot be determined at this point, based on information currently available, we do not expect the ultimate resolution of such claims and litigation will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

(b) The amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss was recognized within equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures on our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  Share Repurchase     During 2016, 2015, and 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $250 million  ,   $400 million   and   $700 million  , respectively, of our common stock. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, at prices we deem appropriate and subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in our sole discretion. The common stock repurchase program applies to our Class A common stock and/or our Class B common stock. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   5,556,424   and   9,614,463   shares of common stock, respectively. These shares of common stock were repurchased at a weighted-average price of   $48.25   and   $56.05   per share, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of   $268 million   and   $539 million  , respectively, excluding related insignificant expenses in both periods. The shares repurchased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   represented approximately   4%   of our total shares of common stock outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . The shares repurchased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   represented approximately   6%   of our total shares of common stock outstanding as of   December 31, 2014  . The shares of Class A common stock repurchased on the open market were retired and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares while the shares of Class B common stock repurchased were retired and the total number of authorized Class B shares was reduced by the number of shares repurchased. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $111 million   remaining under the share repurchase authorization. 
  Treasury Stock Retirement     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we retired   195,423   shares of treasury stock. These shares were retired at a weighted-average price of   $43.41   per share resulting in an   $8 million   reduction in treasury stock. The retired shares of treasury stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued. 

13  .    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  As part of our   Long-  Term Incentive Plan, we award Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), Performance Share Units ("PSUs") and Performance Vesting Restricted Stock ("PSSs") to certain employees. Stock-based compensation expense and unearned compensation presented below exclude amounts related to employees of our managed hotels and other employees whose payroll is reimbursed, as this expense has been and will continue to be reimbursed by our third-party hotel owners and is recorded in other revenues from managed properties and other costs from managed properties on our condensed consolidated statements of income. Stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general, and administrative expense on our condensed consolidated statements of income related to these awards for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

SARs   Each vested SAR gives the holder the right to the difference between the value of one share of our Class A common stock at the exercise date and the value of one share of our Class A common stock at the grant date. Vested SARs can be exercised over their life in accordance with the plan. All outstanding SARs have a   10  -year contractual term, are settled in shares of our Class A common stock and are accounted for as equity instruments. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   924,424   SARs to employees with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $14.52  . The fair value of each SAR was estimated on the grant date using the   Black-  Scholes-  Merton   option-  pricing model. 
  RSUs   Each vested RSU represents the right to receive a single share of our Class A common stock (or, in the case of an insignificant portion of total RSUs granted, its cash equivalent value). The value of the   stock-  settled RSUs is based on the fair value of our Class A common stock as of the grant date. We record compensation expense for RSUs over the vesting period of the individual award. Vesting is dependent upon continuous service by the employee, but will accelerate due to death or disability or in the event of a change in control. Compensation expense for retirement eligible grantees is recorded in full once the grantee becomes retirement eligible. In certain limited situations we also grant   cash-  settled RSUs which are recorded as liability instruments. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted a total of   444,629   RSUs (an insignificant portion of which are   cash-  settled RSUs) to employees which, with respect to   stock-  settled RSUs, had a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $47.36  .

     Table of Contents  

PSUs and PSSs   We granted both PSUs and PSSs to certain executive officers.  
  PSUs vest and are paid out in Class A common stock based upon the performance of the Company through the end of the applicable   three   year performance period relative to the applicable performance target. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted to our executive officers a total of   111,620   PSUs, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $47.36  . The performance period applicable to such PSUs is a   three   year period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2018. The PSUs will vest at the end of the performance period only if the performance threshold is met and continued service requirements are satisfied; there is no interim performance metric except in the case of certain change in control transactions. 
  PSSs vest and restrictions on transfer thereon lapse based upon the performance of the Company through the end of the applicable   three   year performance period relative to the applicable performance target. The PSSs vest in full if the maximum performance metric is achieved. At the end of the performance period, the PSSs that do not vest will be forfeited. The PSSs will vest at the end of the performance period only if the performance threshold is met and applicable continued service requirements are met; there is no interim performance metric except in the case of certain change in control transactions. 
  Our total unearned compensation for our   stock-  based compensation programs as of   September 30, 2016   was   $7 million   for SARs,   $15 million   for RSUs and   $2 million   for PSUs and PSSs, which will be recorded to compensation expense over the next   three years   with respect to SARs and RSUs, with a limited portion of the SAR and RSU awards extending to   four years  , and over the next   two years   with respect to PSUs and PSSs. 

14  .    RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  In addition to those included elsewhere in the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements,   related-  party transactions entered into by us are summarized as follows: 
  Leases   Our corporate headquarters have been located at the Hyatt Center in Chicago, Illinois, since 2005. A subsidiary of the Company holds a master lease for a portion of the Hyatt Center and has entered into sublease agreements with certain related parties. Future expected sublease income for this space from related parties is   $4 million  .  
  Equity Method Investments   We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. We recorded fees of   $8 million   and   $7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. We recorded fees of   $22 million   and   $19 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had receivables due from these properties of   $7 million   and   $6 million  , respectively. In addition, in some cases we provide loans (see Note   5  ) or guarantees (see Note   11  ) to these entities. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded fees related to these guarantees of   $1 million   and   $3 million  , respectively. Our ownership interest in these unconsolidated hospitality ventures generally varies from   24%   to   70%  . See Note   3   for further details regarding these investments.  
  Class B Share Repurchase   During the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   1,881,636   shares of Class B common stock for a weighted average price of   $53.15   per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $100 million  . The shares repurchased represented approximately   1%   of our total shares of common stock outstanding prior to the repurchase. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   1,776,501   shares of Class B common stock for a weighted average price of   $58.91   per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $105 million  . The shares repurchased represented approximately   1%   of our total shares of common stock outstanding prior to the repurchase. The shares of Class B common stock were repurchased in privately negotiated transactions from trusts for the benefit of certain Pritzker family members and limited partnerships owned indirectly by trusts for the benefit of certain Pritzker family members and were retired, thereby reducing the total number of shares outstanding and reducing the shares of Class B common stock authorized and outstanding by the repurchased share amount.  
  Class B Share Conversion   During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   500,000   shares of Class B common stock were converted on a share-for-share basis into shares of our Class A common stock,   $0.01   par value per share. The shares of Class B common stock that were converted into shares of Class A common stock have been retired, thereby reducing the shares of Class B common stock authorized and outstanding.

15  .    SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  Our reportable segments are components of the business which are managed discretely and for which discrete financial information is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. Our chief operating decision maker is the President and Chief Executive Officer. We define our reportable segments as follows:  
             
    Owned and leased hotels   This segment derives its earnings from owned and leased hotel properties located predominantly in the United States but also in certain international locations and, for purposes of segment Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), includes our pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures, based on our ownership percentage of each venture. 
                
    Americas management and franchising   This segment derives its earnings primarily from a combination of hotel management and licensing of our portfolio of brands to franchisees located in the United States, Latin America, Canada and the Caribbean. This segment s revenues also include the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel property owners and franchisees with no added margin. These costs relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where the Company is the employer. These revenues and costs are recorded within other revenues from managed properties and other costs from managed properties, respectively. The intersegment revenues relate to management fees collected from the Company s owned hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation. 
                
    ASPAC management and franchising   This segment derives its earnings primarily from a combination of hotel management and licensing of our portfolio of brands to franchisees located in Southeast Asia, as well as greater China, Australia, South Korea, Japan and Micronesia. This segment s revenues also include the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel property owners and franchisees with no added margin. These costs relate primarily to reservations, marketing and IT costs. These revenues and costs are recorded within other revenues from managed properties and other costs from managed properties, respectively. The intersegment revenues relate to management fees collected from the Company s owned hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation. 
                
    EAME/SW Asia management   This segment derives its earnings primarily from hotel management of our portfolio of brands located primarily in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, Central Asia and Nepal. This segment s revenues also include the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel property owners with no added margin. These costs relate primarily to reservations, marketing and IT costs. These revenues and costs are recorded within other revenues from managed properties and other costs from managed properties, respectively. The intersegment revenues relate to management fees collected from the Company s owned hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation. 
     Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based on each segment s revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; stock-based compensation expense; asset impairments; gains (losses) on sales of real estate;   other income (loss), net  ; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; and provision for income taxes. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA has been updated to exclude stock-based compensation expense, to facilitate comparison with our competitors. We have applied this change in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to 2015 historical results to allow for comparability between the periods presented.

  Executive Overview 
  We are a global hospitality company engaged in the development, ownership, operation, management, franchising and licensing of a portfolio of properties, including hotels, resorts and residential and vacation ownership properties around the world. As of   September 30, 2016  , our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of   639   hotels (  166,731   rooms), including: 

276   managed properties (  90,276   rooms), all of which we operate under management agreements with third-party property owners; 
                
    292   franchised properties (  48,267   rooms), all of which are owned by third parties that have franchise agreements with us and are operated by third parties; 
      
    28 

     Table of Contents  

20   managed properties and   9   franchised properties owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures (  7,892   rooms). 
     Our worldwide property portfolio also included: 
             
    6   all inclusive resorts (  2,401   rooms), all of which are owned and operated by an unconsolidated hospitality venture that has franchise agreements with us; 
                
    16   vacation ownership properties (  1,038   units), all of which are licensed by Interval Leisure Group ("ILG") under the Hyatt Residence Club brand and operated by third parties, including ILG and its affiliates; and 
                
    18   residential properties (  2,417   units), which consist of branded residences and serviced apartments. We manage all of the serviced apartments and those branded residential units that participate in a rental program with an adjacent Hyatt-branded hotel.  
     We report our consolidated operations in U.S. dollars. Constant currency disclosures throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are non-GAAP measures. See " Segment Results" below for further discussion of constant currency disclosures. We manage our business within four reportable segments as described below:      

Owned and leased hotels, which consists of our owned and leased full service and select service hotels and, for purposes of segment Adjusted EBITDA, our pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures, based on our ownership percentage of each venture; 

Americas management and franchising, which consists of our management and franchising of properties located in the United States, Latin America, Canada and the Caribbean; 

ASPAC management and franchising, which consists of our management and franchising of properties located in Southeast Asia, as well as greater China, Australia, South Korea, Japan and Micronesia; and 

EAME/SW Asia management, which consists of our management of properties located primarily in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, Central Asia and Nepal.  
     The results of our unallocated corporate overhead, license fees related to Hyatt Residence Club and our co-branded credit card are reported within corporate and other. See Note   15   for further discussion of our segment structure. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased Royal Palms Resort and Spa for approximately $88 million. The hotel is included in The Unbound Collection by Hyatt. 
  During the third quarter, we announced plans for the following future openings: 
             
    Hyatt Centric Carlisle Bay, the first Hyatt-branded hotel in Barbados; 
                
    Hyatt Regency Phnom Penh, the first Hyatt Regency in Cambodia; and 
                
    Hyatt Regency Zadar Maraska, the first Hyatt-branded hotel in Croatia. 
     We opened 11 hotels in the third quarter including Andaz Ottawa Byward Market, the first Andaz hotel in Canada. 
  On October 27, 2016, we announced a new global loyalty program, World of Hyatt, which will launch on March 1, 2017  . 
  Our financial performance for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   reflects an   increase   in net income of   $37 million   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Consolidated revenues   increase  d   $35 million  , or   3.3%   (  $39 million   or   3.7%   excluding the impact of currency), during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Owned and leased hotels revenues for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d   $19 million   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , which included net unfavorable currency impact of   $4 million  . The   increase   in owned and leased hotels revenues resulted primarily from an   increase   in non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues of   $13 million  , including   $1 million   in net unfavorable currency impact, which was primarily driven by new openings and acquisitions in 2016, partially offset by hotels sold in 2016. Additionally, comparable owned and leased hotels revenues   increase  d   $6 million  , including   $3 million   in net unfavorable currency impact, which was primarily driven by full service hotels in the United States and Mexico as a result of improved transient and group Revenue per Available Room ("RevPAR").

Our management and franchise fees for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d   $7 million   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , which included an insignificant net unfavorable currency impact. Fee   increase  s were primarily due to increased franchise fees from new and converted hotels and improved performance at existing hotels in the Americas. 
  Our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the   third   quarter of   2016     increase  d   $21 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , which included   $1 million   in net unfavorable currency impact. The   increase   was primarily driven by our owned and leased hotels segment which   increase  d   $10 million   and a   $5 million     increase   attributable to corporate and other. See " Non-GAAP Measures" below for an explanation of how we use Adjusted EBITDA, why we present it and material limitations on its usefulness, as well as a reconciliation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation 
  Hotel Chain RevPAR Statistics. 

(1) Comparable systemwide hotels include   one   select service hotel in ASPAC, which is not included in the ASPAC full service hotel statistics. The number of managed and franchised hotels presented above includes owned and leased hotels. 
  In the Americas management and franchising segment, transient Average Daily Rate ("ADR") growth as well as group occupancy and ADR growth at our full service hotels contributed to RevPAR increases in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, partly due to the shift of the Jewish holidays out of the third quarter of 2016 and into the fourth quarter of 2016. Our owned and leased hotels segment, which consists of hotels located primarily in the Americas, experienced transient revenue growth as a result of increased ADR in the third quarter of 2016. Group occupancy experienced moderate growth at our owned and leased hotels in the United States, due to the shift of the Jewish holidays out of the third quarter of 2016. 
  In the Americas management and franchising segment, short-term group bookings made in the third quarter of 2016 for stays in 2016 were lower compared to bookings made in the third quarter of 2015 for stays in 2015. Long-term bookings made in the third quarter of 2016 for stays beyond 2016 increased compared to bookings made in the third quarter of 2015 for years beyond 2015. 
  ASPAC management and franchising segment results for the   third   quarter of 2016 were relatively flat as the region continued to be negatively impacted by a shifting preference in tourism destinations. While overall demand remained strong, the region experienced decreased ADR during the third quarter of 2016. Our hotels in South Korea experienced improved results as the tourism industry has recovered after the country was negatively impacted by the MERS outbreak in 2015. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan markets experienced lower visitor arrivals and we expect this trend to continue. Hong Kong, however, had strong group results during the third quarter despite the difficult market conditions. 
  The RevPAR decline in our EAME/SW Asia management segment during the third quarter of 2016 resulted from decreased ADR and occupancy in France, Switzerland and Turkey. The hotels in France and Turkey continued to experience lower demand due to security concerns and terrorism in the region. Our hotel in Switzerland experienced reduced occupancy as a result of a decline in transient demand. These decreases were partially offset by a combination of strong rate and occupancy growth across Southwest Asia as the hotels continued to benefit from an improved business environment. We expect the current trends in the EAME/SW Asia regions to continue to impact the segment's results for 2016.

  Discussion on Consolidated Results 
  For additional information regarding our consolidated results below, please also refer to our condensed consolidated statements of income included in this quarterly filing. The impact from our investments in marketable securities held to fund operating programs, including securities held to fund our benefit programs funded through a rabbi trust and securities held to fund our Gold Passport program, were recorded on the various financial statement line items discussed below and have no impact on net income.  
  Owned and leased hotels revenues.     

The   increase  s in comparable owned and leased hotels revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were primarily driven by full service hotels in the United States and Mexico, partially offset by decreases at certain international hotels primarily due to net unfavorable currency impact and market weakness. The   increase  s in non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were driven by acquisitions and openings in 2016, partially offset by hotels sold in 2015 and 2016. See " Segment Results" below for further discussion of owned and leased hotels revenues.

The increase in management and franchise fees included an insignificant and   $2 million   net unfavorable currency impact during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in franchise fees for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by new and converted hotels and improved performance at existing hotels in the Americas. 
  Other revenues from managed properties  .     

Excluding the impact of rabbi trust, other revenues from managed properties   decrease  d during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to decreased full service hotels payroll and related costs driven by hotel conversions and a hotel that left the chain, partially offset by increased reimbursements related to our Hyatt Gold Passport program due to increased member participation. Excluding the impact of rabbi trust, other revenues from managed properties   increase  d during the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to a higher volume of reimbursements paid to us by our managed properties for increased member participation in our Hyatt Gold Passport program and increased select service hotels payroll and related costs, partially offset by decreased full service hotels payroll and related costs driven by hotel conversions and one hotel that left the chain.  
  Owned and leased hotels expense  .     

Comparable owned and leased hotels expense included   $2 million   and   $11 million   net favorable currency impact, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by increased payroll and related costs and property taxes at certain properties. Non-comparable owned and leased hotels expense included   $1 million   net favorable currency impact, in both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases in both periods were primarily driven by acquisitions and openings in 2016, partially offset by hotels sold in 2016 and 2015.

Depreciation and amortization  .    Depreciation and amortization   increase  d   $9 million   and   $21 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by depreciation for assets placed in service in 2015 and 2016 related to IT projects, acquisitions and hotel openings, partially offset by decreased depreciation related to the sale of Andaz 5th Avenue. A portion of the depreciation related to IT assets is recovered from our managed and franchised hotels and the corresponding recovery is included in other income (loss), net. 
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses.       

Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses excludes the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. See " Non-GAAP Measures" below for further discussion of adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses. Effective January 1, 2016 our definition of Adjusted EBITDA has been updated to exclude stock-based compensation expense, therefore, our definition of adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses has also been updated to exclude stock-based compensation expense. We have applied this change in the definition of adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses to 2015 historical results to allow for comparability between the periods presented. 
  Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses   decrease  d during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by reductions in professional fees related to certain initiatives completed during 2015 and other taxes assessed in the prior year. The decrease during the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year, was driven by reductions in professional fees, partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs.

Equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures  .     

The three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included $20 million of equity earnings attributable to one of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures primarily related to their debt refinancing, which resulted in a distribution during the third quarter of 2016, and $5 million related to two of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures which sold hotels during the third quarter. Equity earnings during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   also included $7 million related to a forfeited deposit on a sale of hotels that did not close. Additionally, during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $2 million   and   $4 million   of impairment charges, respectively. 
  The three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   included the sale of an entity that held an interest in one of our foreign currency denominated unconsolidated hospitality ventures which resulted in a loss of $21 million due to the release of accumulated foreign currency translation upon sale. The   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   also included $28 million of equity losses related to two foreign unconsolidated hospitality ventures. Such losses are attributable to the following, among other items: (i) foreign currency losses recorded by one of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures which holds loans denominated in a currency other than its functional currency, resulting in losses due to currency volatility during the period, and (ii) operating and non-operating losses related to one of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures driven primarily by interest, tax, and other nonrecurring expenses recorded during the period.  
  Interest expense  .    Interest expense   increase  d   $3 million   and   $6 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by interest expense related to the 2026 Notes issued in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by decreased interest expense related to the 2016 Notes which were redeemed during the second quarter of 2016. 
  Asset Impairments.      During the   three and nine     months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized $5 million of asset impairment charges related to property and equipment within our owned and leased hotels segment. 
  Gains (losses) on sales of real estate  .    During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold Andaz 5th Avenue resulting in a pre-tax loss of $21 million. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we sold Hyatt Regency Indianapolis resulting in a pre-tax gain of $8 million and a Hyatt House property resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1 million. 
  Other income (loss), net  .        Other income (loss), net     decrease  d   $7 million   and   increase  d   $4 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. These changes are primarily driven by performance guarantee income (expense), net related to the four managed hotels in France. See Note   11   for further details related to our performance guarantees.   Other income (loss), net   for

the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included foreign currency losses recorded by entities which hold loans denominated in a currency other than its functional currency, primarily related to the Brazilian real. Refer to Note 17 for a reconciliation of the components in   other income (loss), net  . 
  Provision for income taxes.  

Provision for income taxes increased $8 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to an increase in income in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by benefits described below. Income tax expense decreased $7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was due to a tax benefit recognized in 2016 as a result of the global transfer pricing changes implemented during the fourth quarter of 2015 to better align the methodology with our global business operating model and the release of tax reserves in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, the periods ended   September 30, 2015   were unfavorably impacted by the effect of certain foreign unconsolidated hospitality venture losses that were not fully benefited in 2015.

Owned and leased hotels revenues  .    

The   increase  s in comparable owned and leased hotels revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were primarily driven by   increase  s of   $12 million   and   $42 million   in the United States, respectively, partially offset by   decrease  s of   $6 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, at our international hotels. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , revenue growth at our United States comparable full service hotels was primarily a result of improved transient rate and food and beverage revenues. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , revenue growth at our United States comparable full service hotels was primarily a result of increased group and transient rates as well as food and beverage revenues. The   decrease  s in comparable international hotels during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in 2015, were primarily driven by net unfavorable currency impact of   $3 million   and   $17 million  , respectively. Unfavorable performance in EAME/SW Asia was partially offset by favorable performance in Mexico. The   increase  s in non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues were driven by the opening of Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro and the acquisitions of The Confidante Miami Beach and Royal Palms Resort and Spa, partially offset by the sale of Andaz 5th Avenue. 

Excluding the net unfavorable currency impact, the increase in comparable RevPAR at our owned and leased hotels during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily driven by improved transient ADR and group occupancy at our comparable full service hotels in the United States and Mexico, partially offset by decreased ADR at our comparable full service hotels in EAME/SW Asia. The increase during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily driven by improved ADR and occupancy at our comparable full service hotels in the United States and Mexico, partially offset by decreased ADR at our comparable full service hotels in EAME/SW Asia.

  Owned and leased hotels segment Adjusted EBITDA  .     

Owned and leased hotels Adjusted EBITDA  .  Adjusted EBITDA at our comparable owned and leased hotels   increase  d   $6 million   and   $14 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  , which included   $1 million   and   $5 million   in net unfavorable currency impact. These increases were largely due to revenue growth in the United States and Mexico. Partially offsetting the revenue growth in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were increased payroll and related costs and property taxes at certain properties. Adjusted EBITDA at our non-comparable hotels   increase  d   $2 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by the opening of Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro, partially offset by the sale of Andaz 5th Avenue. Adjusted EBITDA at our non-comparable hotels   decrease  d   $4 million   during the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the sale of Andaz 5th Avenue and the acquisition of The Confidante Miami Beach. 
  Pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA  .  Our pro rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated hospitality ventures included an insignificant currency impact during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015   were primarily driven by hotel openings and improved performance at hotels within two ventures that operate in resort markets.  
  In the event of successful completion of the Playa IPO, our common stock investment in Playa may be recharacterized as an investment in an equity security.  Depending on both the magnitude of the Playa IPO and the amount of our common stock ownership subsequent to the Playa IPO, we may no longer account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. In this situation, our share of Playa s results would no longer be included in our pro rata share of unconsolidated ventures Adjusted EBITDA, which comprised approximately one third of the pro rata share of unconsolidated ventures Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Excluding the favorable currency impact, the increase in comparable full service RevPAR during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was driven by increased occupancy in Hong Kong, South Korea and Southeast Asia. These increases were partially offset by decreased occupancy in Japan and decreased ADR in Hong Kong and certain hotels in Southeast Asia. Excluding the unfavorable currency impact, the increase in comparable full service RevPAR during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was driven by increased occupancy in most areas of China, South Korea and Southeast Asia. These increases were partially offset by decreased ADR in China and certain hotels in Southeast Asia.  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , no properties were removed from the comparable ASPAC full service systemwide hotels.

EAME/SW Asia management segment revenues.     

EAME/SW Asia management total revenues included an insignificant and   $1 million   net unfavorable currency impact, respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the unfavorable currency impact, the increase in both periods was primarily driven by an increase in other revenues from managed properties. 

Excluding the unfavorable currency impact, the decrease in comparable full service RevPAR during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in 2015, was driven by decreased ADR and occupancy in France, Switzerland and Turkey. These decreases were partially offset by increased ADR and occupancy in Eastern Europe and India. The nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 also included decreased ADR and occupancy in Africa.  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , two properties were removed from the comparable EAME/SW Asia full service systemwide hotel results as a result of significant renovations and no properties were removed from the comparable EAME/SW Asia select service systemwide hotel results. One of the properties removed from the comparable systemwide hotel results, Hyatt Regency Paris  toile, was removed this quarter as the renovation will take longer than originally anticipated. Removing this hotel from the comparable hotel results yielded an increase in EAME/SW Asia full service RevPAR of 300 basis points.

The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by a   $4 million     decrease   in adjusted selling, general, and administrative costs, primarily in professional fees, due to certain initiatives completed during 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by a   $5 million     increase   in revenues related to our co-branded credit card, partially offset by a corresponding   $3 million     increase   in other direct costs. 
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") and EBITDA 
  We use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA throughout this quarterly report. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as we define them, are non-GAAP measures. We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items: 
             
    equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; 
                
    stock-based compensation expense; 
                
    asset impairments; 
                
    gains (losses) on sales of real estate; 
                
    other income (loss), net  ; 
                
    depreciation and amortization; 
                
    interest expense; and 
                
    provision for income taxes. 
     Effective January 1, 2016, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, as defined below, have been updated to exclude stock-based compensation expense, to facilitate comparison with our competitors. We have applied this change in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to 2015 historical results to allow for comparability between the periods presented.  
  We calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA.

     Table of Contents  

Our board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA or some combination of both. 
  We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance and making compensation decisions. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not substitutes for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our management compensates for these limitations by reference to our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. See our condensed consolidated statements of income and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
  See below for a reconciliation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation. 
  Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses excludes the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis since it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance, both on a segment and consolidated basis. See " Results of Operations" above for a reconciliation of Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses to selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
  Constant dollar currency 
  We report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant dollar basis.  Constant dollar currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results. We calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior-period local currency financial results at the current period s exchange rates. These adjusted amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  We finance our business primarily with existing cash, short-term investments and cash generated from our operations. As part of our business strategy, we also recycle capital by using net proceeds from dispositions to support our acquisitions and new investment opportunities. When appropriate, we borrow cash under our revolving credit facility or from other third-party sources, and may also raise funds by issuing debt or equity securities as necessary. We maintain a cash investment policy that emphasizes preservation of capital. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $590 million   and   $503 million  , respectively. We believe that our cash position, short-term investments and cash from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our access to the capital markets, will be adequate to meet all of our funding requirements and capital deployment objectives for the foreseeable future. 
  
    46 

     Table of Contents  

We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity and/or debt securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  
  Recent Transactions Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , several transactions impacted our liquidity. See " Sources and Uses of Cash." 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $  45 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , as 2015 included the release of restricted cash from one of our captive insurance companies which was invested in marketable securities. Additionally, the timing of certain accruals also contributed to the decrease, which was partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    We acquired Thompson Miami Beach for approximately $238 million. 
                
    Capital expenditures were   $140 million   (see " Capital Expenditures" below). 
                
    We acquired Royal Palms Resort and Spa for a net purchase price of approximately $86 million.

    We sold the shares of the company that owns Hyatt Regency Birmingham (U.K.) for approximately $49 million, net of closing costs and proration adjustments. 
                
    We released $29 million from restricted cash related to the finalization from the Canada Revenue Agency in connection with the 2014 disposition of Park Hyatt Toronto. 
       During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  : 
             
    We released $143 million from escrow to cash and cash equivalents related to release of proceeds from like-kind exchanges.

Capital expenditures were   $185 million   (see " Capital Expenditures" below). 
                
    We had net purchases of $114 million of marketable securities and short-term investments related to Hyatt Gold Passport and our captive insurance companies. 
                
    We invested $29 million in unconsolidated hospitality ventures. 
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   5,556,424   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $268 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we repurchased 9,614,463 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $539 million.   
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued our 2026 Notes and received net proceeds of   $396 million  , after deducting discounts and offering expenses of approximately   $4 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , all of our outstanding   2016   Notes were redeemed for $250 million. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repaid the senior secured term loan of   $64 million   related to Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort and Spa. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we drew and subsequently repaid $110 million on our revolving credit facility. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we did not draw on our revolving credit facility.    
  We define net debt as total debt less the total of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We consider net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table provides a summary of our debt to capital ratios: 

(1) 
    Excludes approximately   $799 million   and   $692 million   of our share of unconsolidated hospitality venture indebtedness at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, substantially all of which is non-recourse to us and a portion of which we guarantee pursuant to separate agreements. 
     Capital Expenditures 
  We routinely make capital expenditures to enhance our business. We classify our capital expenditures into maintenance, enhancements to existing properties and investment in new properties under development or recently opened. We have been and will continue to be prudent with respect to our capital spending, taking into account our cash flow from operations. 
  The following is a summary of our capital expenditures during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

48 

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in maintenance expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015 is driven by decreased technology spending and decreased spending at domestic and international owned full service properties. The increase in enhancements to existing properties is driven by increased renovation activity at domestic owned full service properties and expenditures related to our new corporate office. Expenditures related to new properties under development or recently opened are primarily driven by construction spending on our development of a hotel in Brazil, which opened in early 2016, and two new select service hotels under development in the United States.  
  Senior Notes 
  The table below sets forth the outstanding principal balance of our Senior Notes at   September 30, 2016  . Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. 

We are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the indenture governing our Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  There was no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had available borrowing capacity of approximately   $1.5 billion   under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding undrawn letters of credit. 
  We are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Letters of Credit 
  We issue letters of credit either under the revolving credit facility or directly with financial institutions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   we had a total of   $238 million   and   $228 million  , respectively, in letters of credit issued directly with financial institutions. These letters of credit had weighted-average fees of   99   basis points at   September 30, 2016  . The range of maturity on these letters of credit was up to   five   years at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We have discussed those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our   2015   Form   10-K  . Since the date of our   2015   Form   10-K  , there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the methodologies or assumptions we apply under them.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In certain situations, we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objectives described above, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were a party to hedging transactions, including the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed below. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes due to our borrowing activities. Our objective is to manage the risk of interest rate changes on the results of operations, cash flows, and the market value of our debt by creating an appropriate balance between our fixed and   floating-  rate debt. We enter into interest rate derivative transactions from time to time, including interest rate swaps, in order to maintain a level of exposure to interest rate variability that we deem acceptable. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held no interest rate swap contracts. 
  Foreign Currency Exposures and Exchange Rate Instruments 
  We transact business in various foreign currencies and utilize foreign currency forward contracts to offset our exposure associated with the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from third-party debt, debt repayment guarantees and intercompany transactions.  
  The U.S. dollar equivalents of the notional amounts of the outstanding forward contracts, the majority of which relate to intercompany transactions, with terms of less than one year, were as follows (in U.S. dollars): 

We intend to offset the gains and losses related to our third-party debt, debt repayment guarantees and intercompany transactions with gains or losses on our foreign currency forward contracts such that there is a negligible effect on net income. The effect of these derivatives instruments within other income (loss), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income were gains of   $3 million   and   $16 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the effect of these derivative instruments within   other income (loss), net   were gains of   $12 million   and   $16 million  , respectively. We expect to continue this practice relating to our intercompany transactions, and may also begin to manage the risks associated with other transactional foreign currency volatility within our business.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures. 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.      We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.      There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.      Legal Proceedings. 
  We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings involving tort and other general liability claims, workers' compensation and other employee claims, intellectual property claims and claims related to our management of certain hotel properties. Most occurrences involving liability, claims of negligence and employees are covered by insurance with solvent insurance carriers. We recognize a liability when we believe the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in response to Item 1A. to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

Item 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  
  The following table sets forth information regarding our purchases of shares of Class A and Class B common stock during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    On February 18, 2016, we announced the approval of an expansion of our share repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $250 million of Class A and Class B common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $111   million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.

Item 5.      Other Information. 
  On November 1, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Retirement with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to retire 500,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "Class B Common Stock"). All 500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were converted into shares of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "Class A Common Stock"), in connection with the sale of 500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock by certain selling stockholders into the public market pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-196372) filed with the SEC on May 29, 2014. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires that any shares of Class B Common Stock that are converted into shares of Class A Common Stock be retired and may not be reissued. 
  Effective upon filing, the Certificate of Retirement amended our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the total authorized number of shares of capital stock of the Company by 500,000 shares. The total number of authorized shares of the Company is now 1,449,241,738, such shares consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares designated Class A Common Stock, 439,241,738 shares designated Class B Common Stock, and 10,000,000 shares designated Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share.

  (d)    whether any series shall have conversion privileges and, if so, the terms and conditions of conversion, including provision for adjustment of the conversion rate upon such events as the Board of Directors shall determine;

  (f)    whether any series shall have a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of that series, and, if so, the terms and amount of such sinking fund;

 AMENDED AND RESTATED SUMMARY OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.1 

Hyatt Hotels Corporation 
  Amended and Restated Summary of Non-Employee Director Compensation  
  (Effective January 1, 2017) 
    
  This Amended and Restated Summary of Non-Employee Director Compensation was adopted by the Board of Directors (the    Board   ) of Hyatt Hotels Corporation (   HHC   ) on September 7, 2016 and effective as of January 1, 2017 and supersedes and replaces all prior versions. 
    
  All non-employee Directors of HHC will be entitled to receive the following compensation pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Compensation Program (the    Program   ) effective on and after January 1, 2017: 
    
           I. 
    BOARD RETAINERS AND COMMITTEE FEES: 
     Members will be entitled to both annual retainers for service on the board of directors of HHC (the    Board   ) as well as service as members on any committee of the Board   1    in the following amounts: 
  Board Annual Retainers: 
             
    $75,000 annual cash retainer (   Annual Fee   ).  The Annual Fee will be paid on a quarterly basis.  Directors will receive a check for $18,750 after the end of each fiscal quarter, but may instead elect to receive all or a portion of the Annual Fee in shares of HHC Class A Common Stock (   Stock   ).  If shares of Stock are selected, the date of grant will be the 15th day of the last month of the quarter.  If the 15th falls on a day on which the principal stock exchange on which the Stock is traded is closed, then the date of grant will be the next following day on which such principal stock exchange is open.  The Stock will be reflected in the brokerage account established by HHC for the Director.  If a Director ceases to be a member of the Board before the grant date for any quarter (regardless of whether or not he or she has elected to receive Stock), the Director shall receive in cash a pro-rata portion of the $18,750 fee for such quarter based on the number of days in the quarter in which the Director served on the Board, payable at the same time as cash fees are paid generally to Directors for such quarter. 

$150,000 payable in the form of shares of Stock (   Annual Equity Retainer   ).   The Annual Equity Retainer will be paid on the date of HHC s annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected each year (the    Annual Meeting   ), payable in arrears for service since the prior Annual Meeting.  The Stock will be reflected in the brokerage account established by HHC for the Director.  If a Director ceases to be a member of the Board prior to the next Annual Meeting, then such Director shall receive a pro-rata Annual Equity Retainer based on the number of days during which the Director served as a Director, divided by the number of days between Annual Meetings, determined and payable at the Annual Meeting following the date such Director ceased to be a member of the Board.   
       
   1    Committee retainers and fees will be paid in cash only and Directors will not have the right to elect to receive Stock or RSUs in lieu of cash.    

Newly elected Directors will receive $75,000 payable in the form of Stock (   Initial Equity Retainer   ).  The Initial Equity Retainer will be granted on the date of election or appointment as a Director with a value of $75,000, determined by reference to the fair market value of the Company s Stock at the time of grant.  
          
  Committee Retainers  : 

$10,000 annual cash retainer for members of Committees other than Audit Committee   
       
   Committee Chair Retainers  :   2     
              
    $25,000 annual cash retainer for Compensation Committee Chair. 
               II. 
    DIRECTORS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 
                
    Directors may defer receipt of all or any portion of their Annual Fee and/or Annual Equity Retainer (collectively the    Retainer   ) pursuant to the Directors  Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended (the    Deferred Plan   ).   

Amounts in respect of the Annual Fee and/or Annual Equity Retainer deferred under the Deferred Plan will be denominated in restricted stock units (each an    RSU   ), which entitle the Director to receive shares of Stock (not subject to restrictions other than the minimum ownership requirements described below) at a set time in the future in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Plan.   

RSUs do not entitle the Director to rights as a stockholder unless and until Stock is delivered in respect of the RSUs.  Stock will be issued and delivered in settlement of the RSUs automatically on the earlier of the Director s termination of service as a Director for any reason or a change of control (within the meaning of the Deferred Plan).  However, at the time of the applicable deferral election, a Director may elect to instead have the Stock delivered in settlement of the RSUs on the earlier of the fifth calendar year after deferral or a change of control (within the meaning of the Deferred Plan).   3      
       
   2    Committee Chairs receive only the Committee Chair retainer and not the committee retainer.  The Committee Chair Retainers and Committee Retainers will be paid in quarterly installments at the end of the quarter based on the Committee Chair s and member of Committee s service for such quarter.    
    
   3    Unless the five year deferral is selected, delivery of stock will occur in a lump sum on January 31st of the year following the Director s termination of service.  Delivery of the Stock cannot be accelerated other than on termination as a Director or Change in Control.  Delivery of the Stock may be re-deferred beyond five years, but such deferral must be for at least an additional five years and the election to delay delivery must be made at least 12 months prior to the year in which the Stock was otherwise to be delivered.   
  
   2 

RSUs will carry dividend equivalent rights for each RSU.  In the event that HHC pays dividends, dividend equivalent rights entitle the Director to receive cash payments equal to the dividends they would have received on the RSUs had the RSUs constituted outstanding shares of Stock at the time of such dividends (with such dividend equivalent amounts distributed to the Director at the same time as the underlying RSUs to which they relate). 
       
           III. 
    OTHER TERMS 
                
    Deferral Elections  :  To the extent a Director desires to defer receipt of all or any part of the Retainers under the Deferred Plan, such election must be made in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Plan on or prior to December 31 of the calendar year prior to the calendar year to which the Retainer relates.  Once an election to defer is made and becomes irrevocable, it may be revoked and changed only for future years.   
                
    Calculation of Number of Shares of Stock or RSUs  :  The number of shares of Stock to be delivered to a Director or shares subject to RSUs credited under the Deferred Plan will be calculated by dividing the dollar amount of the relevant entitlement by the fair market value of a share of Stock on the date of the grant.  Only whole shares of Stock or RSUs will be issued by rounding up to the next whole share of Stock, except with respect to the Annual Fee, where any remaining partial value for a fiscal quarter will be accumulated and allocated to the next fiscal quarter, however, in the last fiscal quarter, the value of the grant will be rounded up to the next whole share of Stock.  

Vesting  :  All shares of Stock and RSUs (and shares of Stock issued in settlement thereof) will be immediately vested. 
                
    Minimum Required Ownership  :  Each non-employee Director must accumulate and own, directly or indirectly, at least 5 times the Annual Fee ($375,000) worth of the Company s common stock (or common stock equivalents held under the Deferred Plan) at all times during his or her tenure on the Board; provided, that non-employee Directors will have up to five (5) years of service on the Board to meet this ownership requirement.  If the market value of a Director s stock should fall below 5 times the Annual Fee (following the relevant accumulation period), such Director shall not be permitted to sell any of the Company s common stock until the market value shall once again exceed 5 times the Annual Fee (other than in connection with a change of control transaction). 
       
           IV. 
    CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR STOCK AND RSUs:   
                
    Directors will be taxed as ordinary income on the value of the Stock on the date the Stock is issued and delivered.  The capital gain and Rule 144 holding periods both begin on such date.   
     
   3 

Directors will   not   be taxed on RSUs until the actual shares are issued and delivered.  At that time, the value of the shares delivered will be taxable as ordinary income.  For purposes of Rule 144 and capital gain tax rules, the relevant  holding period  does   not   begin until the shares (as opposed to RSUs) are actually issued.
