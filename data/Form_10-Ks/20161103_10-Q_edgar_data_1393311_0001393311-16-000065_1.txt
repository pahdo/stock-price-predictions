(Unaudited) 

1.      Description of the Business 

Public Storage (referred to herein as  the Company ,  we ,  us , or  our ), a Maryland real estate investment trust   ( REIT )  , was organized in 1980.  Our principal business activities include the ownership and operation of self-storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use  , ancillary activities such as   merchandise sales and tenant reinsurance to the tenants at our self-storage facilities, as well as the acquisition and development of additional self-storage space.   

At   September   30, 2016, we have direct and indirect equity interests in   2,  31  9   self-storage facilities (with approximately   1  5  2   million net rentable square feet) located in   38   states in the United States ( U.S. ) operating under the  Public Storage  name.  We also own   one   self-storage facility in London, England and we have a   49  % interest in Shurgard Europe, which owns   21  7   self-storage facilities (with approximately   12   million net rentable square feet) located in   seven   Western European countries, all operating under the  Shurgard  name.  We also have direct and indirect equity interests in approximately   29   million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in   nine   states in the U.S. primarily owned and operated by PS Business Parks, Inc. ( PSB ) under th  e  PS Business Parks  name.  At September   30, 2016, we have an approximate   42  % common equity interest   in PSB. 

Disclosures of the number and square footage of facilities, as well as the number and coverage of tenant reinsurance policies (Note 11) are unaudited and outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s review of our financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). 

2.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

We have prepared the accompanying interim financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) as set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (the  Codification ) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB"), and in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In our opinion, the interim financial statements presented herein reflect all adjustments, of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary to fairly present the interim financial statements.  Because they do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements, these interim financial statements should be read together with the audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

On our statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reclassified the $13.7 million we paid for the restricted share units that we withheld upon their vesting for   employee   tax requirements   fro  m a reduction in cash flows   from   operating activit  ies to a reduction in   cash flows from financing activities.  This reclassification was   in connection with a recently issued accounting pronouncement related to employee share-based payment accounting we early adopted effective January 1, 2016 (see  Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Guidance  below). 

Consolidation and Equity Method of Accounting 

We consider entities to be Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) when they have insufficient equity to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by other parties, or the equity holders as a group do not have a controlling financial interest.  We consolidate VIEs when we have (i) the power to direct the activities most significantly impacting economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation  

7   

PUBLIC STORAGE 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September 30, 2016 

(Unaudited) 

to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE.  We have   no   involvement with any material VIEs.  We consolidate all other entities when we control them through voting shares or contractual rights.  The entities we consolidate, for the period in which the reference applies, are referred to collectively as the  Subsidiaries , and we eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.   

We account for our investments in entities that we do not consolidate but have significant influence over using the equity method of accounting.  These entities, for the periods in which the reference applies, are referred to collectively as the  Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities , eliminating intra-entity profits and losses and amortizing any differences between the cost of our investment and the underlying equity in net assets against equity in earnings as if the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entity were a consolidated subsidiary.   

When we begin consolidating an entity, we record a gain representing the differential between the book value and fair value of any preexisting equity interest.  All changes in consolidation status are reflected prospectively. 

Collectively, at September 30, 2016, the Company and the Subsidiaries own   2,307     self-storage facilities in the U.S.,   one   self-storage facility in London, England and   three   commercial facilities in the U.S.  At September 30, 2016, the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities are comprised of PSB, Shurgard Europe, as well as limited partnerships that own an aggregate of   12   self-storage facilities in the U.S.  

Use of Estimates 

The financial statements and accompanying notes reflect our estimates and assumptions.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

Income Taxes 

We have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax if we distribute   100%   of our REIT taxable income each year, and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we have met these REIT requirements for all periods presented herein.  Accordingly, we have recorded   no   federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income.  

Our merchandise and tenant reinsurance operations are subject to corporate income tax and such taxes are included in ancillary cost of operations.  We also incur income and other taxes in certain states, which are included in general and administrative expense.   

We recognize tax benefits of uncertain income tax positions that are subject to audit only if we believe it is more likely than not that the position would ultimately be sustained assuming the relevant taxing authorities had full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances of our positions.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   no   tax benefits that were not recognized.  

Real Estate Facilities 

Real estate facilities are recorded at cost.  We capitalize all costs incurred to develop, construct, renovate and improve facilities, including interest and property taxes incurred during the construction period.  We expense internal and external transaction costs associated with acquisitions or dispositions of real estate, as well as repairs and maintenance costs, as incurred.  We depreciate buildings and improvements on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging generally between   5   to   25   years.

PUBLIC STORAGE 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September 30, 2016 

(Unaudited) 

We allocate the net acquisition cost of acquired operating self-storage facilities to the underlying land, buildings, identified intangible assets, and any noncontrolling interests that remain outstanding based upon their respective individual estimated fair values.  Any difference between the net acquisition cost and the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.   

Other Assets 

Other assets primarily consist of rents receivable from our tenants, prepaid expenses and restricted cash. 

Accrued and Other Liabilities 

Accrued and other liabilities consist primarily of rents prepaid by our tenants, trade payables, property tax accruals, accrued payroll, accrued tenant reinsurance losses, and contingent loss accruals when probable and estimable  .  We   believe the fair value of our accrued and other liabilities approximates book value, due to the short period until repayment.  We disclose the nature of significant unaccrued losses that are reasonably possible of occurring and, if estimable, a range of exposure.  

Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Other Financial Instruments 

Cash equivalents represent highly liquid financial instruments such as money market funds with daily liquidity or short-term commercial paper or treasury securities maturing within three months of acquisition.  Cash and cash equivalents which are restricted from general corporate use are included in other assets.  Commercial paper not maturing within three months of acquisition, which we intend and have the capacity to hold until maturity, are included in marketable securities and accounted for using the effective interest method.  We believe that the book value of all such financial instruments for all periods presented approximates fair value, due to the short period to maturity. 

Transfers of financial assets are recorded as sales when the asset is put presumptively beyond our and our creditors  reach, there is no impediment to the transferee s right to pledge or exchange the asset, we have surrendered effective control of the asset, we have no actual or effective right or requirement to repurchase the asset and, in the case of a transfer of a participating interest, there is no impediment to our right to pledge or exchange the participating interest we retain.  

Fair Value  

As used herein, the term  fair value  is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  Our estimates of fair value involve considerable judgment and are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges. 

We estimate the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, other assets, debt, and other liabilities by applying a discount rate to the future cash flows of the financial instrument.  The discount rate is based upon quoted interest rates for securities that have similar characteristics such as credit quality and time to maturity; such quoted interest rates are referred to generally as  Level 2  inputs.   

Currency and Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, certain portions of other assets including rents receivable from our tenants and restricted cash.  Cash equivalents

(Unaudited) 

we invest in are either money market funds with a rating of at least AAA by Standard and Poor s, commercial paper that is  rated A1 by Standard and Poor s or deposits with highly rated commercial banks.  

At September 30, 2016, due primarily to our investment in Shurgard Europe (Note 4) and our senior unsecured notes denominated in Euros (Note 5), our operating results and financial position are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the Euro, and to a lesser extent, other European currencies, against the U.S. Dollar.   

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets are comprised of goodwill, the  Shurgard  trade name, acquired customers in place, and leasehold interests in land.  

Goodwill totaled   $174.6   million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The  Shurgard  trade name, which is used by Shurgard Europe pursuant to a fee-based licensing agreement, has a book value of   $18.8   million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Goodwill and the  Shurgard  trade name have indefinite lives and are not amortized. 

Acquired customers in place and leasehold interests in land are finite-lived and are amortized relative to the benefit of the customers in place or the benefit to land lease expense to each period.  At September 30, 2016, these intangibles had a net book value of   $19.  1   million (  $18.0   million at December 31, 2015).  Accumulated amortization totaled   $5  1.6   million at September 30, 2016 (  $66.4   million at December 31, 2015), and amortization expense of   $  15.8   million and   $21.3     million was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The estimated future amortization expense for our finite-lived intangible assets at September 30, 2016 is approximately   $4.2   million in the remainder of 2016,   $7.6   million in 2017 and   $  7.3   million thereafter.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, intangibles were increased   $  16.9   million in connection with the acquisition of self-storage facilities (Note 3).   

Evaluation of Asset Impairment 

We evaluate our real estate and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter.  If there are indicators of impairment and we determine that the asset is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows to be received through the asset s remaining life (or, if earlier, the expected disposal date), we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the asset s estimated fair value or net proceeds from expected disposal.   

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated real estate entities for impairment on a quarterly basis.  We record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds estimated fair value, when we believe any such shortfall is other than temporary.    

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever relevant events, circumstances and other related factors indicate that fair value of the related reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount.  If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the aggregate carrying amount, no impairment charge is recorded.  Otherwise, we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the amount that would be allocated to goodwill if the reporting unit were acquired for estimated fair value.   

We evaluate the  Shurgard  trade name for impairment at least annually and whenever relevant events, circumstances and other related factors indicate that the fair value is less than the carrying amount.  When we conclude that it is likely that the asset is not impaired, we do not record an impairment charge and no further

analysis is performed.  Otherwise, we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.   

No   impairments were recorded in any of our evaluations for any period presented herein. 

Revenue and Expense Recognition 

Revenues from s  elf-storage facilities, which are   primarily composed of rental income earned pursuant to month-to-month leases for storage space, as well as associated late charges and administrative fees, are recognized as earned.  Promotional discounts reduce rental income over the promotional period, which is generally one month.  Ancillary revenues and interest and other income are recognized when earned.  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities represents our pro-rata share of the earnings of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.   

We accrue for property tax expense based upon actual amounts billed and, in some circumstances, estimates when bills or assessments have not been received from the taxing authorities.  If these estimates are incorrect, the timing and amount of expense recognition could be incorrect.  Cost of operations, general and administrative expense, interest expense, as well as advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred.   

Foreign Currency Exchange Translation  

The local currency (primarily the Euro) is the functional currency for our interests in foreign operations.  The related balance sheet amounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates at the respective financial statement date, while amounts on our statements of income are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective period.  When financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar are expected to be settled in cash in the foreseeable future, the impact of changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent are reflected in current earnings.  The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately   1.1  21   U.S. Dollars per Euro at September 30, 2016 (  1.091   at December 31, 2015), and average exchange rates of   1.1  16   and   1.112   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and average exchange rate  s   of   1.116   and   1.115   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Cumulative translation adjustments, to the extent not included in cumulative net income, are included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  

Comprehensive Income  

Total comprehensive income represents net income, adjusted for changes in other comprehensive income (loss) for the applicable period.  The aggregate foreign currency exchange gains and losses reflected on our statements of comprehensive income are primarily related to our investment in Shurgard Europe and our senior unsecured notes denominated in Euros. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Guidance 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from   Contracts with Customers,   which requires revenue to be based upon the consideration expected from customers for promised goods or services.  The new standard, effective on January 1, 2018, permits either the retrospective or cumulative effects transition method and allows for early adoption on January 1, 2017.  We do not believe this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, primarily becau  se most of our revenue is from rental revenue  , which this standard does not cover   and because we do not provide any material associated services to our tenants  .

PUBLIC STORAGE 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September 30, 2016 

(Unaudited) 

In August, 2014, the   FASB   issued new accounting guidance, which is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern     for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.      This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.      Early adoption is permitted.      The Company anticipates no impact upon adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,   which modifies (i) the criteria for and the analysis of the identification of consolidation of variable interest entities,   particularly when fee arrangements and related party relationships are involved, and (ii) the consolidation analysis for partnerships.  We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, which did not change the consolidation status of any entities in which we have an interest; however, certain entities began to be considered VIE s as a result of the change.   

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases,   which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting.  The new standard, effective on January 1, 2019, requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief and allows for early adoption on January 1, 2016.   We do not believe this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  , because substantially all of our lease revenues are derived from month-to-month self-storage leases, and we do not have material amounts of lease expense  . 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  We early adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016.  Under this standard, a share-based compensation-related tax liability paid on behalf of employees in lieu of shares received is classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows, rather than as an operating activity as we had previously presented such amounts.  We applied this provision retrospectively.  The standard also allows a company to choose, with respect to recording share-based expense, between (i) recognizing forfeitures only as they occur or (ii) estimating future forfeitures in advance.  We chose to recognize forfeitures only as they occur, rather than estimating in advance, accordingly, effective January 1, 2016, under the modified retrospective transition method as required by the standard, we recorded a cumulative-effect   adjustment of   $  789,000   to   increase accumulated deficit and increase paid-in capital for the impact of estimated future forfeitures after December 31, 2015 (Note 9). 

Net Income per Common Share 

Net income is allocated to (i) noncontrolling interests based upon their share of the net income of the Subsidiaries, (ii) preferred shareholders, to the extent redemption cost exceeds the related original net issuance proceeds (an  EITF D-42 allocation ), and (iii) the remaining net income allocated to each of our equity securities based upon the dividends declared or accumulated during the period, combined with participation rights in undistributed earnings.   

Basic and diluted per common share are each calculated based upon net income allocable to common shareholders presented on the face of our income statement, divided by (i) in the case of basic net income per common share, weighted average common shares, and (ii) in the case of diluted income per share, weighted average common shares adjusted for the impact, if dilutive, of stock options outstanding (Note 9).  The following table reconciles from basic to diluted common shares outstanding:

During the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, we acquired   32   self-storage facilities (  2,329  ,000     net rentable square feet), for a total cost of   $  270  .  6   million, consisting of   $  257  .7   million in cash and the assumption of   $12.9   million in mortgage debt.  Approximately   $  1  6.9   million of the total cost was allocated to intangible   assets.  We completed development   and   re  development activities during the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, adding   1,432  ,000   net rentable square feet of self-storage space, at an aggregate cost of   $  1  61.9   million.  Construction in process at   September   30, 2016 consists of projects to develop new self-storage

At September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the  Other Investments  include an   average   26%     common equity ownership in limited partnerships that collectively own   12   self-storage facilities.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold   one   of the Other Investments resulting in a   $  689,000     gain     on real estate investment sales on our income statement.    In the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Other Investments had   $11.8   million in self-storage revenues,   $3.5   million in self-storage operating expenses,   $396,000   in depreciation expense, and   $50,000   in general and administrative and other expenses (amounts represent   100%   of the operations of these entities, not our pro rata share  ).     

During the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, we received cash distributions from our investments in the Unconsolidated Real Estate   Entities totaling   $  139.9   million   and   $  26.1   million, respectively.  For the   nine months     ended September 30, 2016, $  67.4   million of the distributions received exceeded the retained earnings of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities and   are presented as an investing activity on our statement of cash flows.  At September 30, 2016, the   cost of our investment in the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities exceeds our pro rata share of the underlying equity by   approximately   $57.0   million (  $62.0   million   at December 31, 2015).  This differential is being amortized as a reduction in equity in earnings of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities based upon allocations to the underlying net assets.  Such amortization was approximately   $  1.3   million and   $  2.8   million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  .

Credit Facility 

We have a revolving credit agreement (the  Credit Facility ) with   a     $500   million   borrowing limit  , which expires on   March 31, 2020  .  Amounts drawn on the Credit Facility bear annual interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus   0.850%   to LIBOR plus   1.450%     depending upon the ratio of our Total Indebtedness to Gross Asset Value (as defined in the Credit Facility) (LIBOR plus   0.850%   at   September   30, 2016).    We   are   also   required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from   0.080%   per annum to   0.250%   per annum depending upon the ratio of our Total Indebtedness to our Gross Asset Value (  0.080%   per annum at   September   30, 2016)  .  At   September   30, 2016 and   November 2  , 2016, we had   no     outstanding   borrowings under this Credit Facility.

The Senior Unsecured Notes consist  s   of two tranches  ,   (i)      242  .0     million (  2.175%   fixed rate of interest)   which   matures in   November 2025   and   (ii)    100  .0   million (  1.54%   fixed rate of interest), which was issued on   April 12, 2016   for   $113.6   million in net proceeds upon converting   the Euros to U.

We     reflect   changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the amount payable, as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates as  foreign currency exchange gain (  loss)  on our income statement (losses of     $  3.7     million   and   $6.0   million     for the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively).  The Senior   Unsecured   Notes have various customary financial covenants, all of which we   were in compliance with at   September     30, 2016. 

Mortgage Notes 

During the   nine months   ended   September   30  , 2016  , we assumed mortgage notes   with   aggregate   contractual values   of     $12.9   million and   interest rates   of   4.2%  , which approximated market rates,   in connection with the acquisition of real   estate facilities. 

The carrying   amounts of our mortgage notes (the  Mortgage Notes ) at   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, totaled   $  47.5   million and   $55.1   million, respectively, which approximates contractual note values   and estimated fair values  .  These notes were assumed in connection with acquisitions of real estate facilities and recorded at fair value with any premium or discount to the stated note balance amortized using the effective interest method.  At   September   30, 2016, the notes are secured by   3  4   real estate facilities with a net book value   of approximately   $  16  8.8   million, have   contractual interest rates between   2.9%   and   7.1%  , and mature between   Decem  ber 2016   and   September 2028  .

(Unaudited) 

The holders of our Preferred Shares have general preference rights with respect to liquidation, quarterly distributions and any accumulated unpaid distributions.  Except under certain conditions and as noted below, holders of the Preferred Shares will not be entitled to vote on most matters.  In the event of a cumulative arrearage equal to   six   quarterly dividends, holders of all outstanding series of preferred shares (voting as a single class without regard to series) will have the right to elect   two   additional members to serve on our board of trustees (the  Board ) until the arrearage has been cured.  At   September   30, 2016, there were   no   dividends in arrears. 

Except under certain conditions relating to the Company s qualification as a REIT, the Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to the dates indicated on the table above.  On or after the respective dates, each of the series of Preferred Shares is redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at   $25.00   per depositary share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  Holders of the Preferred Shares cannot require us to redeem such shares. 

Upon issuance of our Preferred Shares, we classify the liquidation value as preferred equity on our balance sheet with any issuance costs recorded as a reduction to paid-in capital. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we called our Series O and Series P Preferred Shares for redemption at par.  The aggregate redemption amount, before payment of accrued dividends, was   $270.0   million, of which   $125.0   million   for our Series P Preferred Shares was paid on October 8, 2015.  We recorded   $4.1   million and   $8.9   million in EITF D-42 allocation of income from our common shareholders to the holders of our Preferred Shares in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, in connection with these redemptions.

8  .      Related Party Transactions 

B. Wayne Hughes, our former Chairman and his family, including his daughter Tamara Hughes Gustavson and his son B. Wayne Hughes, Jr., who are both members of our Board of Trustees, collectively own   approximately   14.3%   of our common   shares outstanding at   September   30, 2016. 

At   September   30, 2016, B. Wayne Hughes and Tamara Hughes Gustavson together owned and   controlled   5  5   self-storage facilities in Canada.  These facilities operate under the  Public Storage  tradename,   which we license   to the owners of these facilities for use in Canada on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis.  Our subsidiaries reinsure risks relating to loss of goods stored by customers in these facilities, and have received   approximately   $  606,000   and   $  397,000     for the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Our right to continue receiving these premiums may be qualified.  We have   no   ownership interest in these facilities and we do not own or op  erate any facilities in Canada.    If we chose to acquire or develop our own facilities in Canada, we would have to share the use of the  Public Storage  name in Canada with the facilities  owners.  We have a right of first refusal, subject to limitations, to   acquire the stock or assets of the corporation engaged in the operation of these facilities ( PS Canada ) if their owners agree to sell them.    

9.      Share-Based Compensation 

Under various share-based compensation plans and under terms established by our Board of Trustees or a committee thereof, we grant non-qualified options to purchase the Company s common shares, as well as restricted share units ( RSUs ), to trustees, officers, and key employees.    

Stock options and RSUs are considered  granted  and  outstanding  as the terms are used herein, when (i) the Company and the recipient reach a mutual understanding of the key terms of the award, (ii) the award has been authorized, (iii) the recipient is affected by changes in the market price of our stock, and (iv) it is probable that any performance and service conditions will be met.    

As noted under  Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Guidance  in Note 2, we have elected to account for forfeitures of share-based payments as they occur, rather than estimating them in advance.  Accordingly, we recorded a cumulative-effect   adjustment of   $789,000   to increase   accumulated deficit and increase paid-in capital as of January 1, 2016, representing the impact of estimated forfeitures on our cumulative share-based compensation expense recorded through December 31, 2015. 

We amortize the grant-date fair value of awards as compensation expense over the service period, which begins on the grant date and ends on the vesting date.  For awards that are earned solely upon the passage of time and continued service, the entire cost of the award is amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period. For awards with performance conditions, the individual cost of each vesting is amortized separately over each individual service period (the  accelerated attribution  method).  

See also  net income per common share  in Note 2 for further discussion regarding the impact of RSUs and stock options on our net income per common share and income allocated to common shareholders. 

Stock Options 

Stock options vest over a   three   to   five  -year period, expire   ten   years after the grant date, and the exercise price is equal to the closing trading price of our common shares on the grant date.  Employees cannot

require the Company to settle their award in cash.  We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options.   

Outstanding stock option grants are included on a one-for-one basis in our diluted weighted average shares, to the extent dilutive, after applying the treasury stock method (based upon the average common share price during the period) t  o assumed exercise proceeds and   measured but unrecognized compensation. 

For the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, we recorded   $1.  2   million and   $  3.  2   million, respectively, in compensation expense related to stock options, as compared to   $0.  9   million   and   $  2.4   million, for the same periods in     2015. 

During the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016,   29  5,  000   stock options were granted,   132,61  4   options were exercised and   no   options were forfeited.  A total of   2,  102,665   stock options were outstanding at   September   30, 2016 (  1,940,279   at   December 31, 2015).  

Restricted Share Units 

RSUs generally vest ratably over a   five   to   eight  -year period from the grant date.  The grantee receives dividends   for each outstanding RSU equal to the per-share dividends received by our common shareholders.  We expense any dividends previously paid upon forfeiture of the related RSU.  Upon vesting, the grantee receives common shares equal to the number of vested RSUs, less common shares withheld in exchange for tax deposits made by the Company to satisfy the grantee s statutory tax liabilities arising from the vesting.   

The fair value of our RSUs is determined based upon the applicable closing trading price of our common shares.  

During the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016,   158,78  4   RSUs were granted,   21,240     RSUs were forfeited and   13  8,208   RSUs vested.  This vesting resulted in the issuance of   83,569     common shares.  In addition, tax deposits totaling $13.  6     million   ($13.7   million   for the same period in 2015) were made on behalf of employees in   exchan  ge for   5  4,639   common shares withheld upon vesting.  RSUs outstanding at   September   30, 2  016 and December 31, 2015 were   7  36,724   and   737,388  , respectively.   

A total of   $  10.  2   million   and   $  2  4.  7   million in RSU expense was recorded for the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, which includes approximately   $  40,000   and   $1.  1   million  ,    respectively,   in employer taxes incurred upon vesting, as compared to   $  9.0   million and   $22  .0   million for the same periods in 2015, which includes approximately   $  30,000   and   $1.0   million, respectively  , in employer   taxes incurred   upon vesting.

Self-Storage Operations  

The Self-Storage Operations segment reflects the rental operations from all self-storage facilities owned by the Company and the Subsidiaries.  Our CODM reviews the net operating income ( NOI ) of this segment, which represents the related revenues less cost of operations (prior to depreciation expense), in assessing performance and making resource allocation decisions.  The presentation in the tables below sets forth the NOI of this segment, as well as the depreciation expense for this segment, which while reviewed by our CODM and included in net income, is not considered by the CODM in assessing performance and decision making.  For all periods presented, substantially all of our real estate facilities, goodwill and other intangible assets, other assets, and accrued and other liabilities are associated with the Self-Storage Operations segment.  

Ancillary Operations 

The Ancillary Operations segment reflects the sale of merchandise and reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by our self-storage tenants, activities which are incidental to our primary self-storage rental activities.  Our CODM reviews the NOI of these operations in assessing performance and making resource allocation decisions.   

Investment in PSB 

This segment represents   our   42%   equity interest in PSB, a publicly-traded REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant flex, office, and industrial space.  PSB has a separate management team that makes its financing, capital allocation, and other significant decisions.  In making resource allocation decisions with respect to our investment in PSB, the CODM reviews PSB s net income, which is detailed in PSB s periodic filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and as included in Note 4.  The segment presentation in the tables below includes our equity earnings from PSB.   

Investment in Shurgard Europe 

This segment represents our   49%   equity interest in Shurgard Europe, which owns and operates self-storage facilities located in seven countries in Western Europe.  Shurgard Europe has a separate management team reporting to our CODM and our joint venture partner.  In making resource allocation decisions with respect to our investment in Shurgard Europe, the CODM reviews Shurgard Europe s net income, which is detailed in Note 4.

Contingent Losses 

We are a party to various legal proceedings and subject to various claims and complaints; however, we believe that the likelihood of these contingencies resulting in a material loss to the Company, either individually or in the aggregate, is remote. 

Insurance and Loss Exposure  

We have historically carried property, earthquake, general liability, employee medical insurance and workers compensation coverage   through internationally recognized insurance carriers, subject to deductibles.  Deductibles for property and general liability are   $25  .0   million and   $2  .0   million, respectively, per occurrence.  The aggregate limits on these policies of   $75  .0   million for property losses and   $102  .0   million for general liability losses are higher than estimates of maximum probable losses that could occur from individual catastrophic events determined in recent engineering   and actuarial studies; however, in case of multiple catastrophic events, these limits could be exceeded. 

We reinsure a program that provides insurance to our customers from an independent third-party insurer.  This program covers tenant claims for losses to goods stored at our facilities as a result of specific named perils (earthquakes are not covered by this program), up to a maximum limit of   $5,000   per storage unit.  We reinsure all risks in this program.  We are   subject to licensing requirements and regulations in several states.  At   September   30, 2016, there were   approximately   910  ,000   certificates held by our self-storage customers, representing aggregate coverage of approximately   $2.7   billion  . 

12.      Subsequent Events 

On October 14  , 2016, we   issued   14.0   million depositary shares,   each representing   1/1  ,000 of a share of our   4.90  % Series E Preferred Shares, at an issuance price of   $25.00   per depositary share, for a total of   $350.0   million   in gross proceeds, and we incurred   $  11.9   million   in   issuance costs. 

Subsequent to   September   30  ,    2016  , we acquired or were under contract to acquire   21   self-storage facilities (  eleven   in Oklahoma,   four   each in Ohio and Tennessee, and   one   each in Texas and   California  ), with   1.7   million net rentable square feet, for   $1  49.5   million.

Cri  tical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States ( U.S. ) generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and are affected by our judgments, assumptions and estimates.  The notes to our September 30, 2016 financial statements, primarily Note 2, summarize our significant accounting policies.  

We believe the following are our critical accounting policies, because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Income Tax Expense:    We have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we have met these REIT requirements for all periods presented herein.  Accordingly, we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income.  

Our evaluation that we have met the REIT requirements could be incorrect, because compliance with the tax rules requires factual determinations, and circumstances we have not identified could result in noncompliance with the tax requirements in current or prior years.  For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years, we could be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income would be materially different from the amounts estimated in our financial statements.   

In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as regular corporations.  To the extent that amounts paid to us by our taxable REIT subsidiaries are determined by the taxing authorities to not be reasonable when compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments.  Such a penalty tax could have a material adverse impact on our net income. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:    The analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity.  Others could come to materially different conclusions.  In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment.  Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income. 

Accrual for Uncertain and Contingent Liabilities:    We accrue for certain contingent and other liabilities that have significant uncertain elements, such as property taxes, workers compensation claims, tenant reinsurance claims, as well as other legal claims and disputes involving customers, employees, governmental agencies and other third parties.  Such liabilities we are aware of are estimated based upon many factors such as assumptions of past and future trends and our evaluation of likely outcomes.  However, the estimates of known liabilities could be  

29   

incorrect or we may not be aware of all such liabilities, in which case our accrued liabilities and net income could be misstated.   

Accounting for acquired real estate facilities:        We estimate the fair values of the land, buildings and intangible assets acquired for purposes of allocating the purchase price.  Such estimates are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including (i) market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets, (ii) building and material cost levels, (iii) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions, and (iv) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base.  Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets. 

Overview 

Our self-storage operations generated most of our net income for all periods presented.  Accordingly, a significant portion of management s time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities, as well as seeking additional investments in self-storage facilities.   

Most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends.  We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name  Public Storage,  and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively.   

We plan on growing our business organically, as well as through acquisition and development of additional facilities.    Since the beginning of   2013   through September 30, 2016  , we acquired a total of   214   facilities from third parties for approximately $  2.0   billion.    Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we acquired or were under contract to acquire   21   self-storage facilities   for $149.5 million  .    We will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities   and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire.   

Since the beginning of 201  3 th  rough September 30, 2016  , we have opened   n  ewly developed and redeveloped   projects with a total cost of $468.8 million, adding approximately 4.4 million net rentable square feet.  As of September 30, 2016, we had additional projects which will add approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet of storage space   at a total cost of approximately    $  68  8.  2   million  .    We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

We believe that our real estate development activities are beneficial to our business operations over the long run.  However, in the short run, development activities dilute our earnings due to the three to four year period that it takes to fill up newly developed and redeveloped storage facilities and reach a stabilized level of cash flows offset by the cost of capital to fund the development cost, combined with related overhead expenses flowing through general and administrative expense.  We believe this dilution will increase in the remainder of 2016 and beyond, because of an increased level of   un  stab  i  lized newly developed and redeveloped facilities in our portfolio and continued development efforts.  

We also have equity investments in Shurgard Europe and PS Business Parks, Inc. ( PSB ).  We may make further investments in these companies.   

As of September 30,   2016, our capital resources over the next year are e  xpected to be approximately $1.1   billion which exceeds our current planned capital needs over the next year of approximately $  594.0 million  .  Our capital resources include: (i) $57.2 million of cash as of September 30, 2016, (ii) $484.8 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (iii)   approximately   $  25  0.0 million of expected retained operating cash flow for the next twelve months, and (iv) $338.1 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our Series E Preferred Shares on October 14, 2016.    Retained   operating cash flow represents our expected cash   flow provided by operating activities, less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain real estate facilities.   

30   

Our planned capital needs over the next year consist of (i)   $426.8 million   of remaining spend on our current development pipeline, (  ii) $149.5 million in property   acquisitions currently under contract,   and (iii) $  17  .7 million   in principal repayments on existing debt.  Our capital needs may increase significantly over the next year as we expect to increase our development pipeline and acquire additional properties.  We may also redeem outstanding preferred securities   or repurchase shares of our common stock   in the future.   

See   Liquidity and Capital Resources   for further information regarding our capital requirements and anticipated sources of capital to fund such requirements.   

Results of   Operations  

Operating results for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $309.0 million or $1.78 per diluted common share, compared to $273.5 million or $1.58 in 2015 representing an increase of $35.5 million or $0.20.  The increase is primarily due to (i) a $28.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and (ii) an $8.0 million decrease in income allocated to preferred shareholders. 

The $28.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of an $18.1 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $10.2 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities (as defined below).  Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 5.1% or $26.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 6.4% or $8.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increased property taxes, on-site property manager payroll, and allocated overhead.  The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 308 self-storage faciliti  es acquired, developed or redevelop  ed since January 2013.  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $831.1 million or $4.78 per diluted common share, compared to $750.0 million or $4.32 in 2015 representing an increase of $81.1 million or $0.46.  The increase is primarily due to (i) a $107.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income offset partially by (ii) an $18.0 million increase in allocation to our preferred shareholders as a result of redemption activities and (iii) a $28.1 million reduction in gains on sales of real estate investments, including our equity share. 

The $107.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $76.3 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $30.8 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities.  Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 5.8% or $86.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.5% or $10.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increased property taxes, on-site property manager payroll and repairs and maintenance, offset partially by lower snow removal costs.  The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 308 self-storage faciliti  es acquired, developed or redevelop  ed since January 2013. 

Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations 

Funds from Operations ( FFO ) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts.  FFO represents net income before real estate depreciation, gains and losses, and impairment charges, which are excluded because they are based upon historical real estate costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions.  FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share.  FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows.  In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be   helpful. 

31   

For   the three months ended   September   30, 2016  , FFO   was $2.51 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.27 for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of 10.6%, or $0.24 per diluted common share. 

For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , FFO was $6.94 per diluted common share, as compared to $6.33 for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of 9.6%, or $0.61 per diluted common share. 

The following tables reconcile diluted earnings per share   to FFO per share and set forth the computation of FFO per share: 

We also present  Core FFO per share,  a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impac  t of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses,   (ii) EITF   D-42 charges related to the redemption   of preferred securities, (iii) general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisition of self-storage facilities and (iv) certain other noncash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items.  We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe it is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner.  However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share.  Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.  

The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share:

Analysis of Net Income by Reportable Segment 

The following discussion and analysis is presented and organized in accordan  ce with Note 1  0   to our   September 30, 2016   financial statements,  Segment Information.   Accordingly, refer to the t  ables presented in Note   1  0   in order to reconcile such amounts to our total net income and for further information on our reportable segments. 

Self-Storage Operations 

Our self-storage operations are analyzed in two groups:   (i) the 2,000 facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2014 (the  Same Store Facilities ), and (ii) all other facilities, which are newly acquired, newly developed, or recently   redevelop  ed (the  Non   Same Store Facilities ).  See Note 1  0   to our   September 30, 2016 financial statements  Segment Information,  for a reconciliation of the amounts in the tables below to our total net income. 

33   

(a) 

Net operating income or  NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, which is based upon historical real estate costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions.  We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating   property   operating trends.  We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner.  NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.    See Note 10 to our September 30, 2016 financial statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our total net income for all periods presented.     

Net operating income from our self-storage operations has increased 6.6% and 8.9% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  These increases are due to higher revenues in our Same Store Facilit  ies, as well as the acquisition and development   of new facilities and the fill-up of unstabilized facilities.   

34   

Same Store Facilities 

The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues and cost of operations since January 1, 2014.  We review the operations of our Same Store Facilities, which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as facilities damaged by casualty events, as well as recently developed or acquired facilities, to more effectively evaluate the ongoing   performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2014, 2015, and 2016.  We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner.  The Same Store pool decreased from the 2,003 facilities at June 30, 2016 to 2,000 facilities at September 30, 2016  ,   due primarily to   casualty damage.    The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,000 facilities (127.2 million net   rentable square feet) that represent   approximately 84%   of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at   September   30, 2016.  

35   

(a) 

Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities.     

(b) 

Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period.  Realized annual rent per available square foot ( REVPAF ) is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.  These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue.  Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins.  In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates.  These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.      

(c) 

Annual contract rent represents the applicable annualized contractual monthly rent charged to our tenants, excluding the impact of bad debt expense, promotional discounts, late charges and administrative fees.     

Analysis of Same Store Revenue 

Reve  nues generated by our Same Store   Facilities increased by   5.1  % and   5.8  % in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015 due primarily to increase  s of 5.2% and 5.8%     for   the respective periods in realized annual rental income per occupied square foot.  The increase in realized annual rental income per occupied square foot was due primarily to   the cumulative impact from   annual rent increases given to existing tenants  . 

Same Store weighted average square foot occupa  ncy remained essentially flat at 95.3% and 94.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared   to the same periods in 2015.    At September 30, 2016 and 2015, occupancy was flat at 94.2%.  W  e do not expect any significant impact from occupancy changes in the near term because we believe we are near limitations to occupancy levels inherent with   approximately 5% to 7% o  f our tenant base   vacating each month without notice.   

We believe that high occupancies help maximize our rental income.  We seek to maintain a weighted average square foot occupancy level of at least 90%, by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our marketing efforts on both television and the Internet in order to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate.  Demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy.  Demand is higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months. 

Increasing rental rates to existing tenants, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth.  We determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs.  We expect to continue to pass similar rent increases to long-term tenants in the remainder of 2016 as we did the same periods in 2015. 

Annual contract rent per occupied square foot was $17.1  4 and $16.26   at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.4%.    At   September 30, 2016 and 2015, annual contract rent per occupied square foot increased to $17.70 and $16.91, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.7%.  These increases were primarily driven by annual rate increases given to our longer tenured tenants, partially offset by the net impact of replacing vacating tenants with new tenants with lower contract rates. This  rent roll down  has been more pronounced in the current year quarter than the same period last year and has resulted in a reduction of the year-over-year growth rate in annual contract rent per occupied square foot.    During the three months   ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average annualized contractual rates per occupied square foot for tenants that moved in were $15.11 and $15.29, respectively, and for tenants th  at vacated were $16.24   and $15.67,   respectively.   

Annual contract rent per occupi  ed square foot was $16.77 and $15.83   at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.    At   September 30, 2016 and 2015, annual contract rent per occupied square foot increased to $17.70 and $16.91, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.7%.  These increases were primarily driven by annual rate increases given to our longer tenured tenants, partially offset by the net impact of replacing vacating tenants with new tenants with lower contract rates which has  

36   

been more pronounced during 2016 than the same period last year.  This  rent roll down  has been more pronounced during the first nine months of 2016 than the same period last year and has resulted in a reduction of the year-over-year growth rate in annual contract rent per occupied square foot.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average annualized contractual rates per occupied square foot for tenants that moved in were $14.86 and $14.62, respectively, and for tenants that vacated were $15.67 and $15.01, respectively.   

Promotional discounts   given, based upon the move-in contractual rates for the related promotional period, totaled $24.4 million and $65.8 million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $24.4 million and $65.5 million for   the same periods in 2015.   

We believe rental growth in the remainder of 2016 will need to come   primarily   from continued annual rent increases to existing tenants.  Our future rental growth will also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including demand for self-storage space, the level of new supply of self-storage space and the average length of stay of our tenants.   

We believe that the current trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents and occupancy levels are consistent with our expectation of continued revenue growth in the remainder of 2016.  However, such trends, when viewed in the short-run, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they are subject to many short-term factors.  Such factors include initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, the unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants. 

We expect year-over-year growth in our Same Store revenues will   continue to   moderate   in the remainder of 2016  .  We are experiencing softness in demand in   many of our major markets, most notably   Houston, Denver, Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.  , which has led to a lack of pricing power with respect to new tenants.    We attribute some of this softness to local economic conditions and, in some markets, increased supply of newly cons  tructed self-storage facilities,   including facilities that we have constructed. 

We are taking a number of actions to improve demand into our system, including   (i)   increasing marketing spend on the Internet     and television, and (ii) reducing rental rates   and increasing promotional discounts   to new tenants  .  Even if these actions are successful in improving demand into our system, in at least the near term, we believe these actions will have a negative impact on our   revenue   trends. 

Analysis of Same Store Cost of Operations    

Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and   amortization) increased   6.4  % and   2.5  % in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll and repairs   and maintenance expense (excluding snow removal cost), and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, offset partially by red  uced snow removal cost and   utilities. 

Property tax expense increased 5.4% and 4.9% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to higher assessed values.  We expect property tax expense growth of   approximately 5%   in the remainder of 2016 due primarily to higher assessed values. 

On-site property manager payroll   expense   increased 6.7  % and   4.3  % in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due   primarily to reductions in prior estimates of workers compensation costs recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , higher   employee   health care expenses   experienced in the three months ended September 30, 2016,   and higher wage rates.    We   expect   on-site property manager payroll expense     in the remainder of 2016   to increase comparably with the increase in the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015,   due to   higher employee health care costs and     wage increases   due primarily to changes in minimum wage laws  . 

37   

Supervisory payroll expense, which   represents compensation paid to the management personnel who directly and indirectly supervise the on-site property   managers, increased 3.6% and 2.9% in   the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015 due primarily to higher wage rates.  We expect inflationary increases in compensation   rates in the remainder of 2016.   

Repairs and   maintenance   expense increased 5.7% and decreased   9.0  % in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  Repair and maintenance costs include snow removal expense totaling $3.  3   million and $8.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease in snow removal costs was   due to less snowfall in the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.  Excluding snow removal costs, repairs and maintenance increased   7.2  % in the   nine months ended September 30  , 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. 

Repairs and maintenance expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact repair and maintenance needs including snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events.  We expect inflationary increases in repairs and maintenance expense in the remainder of 2016, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and not predictable.   

Our utility expenses are comprised primarily of electricity costs, which are dependent upon energy prices and   usage levels.    Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature.  Utility expense decreased   0.5  % and   4.2  % in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to lower usage as a result of milder weather.    It is difficult to estimate future utility costs, because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and not predictable.  However, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity rates, we expect inflationary increases in rates.   

Advertising and selling expense is comprised principally of Internet advertising, television advertising and the operating costs of our telephone reservation center.  Advertising and selling expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors; television and Internet   advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short   run in response to these factors.  Advertising and selling expenses increased   8.9  % and decreased   2.6  % in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to reduced   television advertising costs in the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2015.  As mentioned above, we have increased our Internet marketing expenditures and   beginning in late August 2016, we increased   our television adverti  sing expenditures   due to softness in demand in several of our larger markets.  As a result, we expect advertising a  nd selling expense to increase   in the three months end  ing     December   31  , 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Other direct property costs include administrative expenses incurred at the self-storage facilities, such as property insurance, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the facilities  cash receipts, credit card fees, and the cost of   operating each property s rental office including supplies and telephone data communication lines.  These costs increased   4.0  % and 2.9% in   the   three   and nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016,   respectively,   as compared to the same period  s    in 2015.  The increase  s     were   due primarily to higher credit card fees, offset partially by lower property insurance costs.  Credit card fees increased due to a higher proportion of collections being received from credit cards and higher revenues.  We expect moderate increases in other direct property costs in the remainder of 2016.  

Allocated overhead represents administrative expenses for shared general corporate functions, which are allocated to self-storage property operations to the extent their efforts   are devoted to self-storage operations.  Such functions include data processing, human resources, operational accounting and finance, marketing, and costs of senior executives (other than the Chief   Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are included in general and administrative expense).  Allocated overhead increased   24.8  % and   8.9  % in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to   an acceleration of the timing of our annual field staff   sales   meetings to the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015   which resulted in an increase of $1.6 million  .  The remainder of the increase is due to   increased compensation costs.  We expect   moderate   growth in allocated overhead in the remainder of 2016 as compared to 2015   due to inflationary wage increases and increased headcount  .

Analysis of Same Store Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and   amortization for Same Store   Facilities decreased 1.6% and 1.4% during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared   to the same periods in 2015.  We expect similar decreases in the remainder of 2016 as compared to 2015  . 

The following table summarizes selected quarterly financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities: 

39   

Analysis of   Market   Trends 

The following table sets forth   selected market   trends in our Same Store Facilities: 

40   

41   

We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows.  It is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results.  Over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics.   

Non Same Store Facilities 

The Non Same Store Facilities at September 30,   2016 represent   308   facilities   that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since January 1, 2014, or that we did not own as of January 1, 2014  .  As a result of the stabilization process and timing of when the facilities were acquired, year-over-year changes can be significant.   

The following table summarizes operating data with respect to the Non Same Store Facilities: 

42   

43   

The facilities included above under  2016 acquisitions  ,     2015 acquisitions,   2014 acquisitions  and  2013 acquisitions,  were acquired at a   cost of $270.6 million  , $168.8 million, $430.7 million, and $  938.3     mi  llion, respectively.    

For the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, the weighted average annualized yield on cost, based upon net operating income, for the facilities acquired in each of 2015  , 2014 and   2013 was 5.9%, 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively.  The yields for the facilities acquired in the nine months ended September 30,   2016 were not meaningful due to our limited ownership period.      

We believe that our management and operating infrastructure allows us to generate higher net operating income from newly acquired facilities than was achieved by the previous owners.  However, it can take 24 or more months for us to fully achieve the higher net operating income, and the ultimate levels of net operating income to be achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions.  As a result, there can be no assurance that we will   achieve our expectations with respect to these newly acquired facilities.   

Since the beginning of 2013, we have opened newly developed facilities with a total cost of $335.5 million and redeveloped existing facilities, expanding their square footage, for a total cost of $133.3 million.  The newly developed facilities are included in  Developed facilities  and the redeveloped facilities are included in  Other facilities  in the table above.  We believe that our real estate development activities are beneficial to our business operations over the long run.  However, in the short run, development activities dilute our earnings due to the three to four year period that it takes to fill up newly developed and redeveloped storage facilities and reach a stabilized level of cash flows offset by the cost of capital to fund the development cost, combined with related overhead expenses flowing through general and administrative expense.  We believe this dilution will increase in the remainder of 2016 and beyond, because of an increased level of unstabilized newly developed and redeveloped facilities in our portfolio and continued development efforts. 

We expect the Non Same Store Facilities to continue to provide increased net operating income in the remainder of 2016 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels and the earnings of the 2015 acquisitions are reflected in our operations for a longer period in 2016 as compared to 2015.   

We also expect to increase the number and net rentable square feet of Non Same Store Facilities over at least the next 24 months through development of new sel  f-storage facilities,   re  development of   existing facilities and  

44   

acquisitions of facilities.   

As of September 30, 2016, we had development and   redevelopment   projects which will add approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $6  88.2   million  .    Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval.  We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that   meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

Subsequent to   September 30  ,    2016,   we acquired or were under contract to acquire 21 self-storage facilities (eleven in Oklahoma, four each in Ohio and Tennessee, and one each in Texas and California), with 1.7 million net rentable square feet, for $149.5 million.        We will continue to seek to acquire facilities in the remainder of 2016; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance we will continue to be successful.   

Depreciation and amortization with respect to the Non Same Store Facilities increased $  4.7   million and $5.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015  .  Included in   depreciation and amortization is amortization of intangible assets, which represent  s   the value of the tenants   in place at the time the facilities are acquired and are amortized relative to the benefit of the tenants to each period.  The increases in the three and   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015 were due primarily to the acquisition   and development of additional facilities.    Based   upon the   facilities we own at September 30, 2016, amortization expense with respect to intangibles is estimated at $4.2 million   for the remainder of 2016.  The level of future depreciation and amortization will also depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities, as well as the level of newly developed storage space. 

Ancillary Operations 

Ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities in the U.S. and the sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities.  The following table sets forth our ancillary operations: 

Tenant reinsurance operations:     Our   tenants have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their goods stored at our facilities.  A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of Public Storage fully reinsures such policies,   and thereby assumes   all risk of losses under these policies    

45   

from the insurance company  .  The subsidiary receives   reinsurance premiums, substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants, from the non-affiliated insurance company.  Such reinsurance premiums are shown as  Tenant reinsurance premiums  in the above table.   

The subsidiary pays a fee to Public Storage to assist with the administration of the program and to allow the insurance to be markete  d to our tenants.  This   fee represents a substantial amount of the reinsurance premiums received by our subsidiary.  The fee is eliminated in consolidation and is therefore not shown in the above table.   

Tenant   reinsurance revenue increased from $28.2 million and $81.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, to $30.5 million and $89.0 million in the same periods in 2016, due to (i) increased average premiums per insured tenant resulting from higher average policy limits, (ii) a higher proportion of tenants having insurance  , and (iii) a larger number of potential insurance customers due to newly acquired   and developed   facilities in 2015 and 2016. 

We expect continued increases in tenant   re  insurance   p  remiu  ms   in the remainder of 2016 due to the same factors   noted above. 

Cost of   operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses.  Tenant reinsurance cost of operations increased from $6.6 million and $18.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, to $6.9 million and $23.4 million in the   same periods in 2016.  These increases are due primarily to an increase in exposure associated with more insured tenants and increased claims   experience  .    

Merchandise sales:     We sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities, and the level of sales of these items is primarily impacted by   the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities.  We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our merchandise sales in 2016. 

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities 

At September 30, 2016, we have equity investments in PSB, Shurgard Europe and various limited partnerships.  We account for such investments using the equity method and record our pro-rata share of the net income of these entities for each period.  The following table, and the discussion below, sets forth the significant components of our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities: 

Investment in PSB:     At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately a 42% common equity interest in PSB, comprised of our ownership of 7,158,354 shares of PSB s common stock     and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in an operating partnership controlled by PSB.  The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into PSB common stock.   

At September 30, 2016, PSB owned and operated 28.2 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in six states  .  PSB also manages commercial space that we own   pursuant to property management agreements.  

Equity in earnings from PSB decreased $  205,000     and $  416,000   in the three   and nine   months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   as compared to the same period  s   in 2015  .       These decreases are due to our $5.3 million and $10.3 million equity share of gains recorded by PSB in the three and nine months ended  

46   

September 30, 2015, respectively, offset by (i) our $1.5 million and $5.0 million equity share of improved property operations, (ii) our $1.3 million and $1.9 million equity share of reduced interest expense, and (iii) our $1.6 million and $2.7 million equity share of reduced income allocated to preferred shareholders, primarily due to redemption activity.    See Note 4 to   our September 30, 2016 financial statements for selected financial information on PSB, as well as PSB s filings and selected financial information that can be accessed through the SEC, and on PSB s website, www.psbusinessparks.com. 

Investment in Shurgard Europe:     We have a 49%   equity share in Shurgard Europe s net income.  At   September   30, 2016, Shurgard Europe s operations are compr  ised of 217 wholly-owned facilities with 12 million net rentable square feet.  See Note 4 to our September 30, 2016   financial statements for selected financial data on Shurgard Europe for the   nine months   ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015.  As described   in more detail in Note 4, we receive trademark license fees from Shurgard Europe.    

In   2015, Shurgard Europe acquired 21 facilities in the Netherlands (0.9 million net rentable square feet), for an aggregate of approximately $146 million ( 132 million), and issued  300.0 million of unsecured senior notes with maturities in 10, 12 and 15 years and an average interest rate of 2.7%.   

Our equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe increased $4.7 million and $5.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  The increases are due primarily to (i) improved same-store operating results and increased earnings from   newly acquired properties, (ii)   lower expenses associated with property acquisitions   and  ,    with respect to the three month period, (iii) a reduction in depreciation expense, and offset, with respect to the nine month period, by (iv  ) increased interest expense due to increased outstanding borrowings.  

For purposes of recording our equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe, the Euro was translated into U.S. Dollars based upon average   exchange rates of 1.116 for   each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.112 and 1.115 for the same periods in 2015  .    

Our future earnings from Shurgard Europe will be affected primarily by the operating results of its existing facilities, as well as the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and currencies in the countries in which Shurgard Europe conducts its business, principally the Euro, as well as the impact of income taxes.   

Unlike our operations in the United States, Shurgard Europe operates   through   taxable corporation  s   in each of the countries in which it does   business and incurs tax expense.  Our equity share of such income tax expense has   in  creased to approximately $  4.3   million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2015.  We expect   continued increases in tax expense incurred by Shurgard Europe in the remainder of 2016 and beyond, as its operations improve and its taxable income increases. 

Analysis of items not allocated to segments 

General and administrative expense:   The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense:  

47   

Share-based compensation expense includes the amortization of restricted share units and stock options granted to employees, as well as related employer taxes.  Share-based compensation expense varies based upon the level of grants and forfeitures as well as the Company s stock price on the date of grant.  The increases in share-based compensation costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 are due primarily to additional share-based grants and a higher average grant-date fair value per share.  We expect similar increases in share-based compensation in the remainder of 2016 as was experienced in the first nine months of 2016.  See Note 9 to our September 30, 2016 financial statements for further information on our share-based compensation.   

Costs of senior executives represent the cash compensation paid to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.   

Development and acquisition costs represent internal and external expenses related to our acquisition and development activities and varies primarily based upon the level of development and acquisition activities undertaken.  The amounts in the above table are net of $2.2 million and $6.5 million in development costs that were capitalized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $1.9 million and $5.8 million for the same periods in 201  5, to newly developed and redevelop  ed self-storage facilities.  Real estate development and acquisition costs are expected to increase modestly in the remainder of 2016. 

Tax compliance costs and taxes paid include taxes paid to various state and local authorities, the internal and external costs of filing tax returns, costs associated with complying with federal and state tax laws, and maintaining our compliance with   Internal Revenue Service REIT rules.  Such costs vary primarily based upon the tax rates of the various states in which we do business.   

Legal costs   include internal personnel as well as fees paid to legal firms and other third parties with respect to general   corporate legal matters and risk management, and varies based upon the level of litigation.  The decreases of $4.4 million and $9.5 million in legal costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to   the same periods in 2015 are due primarily to legal fees and expenses associated with certain litigated matters in the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015, including $3.5 million accrued in connection with the settlement of a legal matter.  The future level of legal costs is not determinable.   

Public company costs represent the incremental costs of operating as a publicly-traded company, such as internal and external investor relations expenses, stock listing and transfer agent fees, board of trustees  costs, and costs associated with maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   

Other costs represent professional and consulting fees, payroll and overhead that are not directly attributable to our property operations.  Such costs vary depending upon the level of corporate activities and initiatives and, as such, are not predictable. 

Our future general and administrative expenses are difficult to estimate, due to their dependence upon many factors, including those noted above. 

Interest and other income:    Interest and other income is comprised primarily of the net income from our commercial operations and property management operations and to a lesser extent interest earned on cash balances, trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe, as well as sundry other income items that are received from time to time in varying amounts.    Interest income on cash balances has been minimal, because rates have been at historic lows of 0.1% or less, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future.    We do not expect any significant changes in interest and other income in the remainder of 2016.   

Interest expense:    For the three and   nine months   ended   September   30,   2016, we incurred $2.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of interest on our outstanding debt, as compared to $  570,000   and $1.8 million for the same periods in 2015.  The increases in interest expense incurred are due to increased outstanding debt.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we capitalized interest of $1.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively, associated with our development activities, and $  570,000   and $1.8 million for the same periods in  

48   

2015.  These increases are due to increased development activities.  Future interest   expense will be dependent upon the level of outstanding debt and the amount of in-process development costs.   

Foreign Exchange   Gain (Loss):   We recorded   foreign currency translation losses of $3.7 million and $6.0 million for the three and     nine months   ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, representing the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Senior Unsecured Notes due to fluctuations in exchange rates.  The Euro was translated at exchange rates of   approximately 1.121 U.S.   Dollars per Euro at   September   30, 2016,   1.110 at June 30, 2016,   and 1.091 at December 31, 2015.  Future gains and losses on foreign currency translation will be de  pendent upon changes in the relative value of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar, and the level of Euro-denominated debt outstanding. 

Net Income Allocable to Preferred Shareholders:    Net income allocable to preferred shareholders based upon distributions decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015; due primarily to lower average outstanding preferred shares and lower average rates.  We also allocated $26.9 million of income from our common shareholders to the holders of our Preferred Shares in the nine months ended September 30, 2016   (none in the three months ended September 30, 2016), as compared to $4.1 million and $8.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, in connection with the redemption of our Preferred Shares.    Based upon our preferred shares outstanding at September 30, 2016, including the issuance of our Series E Preferred Shares on October 14, 2016, our quarterly distribution to our preferred   shareholders is expected to be approximately $59.5 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2016 and approximately $60.1 million thereafter. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Financial Strategy:    As a REIT, we generally distribute 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders, which relative to a taxable C corporation, limits the amount of cash flow from operations that we can retain for investments.  As a result, in order to grow our asset base, access to capital is important.  Historically we have primarily financed our cash investment activities with retained operating cash flow combined with the proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities.  Over the past twelve months, we began to diversify our capital sources by issuing medium term debt.   

Our financial profile is characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows.  We are one of the highest rated REITs, as rated by major rating agencies Moody s and Standard and Poor s.  Our senior debt has an  A  credit rating by Standard and Poor s and  A2  by Moody s.  Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are  A3  by Moody s and  BBB+  by Standard   Poor s.  Our credit profile and ratings enables us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital. 

We have a $500.0 million revolving line of credit which we occasionally use as temporary  bridge  financing until we are able to raise longer term capital.  As of September 30, 2016, there w  e no   borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit  , however, we do have approximately $15.2 million of outstanding letters of credit which limits our borrowing capacity to $484.8 million  .  Over the long-term, we expect to continue to fund our capital requirements with retained operating cash flow, the issuance of medium or long term debt, and proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred securities. 

Liquidity and Capital Resource Analysis:    We believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for   principal payments on debt, maintenance   capital   expenditures  , and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.   

As of September 30,   2016, our capital resources over the next year are e  xpected to be approximately $1.1   billion which exceeds our current planned capital needs over the next year of approximately $  594.0 million  .  Our capital resources include: (i) $57.2 million of cash as of September 30, 2016, (ii) $484.8 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (iii)   approximately $25  0.0 million of expected retained operating cash flow for the next twelve months, and (iv) $338.1 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our Series E  

49   

Preferred Shares on October 14, 2016.    Retained   operating cash flow represents our expected cash   flow provided by operating activities, less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain   our   facilities.   

Our planned capital needs over the next year consist of (i)   $426.8 million   of remaining spend on our current development pipeline, (  ii) $149.5 million in property   acquisitions currently under contract,   and (iii) $  17  .7 million   in principal repayments on existing debt.  Our capital needs may increase significantly over the next year as we expect to increase our development pipeline  ,   and acquire additional properties.  We may also redeem outstanding preferred securities   or repurchase shares of our common stock   in the future.   

To the extent our retained operating cash flow and line of credit are insufficient to fund our activities, w  e believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital     to fund such future commitments including issuing common or preferred securities, issuing debt, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities. 

Required   Debt   Repayments:     As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding debt totaled approximately $430.9     million, consisting of $47.5 million of secured debt and $383.4 million of unsecured debt.  Approximate principal maturities are as follows (amounts   in thousands): 

The remaining maturities on our debt over at least the next five years are nominal compared to our expected annual retained operating cash flow. 

Capital Expenditure Requirements:   Capital expenditures include   general maintenance,   major repairs or replacements to elements of our facilities   to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal  .     Capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or   redevelopment of existing   facilities   to increase their available square footage  .   

Capital expenditures totaled $67.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and are expected to be approximately $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For the last four years,   capital expenditures have ranged between   approximately $0.45 and $0.55 per   net   rentable square foot per year. 

Requirement to Pay Distributions:   For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Code.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.   

Distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1.1 billion, consisting of $  178  .7 million to preferred shareholders and $920.1 million to common shareholders and restricted share unitholders.  All of these distributions were REIT qualifying distributions. 

We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at September 30, 2016, including our Series     E   Preferred Shares that we issued on   October 14  , 2016, to be approximately $  240.5   million   per year.   

On   October 26, 2016  , our Board declared a regular common quarterly   dividend of   $2.00 per common share, which is an increase of $0.20 of 11% over the previous quarter s distribution.  Our consistent, long-term  

50   

dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.  Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash provided by operating activities.   

We estimate we will pay   approximately $8.0 million   per year in distributions to noncontrolling interests outstanding at September   30, 2016.   

Real Estate Investment Activities:     Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 21 self-storage facilities (eleven in Oklahoma, four each in Ohio and Tennessee, and one each in Texas and California), with 1.7 million net rentable square feet, for $1  49.5   million.    We will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant   competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire.   

As of September 30, 2016 we had development and   redevelopment   projects which will add approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $6  8  8.  2    million.  A total of $2  6  1.  4   million of these costs were incurred through September 30, 2016, with the remaining cost to complete of $426.8 million expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 months.  Some of these projects are subject to significant   contingencies such as entitlement approval.  We expect to continue to seek additional projects; however, the level of future development   and redevelopment   may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

Redemption of Preferred Securities  : Historically, we have taken advantage of refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we redeemed two series of preferred securities totaling $862.5 million which had a weighted average coupon of 6.42%.  During the same period, we issued $825.0 million of preferred securities which have a weighted average coupon of 5.156%.    In the future, we may elect to finance the redemption of preferred securities with proceeds from the issuance of debt.    We currently have no outstanding preferred securities that we can call for redemption until 2017, when four series of preferred securities become redeemable, at our option, with coupons ranging from 5.90% to 5.375% (see Note 7 to our September 30, 2016 financial statements).  Redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors including whether we can issue capital at a lower cost of capital than the shares that would be redeemed.  None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.   

Repurchases of Common Shares  : Our Board has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not repurchase any of our common shares.  From the inception of the repurchase program through November 2  , 2016,   we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million.    F  uture levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.   

Contractual Obligations  

Our significant contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending December 31 (amounts in thousands): 

51   

(1)    Amounts include principal and interest payments (all of which are fixed-rate) on our secured notes (the  Mortgage Notes ) based on their contractual terms.  See Note 5 to our September 30, 2016 financial statements for additional information on our notes payable.   

(2)    Reflects interest and principal on  342.0 million of Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes  .  See Note 5 to our September 30, 2016 financial statements for further information on our senior unsecured notes  . 

(3)    Represents future contractual payments on land, equipment and office space under various operating leases.   

(4)    Represen  ts future expected development spending that was under contract at September 30, 2016. 

We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at September 30, 2016, including our Series E Preferred Shares that we issued on October 14, 2016, to be   approximately $  240.5   million   per year.  Dividends are paid when and if declared by our Board and accumulate if not paid.   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  : At September 30, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under Regulation S-K 303(a)(4) and the instructions thereto. 

ITEM   3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

To limit our exposure to market risk, we are capitalized primarily with preferred and common equity.  Our preferred shares are redeemable at our option generally five years after issuance, but the holder has no redemption   option.  Our debt is our only market-risk sensitive portion of our capital structure, which   totals $  4  30.9     million   and represents   4.8  % of the book value of our equity at   September   30  , 2016.  

We have foreign currency exposure at   September   30  , 2016 related to i) our investment in Shurgard Europe, with a book   value of $  28  3  .  3   million and   ii)    3  42  .0   million   ($  383.4   million) of Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes payable.   

The fair value of our fixed rate debt at   September   30  , 2016   is approximately $45  4  .  0   million  .  The table below summarizes the annual maturities of our fixed rate debt, which had a weighted average fixed rate of 2.  2  % at   September   30  , 2016.  See Note 5 to our   September   30  , 2016 financial statements   for further information regarding our fixed rate debt (amounts in thousands).

I  TEM     4  .        Controls and Procedures 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in accordance with SEC guidelines and that such information is communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures in reaching that level of reasonable assurance.  We also have investments in certain unconsolidated real estate entities and because we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level.   

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September   30  , 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

53   

Part II.  

OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1  .  

Legal Proceedings  

We are a party to various   legal proceedings and subject to various claims and complaints  ; however,     we   believe that the likelihood of these contingencies resulting in a material loss to the Company, either individually or in the aggregate, is remote. 

ITEM 1A  .  

Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2015, in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our other filings with the SEC.  These factors may materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations.  In addition, in   considering   the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q and elsewhere, you should refer to the qualifications and limitations on our forward-looking statements that are described in Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 2.  

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

Common Share Repurchases 

Our Board has authorized   management to repurchase   up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  From the inception of the repurchase program through   November 2  , 201  6  , we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares (all purchased prior to 2010) at an aggregate cost   of approximately $679.1 million.  Our common share repurchase program does not have an expiration date   and   there are   11,278,084 common shares   that may yet be repurchased unde  r our repurchase program as of   September   30  , 2016  .  We have no current plans to repurchase shares; however, f  uture levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives, and the trading price of our common shares.   

Preferred Share Redemptions 

We redeemed, pursuant to our option to redeem such shares,   1  9  ,  5  00,000 of our Series   R   preferred shares in   July   2016 at $25.00 per share.  No other redemptions we  re   made in the   thir  d quarter of 2016  .
