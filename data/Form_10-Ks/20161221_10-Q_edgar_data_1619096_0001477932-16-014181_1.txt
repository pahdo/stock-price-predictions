Notes to Financial Statements       NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      Summit Networks Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China.      The Company activities to date have been limited to capital formation, organization, development of its business plan and minimal sales. The Company has commenced limited operations.      NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       a.  Basis of Presentation       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ).         The Company has a July 31, year-end.       b.  Reclassification       Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net income or losses.      c.  Earnings per Share       ASC No. 260,  Earnings Per Share , specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC No. 260.      Basic net loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.       d.  Cash and Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.            SUMMIT NETWORKS INC.    Notes to Financial Statements              NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)         e.  Use of Estimates and Assumptions       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       f.  Income Taxes       Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.     Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.      g.    Revenue Recognition       The Company records revenue on the accrual basis when all goods and services have been performed and delivered, the amounts are readily determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. The Company has generated $208,341 in revenue since its inception.      h.  Advertising       The Company expenses its advertising when incurred. There has been $12,498 in advertising expense since inception.      i.  Fixed Assets       Fixed assets are stated at cost. The Company utilizes straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful life of the asset.     Property   40 years   Office Equipment   7 years             SUMMIT NETWORKS INC.    Notes to Financial Statements         NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)       j.  New Accounting Pronouncements       The Company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and believe that none of them will have a material effect on the company s financial statements.      NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern basis. The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception) to October 31, 2016 resulting in net loss of $29,781. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Even though the Company is currently in the development stage and has minimal expenses, management does not believe that the company s current cash of $213 is sufficient to cover the expenses they will incur during the next twelve months.       NOTE 4. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS      There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common.      NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      The sole officer and director of the Company may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities as they become available, he may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and his other business opportunities. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.     As of October 31, 2016, an amount due to Mr. Andris Berzins, CEO of the Company, was $458 which is non-interest bearing with no specific repayment terms.       NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES                    SUMMIT NETWORKS INC.    Notes to Financial Statements         NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES (Continued)      The Company had an income tax benefit of $1,478 for the year ended July 31, 2015. As of October 31, 2016, the Company reserved the deferred tax asset of $1,478.      NOTE 7.   STOCKHOLDERS    EQUITY      Transactions, other than employees  stock issuance, are in accordance with ASC No. 505. Thus issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received. Transactions with employees  stock issuance are in accordance with ASC No. 718. These issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or whichever is more readily determinable.      As of October 31, 2016 the stockholders  equity section of the Company contains Common stock, $0.001 par value: 75,000,000 shares authorized; 5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding.     On July 23, 2014 the Company issued a total of 4,000,000 shares of common stock to a director for cash in the amount of $0.001 per share for a total of $4,000.     On January 29, 2015 the Company issued a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock to 30 independent investors for cash in the amount of $0.04 per share for a total of $40,000.      As of October 31, 2016, the Company had 5,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.      NOTE 8. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT      The Company currently has property consisting of an office and shop for $8,000 and office equipment for $9,750. Depreciation expense was $399 for the three months ended October 31, 2016.      NOTE   9.   COMMITMENT   CONTINGENCIES      On July 30, 2014, the Company entered into Commercial Lease Agreement for three years that expires July 30, 2017 for $1,000 a month as the Company s office space. The rent expense for the years ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $0 due to a  free rent promotion offered by the property manager based upon the Company committing to signing a new lease beginning in August 2018 which hasn't yet been signed or agreed upon yet. Future lease commitments are as follows:                     ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.          CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS       The information contained in this report, including in the documents incorporated by reference into this report, includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are  forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our Company and management s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future, including our financial condition, results of operations, and financial performance. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words  anticipates,   believes,   continue,   could,   estimates,   expects,   intends,   may,   might,   plans,   possible,   potential,   predicts,   projects,   seeks,   should,   will,   would  and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.     The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and the potential effects on the parties and the transaction. There can be no assurance that future developments actually affecting us will be those anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the parties  control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.       Results of Operations       We have generated $208,341 in revenues since our inception on July 8, 2014. Our cost of goods sold was $153,261 resulting in a gross profit of $55,079. During the period from inception to October 31, 2016, our operating expenses were comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses of $84,861, resulting in a net loss of $29,781. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of mainly professional fees.     During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated $12,623 and $20,974, respectively, in revenues with cost of goods sold being $11,269 and $8,363, resulting in gross profits of $1,354 and $12,611. Our operating expenses for the same three month periods were comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses of $3,877 and $19,220, respectively, resulting in net losses of $2,522 and $6,609. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the period consisted of mainly professional fees.     Our total assets at October 31, 2016 were $15,177, which was $213 in cash, $1,000 in other assets and $13,964 in property and office equipment. We currently anticipate that our legal and accounting fees over the next 12 months as a result of being a reporting company with the SEC, and will be approximately $9,000.            We received the initial equity funding of $4,000 from our sole officer and director who purchased 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share.      On January 29, 2015 the Company issued a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock to 30 independent investors for cash in the amount of $0.04 per share for a total of $40,000.      As of October 31, 2016 the Company had 5,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.        As of October 31, 2016, there is a total of $458 in a note payable that is owed by the company to an officer and director for expenses that he has paid on behalf of the company. The note payable is interest free and payable on demand.       Plan of Operation for the next 12 months       We closed our Offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1. The Offering was for the sale of a total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $.04 per share. We were only able to sell 50% of the offering, 1,000,000 shares for proceeds of $40,000. Proceeds from the sale of the shares were used to fund the initial stages of our business development. Because we were not able to raise sufficient capital to execute our full business plan, we are now engaged in discussions with third parties regarding alternative directions for the Company that could enhance shareholder value. The business plan of our company below assumes that we will continue with our business as originally planned. However, as mentioned above, we are in discussions that could lead to another direction for the Company.     The following table sets forth the use of proceeds based on the sale of 50% of the securities offered for sale by the Company.         __________  (1) Expenditures for the next 12 months. The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.            The figures above represent only estimated costs and may be adjusted based upon revenues.     We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute glass craft products, in forms including but not limited to glass crafts, novelties, knobs, trophies, vases, glasses, boxes, bowls, trays, plates. We currently have some operating history which includes revenues and cost of sales. Our plan of operations over the next 12 month period is as follows:      Set up Office.    Time Frame: 1 st  to 3 rd  months      Now that our Offering has closed we plan to acquire the necessary office equipment to expand operations. We have budgeted a cost of $2,000 to obtain the necessary office equipment. Andris Berzins, our sole officer and director will handle our administrative duties.      Develop Our Website.    Time Frame: 3 rd  to 5 th  months      When our equipment is obtained, we intend to begin developing our website. Our sole officer and director, Andris Berzins will be in charge of registering our web domain. Once we register our web domain, we plan to hire a web designer to help us design and develop our website. We do not have any written agreements with any web designers at current time. We have budgeted a cost of $3,500 for the website. It will take up to 90 days to develop our website. There will be information about us, the variety of glass craft products we will offer, information on how to order our product and other information. Updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations.      Commence Marketing Campaign.    Time Frame: 6 th  to 12 th  months      Once our website is operational, we will begin to market our product. We intend to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We also expect to get new clients from  word of mouth  advertising where our new clients will refer their friend and colleagues to us. We plan to attend trade shows in our industry to showcase our product with a view to find new customers. We also will use internet promotion tools on Facebook and Twitter to advertise our products and company. We intend to spend $15,000 on marketing efforts during the first year. Marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations.            Negotiate service agreements with potential wholesale customers.    Time Frame: 6 th  to 12 th  months      At the same time we start our marketing campaign, we plan to contact and start negotiations with potential wholesale customers, such as glass craft distributors. Initially, our sole officer and director, Mr. Berzins, will look for potential wholesale customers. We will negotiate terms and conditions of collaboration. Even though the negotiation with potential wholesale customers will be ongoing during the life of our operations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish successful agreements.     Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of service agreements at the end of the twelve month period, there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition.     Based on our current operating plan, we believe that we will increase our revenue from selling our glass craft products by mid-2017. We may need to obtain additional financing to operate our business for the next twelve months. Additional financing, whether through public or private equity or debt financing, arrangements with the security holder or other sources to fund operations, may not be available, or if available, may be on terms unacceptable to us.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       At October 31, 2016 we had $213 in cash and there were outstanding liabilities of $958. Our director has verbally agreed to continue to loan the company funds for operating expenses in a limited scenario, but he has no legal obligation to do so.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       Management maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
