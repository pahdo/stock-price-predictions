CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

Certain
statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are considered forward-looking statements
(within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning our business, results of operations, economic
performance and/or financial condition, based on management s current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and projections.
Forward-looking statements are included, for example, in the discussions about:  

strategy;   

new
    product discovery and development;   

current
    or pending clinical trials;   

our
    products  ability to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile;   

actions
    by the FDA and other regulatory authorities;   

product
    manufacturing, including our arrangements with third-party suppliers;   

product
    introduction and sales;   

royalties
    and contract revenues;   

expenses
    and net income;   

credit
    and foreign exchange risk management;   

liquidity;   

asset
    and liability risk management;   

the
    outcome of litigation and other proceedings;   

intellectual
    property rights and protection;   

economic
    factors;   

competition;
    and   

legal
    risks.   

Any
statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements generally are identified by the words  expects,   anticipates,   believes,   intends, 
 estimates,   aims,   plans,   may,   could,   will, 
 will continue,   seeks,   should,   predict,   potential,   outlook, 
 guidance,   target,   forecast,   probable,   possible  or the negative
of such terms and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to change and may be affected by risks and uncertainties,
most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events,
except as required by law, although we intend to continue to meet our ongoing disclosure obligations under the U.S. securities
laws and other applicable laws.  

We
caution you that a number of important factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed
in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place too much reliance on them. These factors
include, among others, those described herein, under  Risk Factors  and elsewhere in this Annual Report and in our
other public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors,
and therefore the factors that are noted are not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties
that may affect forward-looking statements. If these or other risks and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying
any of the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, our actual performance and future actions may be materially different from
those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. We can offer no assurance that our estimates or expectations
will prove accurate or that we will be able to achieve our strategic and operational goals.  

Any
statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements generally are identified by the words  expects,   anticipates,   believes,   intends, 
 estimates,   aims,   plans,   may,   could,   will, 
 will continue,   seeks,   should,   predict,   potential,   outlook, 
 guidance,   target,   forecast,   probable,   possible  or the negative
of such terms and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to change and may be affected by risks and uncertainties,
most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events,
except as required by law, although we intend to continue to meet our ongoing disclosure obligations under the U.S. securities
laws and other applicable laws.  

Forward-looking
statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or management s good faith belief as of that
time with respect to future events, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance
or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that
could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:  

our
    lack of operating history;   

our
    current and future capital requirements and our ability to satisfy our capital needs;   

our
    inability to keep up with industry competition;   

interpretations
    of current laws and the passages of future laws;   

acceptance
    of our business model by investors and our ability to raise capital;   

our
    drug discovery and development activities may not result in products that are approved by the applicable regulatory authorities.
    Even if our drug candidates do obtain regulatory approval they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success;   

our
    reliance on key personnel, including our ability to attract and retain scientists;   

our
    reliance on third party manufacturing, some of which is outside the United States and may therefore be subject to political,
    economic and other uncertainties, to supply drugs for clinical trials and sales;   

our
    limited distribution organization with no sales and marketing staff;   

our
    being subject to product liability claims;   

our
    reliance on key personnel, including our ability to attract and retain scientists;   

legislation
    or regulation that may increase the cost of our business or limit our service and product offerings;   

risks
    related to our intellectual property, including our ability to adequately protect intellectual property rights;   

risks
    related to government regulation, including our ability to obtain approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our
    drug candidates, and ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review which may result in significant additional
    expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and   

our
    ability to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions to allow us to market our products internationally.   

Moreover,
new risks regularly emerge and it is not possible for our management to predict or articulate all risks we face, nor can we assess
the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to
differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this prospectus are
based on information available to us on the date of this Annual Report. Except to the extent required by applicable laws or rules,
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on
our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained above and throughout this Annual Report.  

JUMPSTART
OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT   

We
qualify as an  emerging growth company  as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act ( JOBS
Act ) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31,
2015, the last day of our last fiscal year. We are electing to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised
accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.  

As
an emerging growth company, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are
otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:  

being
    permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related  Management s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this annual report;   

not
    being requested to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended
    ( Sarbanes-Oxley Act );   

reduced
    disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements;
    and   

exemptions
    from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden
    parachute payments not previously approved.   

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) our reporting $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues;
(ii) the end of fiscal year 2019; (iii) our issuance, in a three year period, of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt;
and (iv) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million
on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter

Organization and Description of Business   

Immune
Therapeutics, Inc. (the  Company ) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International,
Inc. ( Resort Clubs ). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the
United States. Galliano International Ltd. ( Galliano ) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading
in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the
surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. ( pH Environmental ).  

On
April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange
agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our
shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune
Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our
name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.  

The
Company currently operates out of Orlando, Florida. In July 2012, the Company s focus turned to acquiring patents that would
protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies, such as low dose naltrexone ( LDN )
and Methionine [Met5]-enkephalin ( MENK ). Today, the Company is focused on the development and commercialization
of therapeutic treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and opportunistic infections arising from their treatment, and commercializing
affordable, non-toxic therapies in Africa, to be followed by Asia and South America, and autoimmune diseases and immune disorders
by combating these severe and fatal diseases through the stimulation and/or regulation of the body s immune system. The
Company s therapies are believed to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in such a way that they provide the potential
to treat a variety of diseases. We believe our therapies may be able to correct abnormalities or deficiencies in the immune system
in diseases such as HIV infection, autoimmune disease, immune disorders, or cancer; all of which can lead to disease progression
and life-threatening situations when the immune system is not functioning optimally.  

In
October 2012, the Company formed TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a BVI company in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, which was
set up to allow the Company to market and sell LDN in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have been able to obtain approval
to sell the Company s products.  

In
August 2013, the Company formed its United Kingdom subsidiary, TNI BioTech, LTD (the  UK Subsidiary ). The UK Subsidiary
received approval to be considered a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise ( SME ) with the European Medicines Agency
( EMA ) on August 21, 2013. The designation provides the UK Subsidiary with significant discounts when holding meetings
or submitting filings to the EMA. On September 19, 2013, the UK Subsidiary submitted a pre-submission package to the EMA regarding
Crohn s Disease. The EMA granted the UK Subsidiary a meeting that took place on September 27, 2013. The UK Subsidiary is
eligible to benefit from the provisions for administrative and financial assistance for SMEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 2049/2005.
The Company will apply to obtain EMA benefits once funding becomes available.  

In
December 2013, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Cytocom Inc. ( Cytocom ). Cytocom is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical
company focused on the development of the first affordable non-toxic immunodulator for the treatment of inflammatory diseases,
immune-related disorders, and cancer, and is responsible for the development of the Company s patented therapies under the
auspices of the FDA and EMA. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom to its shareholders.
As part of the transaction, the Company retained exclusive rights to all international patents, in-country approvals, formulations,
trademarks, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distributions rights in emerging nations, including Africa, Central America,
South America, Russia, India, China, Far East, and The Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union). The Company will
continue to have access to existing clinical data as well as any new data generated by Cytocom during drug development. On December
8, 2014, the number of Cytocom shares of common stock that were issued to our shareholders totaled 113,242,522 shares. In connection
with the transaction, Cytocom issued 140,100,000 shares of its common stock to the Company, which gave the Company a 55.3% equity
interest in Cytocom on that date. In April 2016, the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Cytocom approved a reverse
stock split of Cytocom s outstanding common stock with one new share of stock for each twenty old shares of common stock.
Cytocom effectuated and finalized the reverse split in June 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company s equity interest had
been further reduced to 17%, by subsequent issuances of Cytocom common stock to shareholders in settlement of notes payable.  

In
March 2014, the Company incorporated Airmed Biopharma Limited, an Irish corporation with an address in Dublin, Ireland, and Airmed
Holdings Limited, an Irish company domiciled in Bermuda. The Irish companies were set up to benefit from incentives granted by
the Irish government for the establishment of pharmaceutical companies (many of the world s leading pharmaceutical companies
have located in Ireland), and so that the Company could take advantage of Ireland s status as a member of the European Union
and the European Economic Area. An Irish limited liability company enjoys a low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%, one of the
lowest in the world. The Irish-domiciled company hopes to qualify for tax incentives for Irish holding/headquartered companies
and to benefit from the network of double tax treaties that reduce withholding taxes. TNI BioTech International, Ltd. will manage
our international distribution, using product that is manufactured in Ireland and elsewhere.  

Immune
Therapeutics is commercializing affordable non-toxic immunotherapies focused on the activation and rebalancing of the body s
immune system. Stimulating the body s immune system remains one of the most promising approaches in the treatment of cancers,
HIV, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions and other opportunistic infections, and for treating chronic, often life-threatening,
diseases in Emerging Nations through the mobilization of the body s immune system using existing clinical data.  

As
of this date, neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States until
we receive approval of a New Drug Application from the FDA. Neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application
for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and
uncertain process.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company has incurred significant net losses since inception and has relied on its ability to fund its operations through private
equity financings. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue at more significant levels in the future.
As the Company continues to incur losses, transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval,
and commercialization of its product candidate and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support the Company s
cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to
raise additional cash. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public debt or equity offerings,
and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. Based on the Company s
operating plan, existing working capital at December 31, 2015 was not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned
operations through December 31, 2016 without additional sources of cash. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis
of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business.  

The
Company experienced a net loss from operations of $(14,627,993) and used cash and cash equivalents from operations in the amount
of $2,333,377 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in stockholders deficit of $(7,464,769) at September
30, 2016.  

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. However, in the opinion
of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise indicated) necessary to present
fairly the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been made. The results for interim periods
are not necessarily indicative of trends or of results to be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 (including the notes thereto)
set forth in Form 10-K/A.  

The
Company qualifies as an  emerging growth company  as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups
Act ( JOBS Act ) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue for the year ended December 31,
2015. We are electing to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from such estimates.  

Cash,
Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term Investments   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include bank demand deposits, marketable securities with maturities of three months
or less at purchase, and money market funds that invest primarily in certificates of deposits, commercial paper and U.S. government
and U.S. government agency obligations. Cash equivalents are reported at fair value.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents. The
Company is exposed to credit risk, subject to federal deposit insurance, in the event of a default by the financial institutions
holding its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of amounts recorded on the balance sheets. The cash accounts are insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. At September 30, 2016, the Company has no uninsured cash balances.  

Segment
and Geographic Information   

Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the
chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment and does not segment the business for internal
reporting or decision making.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

In
accordance with the reporting requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)
Topic 825,   Financial Instruments  , the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which
qualify as financial instruments under this standard and includes this additional information in the notes to the financial statements
when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accounts payable are accounted for at cost which approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments.
The carrying value of notes payable also approximates fair value since they bear market rates of interest and other terms. None
of these instruments are held for trading purposes.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements,  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. In general,
fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not
available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters.
Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include
amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the customer s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable
parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from three to five years. Maintenance and repairs are charged against
expense as incurred. Depreciation expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $299 and $638,
respectively.  

Intangible
Assets   

Costs
incurred to acquire and/or develop the Company s product licenses and patents are capitalized and amortized by straight-line
methods over estimated useful lives of seven to sixteen years. Intangible assets are stated at the lower of cost or estimated
fair market value. At the end of 2015, the Company determined that the unamortized carrying amount recorded for the acquisition
of licenses and patents related to LDN were impaired, and recorded an impairment loss of $5,226,352. In 2014, the Company determined
that the carrying amount recoded for the acquisition of licenses and patents related to MENK were impaired, and recorded an impairment
loss of $9,908,477.  

During
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company did not capitalize any costs to acquire and/or develop
the Company s product licenses and patents. (See Note 10). Amortization expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015 was $0 and $444,175, respectively.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

The
Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed by ASC Topic 360-10-05,   Property, Plant and Equipment .  If
the carrying amount of the asset, including any intangible assets associated with that asset, exceeds its estimated undiscounted
net cash flow, before interest, the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying amount
and its estimated fair value. No impairment losses were recognized for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and are typically comprised of salaries and benefits, pre-clinical studies,
clinical trial activities, drug development and manufacturing, fees paid to consultants and other entities that conduct certain
research and development activities on the Company s behalf and third-party service fees, including clinical research organizations
and investigative sites. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials are recognized based on an evaluation
of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information
provided by vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements,
which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as operating expenses.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company follows FASB ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes,   which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the asset will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  

The
standard addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded
in the financial statements. Under ASC Topic 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC Topic
740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods
and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption, and as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company does
not have a liability for unrecognized tax uncertainties.  

The
Company s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. At the end of the
quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company had not accrued any interest or penalties related to uncertain
tax positions.  

Stock-Based
Compensation and Issuance of Stock for Non-Cash Consideration   

The
Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including
employee stock options, based on estimated fair values equaling either the market value of the shares issued or the value of consideration
received, whichever is more readily determinable. The majority of the non-cash consideration pertains to services rendered by
consultants and others and has been valued at the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of the agreement.  

The
Company s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services
follows the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50,   Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees .  The measurement date
for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance
by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete.  

Non-controlling
Interest   

In
accordance with ASC 810,  Consolidation , the Company consolidates Cytocom, Inc. The non-controlling interests in Cytocom
represent the interests of outside shareholders in the equity and results of operations of Cytocom.  

Net
Loss per Share   

Basic
net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated
by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using
the treasury-stock method and the if-converted method. Dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of common stock purchase
warrants and options outstanding. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate
basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company s net loss position.  

A
calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share follows:  

The
Company s potential dilutive securities which include stock, stock warrants and convertible debt have been excluded from
the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average
Common stock outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same.  

The
following shares of potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted average shares
outstanding as the effect of including such securities would be antidilutive:  

Recent
Accounting Standards   

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the
adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.  

The
Company qualifies as an  emerging growth company  as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups
Act ( JOBS Act ) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as
of December 31, 2015, our last fiscal year. We are electing to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised
accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.

Capital Structure Common Stock and Common Stock Purchase Warrants   

Each
holder of common stock is entitled to vote on all matters and is entitled to one vote for each share held. No holder of shares
of stock of any class shall be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase or receive any part of any new or additional

Shares
Issued for Services   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 29,283,910 and 16,922,504 shares of common stock respectively
for consulting fees. The Company valued these shares at $5,420,760 and $1,029,375 respectively, based upon the fair value of the
common stock at the dates of the agreements. The consulting fees are amortized over the contract periods, which are typically
between 12 and 24 months. The amortization of prepaid services totaled $2,315,190 and $3,895,018 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company also issued and expensed $2,088,759 of stock for services.  

8.
Income Taxes  -  Results of Operations   

There
was no income tax expense reflected in the results of operations for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because the
Company incurred a net loss in both quarters.  

The
Company has recognized no tax benefit for the losses generated for the periods through December 31, 2015. ASC Topic 740 requires
that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not
be realized. The Company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future
taxable income. Because the Company has yet to recognize revenue, we believe that the full valuation allowance should be provided.  

The
Company s effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2013 was 0%. The Company s tax rate can be affected by recurring
items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions. It may also be affected
by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the Company has estimated federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL ) carry-forwards
of approximately $66,500,000, which will expire in 2032-2035.

Distribution
of Lodonal TM  in Nigeria   

Through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, TNI BioTech International, Ltd., in December 2015 the Company completed a 90-day bridging trial for
the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. The trial consisted of a total of 150 patients of both genders between the ages of 18-60,
each of whom was infected HIV/AIDS. The primary objective of this bridging trial was to confirm that Lodonal TM  has
a beneficial effect on the immune system of immune deficient patients and that it is safe. The trial separated patients into a
Control (placebo) Group and a Treatment Group (which was administered Lodonal TM ). The efficacy of increasing CD4 count
[cell/mm3] between Day-1 and Day-90 by at least 25% was set as the criteria for demonstrating beneficial effect on the immune
system. Safety was demonstrated through quality of life assessment and vitals both of which were not adversely affected. Treatment
Group patients were given a daily dose of 4.5-mg/kg of Lodonal.  

In
April 2016, the Company announced that Nigeria s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control ( NAFDAC )
had approved its Lodonal TM  as an over the counter, non-toxic adjunct therapy in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and immune
system regulator. NAFDAC is the Nigerian agency under the Federal Ministry of Health that is responsible for regulating and controlling
the manufacture, import/export, distribution, sale and use of food and drugs. The NAFDAC approval clears the way for the Company
and its distribution partners to complete the registration of Lodonal TM  for sale in Nigeria. The Company is currently
completing the registration process to allow it to import the drug into Nigeria.  

Other
Distribution Agreements

CPMS for all unused packaging materials for the LDN, which unused packaging materials CPMS will provide to IMUN. If CPMS does
not receive and ship at least 1,000 orders (prescriptions) during the term of the agreement, the Company will be required to reimburse
CPMS for 100% of the  ramp up costs  (defined as all costs and expenses of labor and materials related to the testing,
and required FDA and other governmental documentation/approvals of test data) of providing and producing the LDN, even where the
Company cancels/terminates the agreement, which provision shall survive the cancellation/termination of the agreement.  

On October 25, 2016, the Company and Acromax
Dominicana, SA ( Acromax ) entered into a contract for manufacturing of LDN tablets, capsules and/or creams ( Agreement ).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Acromax will obtain all necessary licenses and permits to carry out the
manufacturing and packaging of LDN in exchange for a fixed fee per tablet plus an additional fee for packaging, shipping and customs
clearance. The Agreement has an initial term of five years unless terminated by either party in accordance with the terms.

Subsequent Events   

In
October 2016, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, TNI BioTech International, Ltd., and GB Pharma Holdings, LLC ( GBPH ),
entered into an exclusive agency agreement ( Agency Agreement ) that replaced the agency agreement originally entered
into in June 2014 between GBPH and Airmed Biopharma Limited. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agency Agreement, the
Company appointed GBPH as its exclusive agent to (i) assist the Company in obtaining governmental approvals for the sale of LDN
and MENK ( Products ) in countries specified in the agreement, (ii) facilitate the registration of the Products in
those countries, (iii) identify and present to the Company distributors for the Products in those countries, and (iv) subject
to GBPH meeting certain requirements, enter into distribution agreements with the specified organizations to distribute the Products

Agency Agreement has an initial term of five years, and will automatically renew for additional one year terms unless terminated
by either party in accordance with its terms. If the Company sells or disposes of all or substantially all of its assets, whether
by purchase, merger or otherwise, the Company shall have the right to terminate the Agency Agreement immediately, whereupon the
Company will be obligated to pay Agent a royalty in perpetuity in an amount equal to one percent of funds actually received by
the Company from the sale of the Products in the specified countries, after the deduction of certain costs of sale.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION   

Forward-Looking
Statements and Associated Risks    

This
section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations
of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current
fact. Forward-looking statements also can be identified by words such as  future,   anticipates,   believes, 
 estimates,   expects,   intends,   will,   would,   could, 
 can,   may,  and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
the Company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors
that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the
year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2016 (the  2015 Form 10-K/A )
under the heading  Risk Factors .   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2015 Form 10-K/A and the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. All information presented herein is based on the Company s fiscal calendar.
Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company s
fiscal years ended in December and the associated quarters, months, or periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the  Company ,
 we ,  us  or  our  as used herein refers collectively to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for
any reason, except as required by law.   

General   

Immune
Therapeutics, Inc. (the  Company ) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International,
Inc. ( Resort Clubs ). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the
United States. Galliano International Ltd. ( Galliano ) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading
in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the
surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. ( pH Environmental ).  

On
April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange
agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our
shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune
Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our
name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.  

The
Company currently operates out of Orlando, Florida. In July 2012, the Company s focus turned to acquiring patents that would
protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies, such as low dose naltrexone ( LDN )
and Methionine [Met5]-enkephalin ( MENK ). Today, the Company is focused on the development and commercialization
of therapeutic treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and opportunistic infections arising from their treatment, and commercializing
affordable, non-toxic therapies in Africa, to be followed by Asia and South America, and autoimmune diseases and immune disorders
by combating these severe and fatal diseases through the stimulation and/or regulation of the body s immune system. The
Company s therapies are believed to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in such a way that they provide the potential
to treat a variety of diseases. We believe our therapies may be able to correct abnormalities or deficiencies in the immune system
in diseases such as HIV infection, autoimmune disease, immune disorders, or cancer; all of which can lead to disease progression
and life-threatening situations when the immune system is not functioning optimally.  

In
October 2012, the Company formed TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a BVI company in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, which was
set up to allow the Company to market and sell LDN in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have been able to obtain approval
to sell the Company s products.  

In
August 2013, the Company formed its United Kingdom subsidiary, TNI BioTech, LTD (the  UK Subsidiary ). The UK Subsidiary
received approval to be considered a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise ( SME ) with the European Medicines Agency
( EMA ) on August 21, 2013. The designation provides the UK Subsidiary with significant discounts when holding meetings
or submitting filings to the EMA. On September 19, 2013, the UK Subsidiary submitted a pre-submission package to the EMA regarding
Crohn s Disease. The EMA granted the UK Subsidiary a meeting that took place on September 27, 2013. The UK Subsidiary is
eligible to benefit from the provisions for administrative and financial assistance for SMEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 2049/2005.
The Company will apply to obtain EMA benefits once funding becomes available.  

In
December 2013, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Cytocom Inc. ( Cytocom ). Cytocom is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical
company focused on the development of the first affordable non-toxic immunodulator for the treatment of inflammatory diseases,
immune-related disorders, and cancer, and is responsible for the development of the Company s patented therapies under the
auspices of the FDA and EMA. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom to its shareholders.
As part of the transaction, the Company retained exclusive rights to all international patents, in-country approvals, formulations,
trademarks, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distributions rights in emerging nations, including Africa, Central America,
South America, Russia, India, China, Far East, and The Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union). The Company will
continue to have access to existing clinical data as well as any new data generated by Cytocom during drug development. On December
8, 2014, the number of Cytocom shares of common stock that were issued to our shareholders totaled 113,242,522 shares. In connection
with the transaction, Cytocom issued 140,100,000 shares of its common stock to the Company, which gave the Company a 55.3% equity
interest in Cytocom on that date. In April 2016, the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Cytocom approved a reverse
stock split of Cytocom s outstanding common stock with one new share of stock for each twenty old shares of common stock.
Cytocom effectuated and finalized the reverse split in June 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company s equity interest had
been further reduced to 17%, by subsequent issuances of Cytocom common stock to shareholders in settlement of notes payable.  

In
March 2014, the Company incorporated Airmed Biopharma Limited, an Irish corporation with an address in Dublin, Ireland, and Airmed
Holdings Limited, an Irish company domiciled in Bermuda. The Irish companies were set up to benefit from incentives granted by

percentages or where otherwise indicated)    

Revenues   

We
had revenues from operations of $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to revenues of $4,958 for three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues was the result of the Company s termination of its manufacturing agreement
with KRS Global Bio Technology, Inc. ( KRS ), which was cancelled by mutual agreement of the parties in May 2016.
Shipments under the agreement with Complete Pharmacy and Medical Solutions, LLC, which will replace KRS as the Company s
manufacturer and distributor of LDN tablets, have not yet commenced.

In
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total cash and accruals for selling, general and administrative expense was $1,031
compared to $865 for the corresponding period in 2015, an increase of $166 or 19%. Significant cash items included:  

Research
and development   

R D
expenses and related percentages for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):  

Expenses
for research and development in the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 122% compared to the same period in 2015.
The increase occurred mainly as a result of (i) the commencement of new trials in Malawi and Senegal ($124), which were offset
by a $24 decrease in the cost trials in Nigeria, and (ii) an increase of $36 in legal fees paid to maintain patents and licenses.  

In
the three months ended September 30, 2016, significant items included:  

All
of the R D spending in 2016 was on LDN. In 2015, 75% of R D spending was on the development of LDN; the balance was spent
on MENK.  

Stock
issued for services   

The
Company periodically issues stock to consultants who provide services to the Company under consulting contracts. The Company records
an expense for the cost of these services, calculated by the number of shares issued for the services multiplied by the price
of the Company s stock on the effective date of the consulting contract. If the period over which services are to be provided
extends beyond the date of the Company s financial report, the portion of the cost applicable to the future services is
accrued as a liability, which is then amortized over the period in which the services are provided to the Company. The Company
reports these costs separately from Selling, general and administrative costs, and Research and development costs, to better demonstrate
the true costs of Selling, general and administrative activities, and Research and development.  

Cost
of stock issued for services G A and related percentages for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows
(dollar amounts in thousands):  

The
decrease reflects the decrease in amount of stock that was issued for services.  

The
number of shares issued for prepaid consulting services G A in the three months ending September 30, 2016 was 5,790,910 (6,683,334
in the corresponding period in 2015).  

Amortization
of prepaid consulting services G A in the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the following:  

There
was no expense for amortization of stock issued for services R D for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, due
to the fact that the cost of shares issued for R D services had been fully amortized prior to the third quarter of 2014.  

There
were no new shares issued for prepaid consulting services R D in the three months ending September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Warrant
valuation expense   

When
the Company sells its stock to stockholders for cash, it periodically issues warrants to those stockholders to acquire additional
stock at prices agreed at the date of the original sale. The Company incurs a cost for the rights attached to the warrants, which
is calculated using the Black-Scholes Model (see above 4. Capital Structure Common Stock and Common Stock Purchase Warrants.)
This expense is reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations above as the Warrant valuation expense.  

In
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,000,000 warrants. In the three months ended September 30, 2015,
the Company issued 390,000 warrants to stockholders.  

Depreciation
and amortization   

The
Company amortizes the costs incurred to acquire patents and licenses over the period of the related agreements. The decrease year
over year in depreciation and amortization expense reflects the fact that, at the end of 2015, the Company determined that the
unamortized carrying amount recorded for the acquisition of licenses and patents related to LDN were impaired, and recorded an
impairment loss of $5,226,352. In 2014, the Company determined that the carrying amount recoded for the acquisition of licenses
and patents related to MENK were impaired, and recorded an impairment loss of $9,908,477.  

Depreciation
and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):  

The
decrease reflects the fact that all patents were fully amortized by the end of 2015.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):  

The
increase reflects the higher levels of interest-bearing debt in the third quarter of 2016. Interest expense for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 included $460 of penalties for late interest and principal payments ($0 for the quarter ended September 30,
2015).  

Loss
on settlement of debt (dollar amounts in thousands)   

In
three months ended September 30, 2016, certain lenders to the Company settled all or a portion of their notes or accounts payable
by converting them to equity. The Company recorded an expense of $274, reflecting the fair value of the shares of common stock
issued in exchange for the debt.  

In
three months ended September 30, 2015, certain lenders to the Company settled all or a portion of their notes payable or accounts
payable by converting them to equity, for which the Company recorded an expense of $1,394, reflecting the fair value of the shares
of common stock issued in exchange for the debt less the carrying value of the debt.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 (all dollar amounts and numbers in $000s, except
percentages or where otherwise indicated)    

Revenues   

We
had revenues from operations of $3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $13 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in revenues was the result of the Company s termination of its manufacturing agreement with KRS Global
Bio Technology, Inc. ( KRS ), which was cancelled by mutual agreement of the parties in May 2016. Shipments under
the agreement with Complete Pharmacy and Medical Solutions, LLC, which will replace KRS as the Company s manufacturer and
distributor of LDN tablets, have not yet commenced.  

Operating
Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows
(dollar amounts in thousands):  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses were made up as follows (dollar
amounts in thousands):  

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total cash and cash accruals for selling, general and administrative expense was $2,864
compared to $1,689 for the corresponding period in 2015, an increase of $1,175 or 70%. Significant cash items included:  

consulting
    and contractor services obtained to assist the Company in raising capital, manage investor relations, and develop business
    in new markets, in the amount of $645 in 2016, a decrease of 77 or 11% over the $722 spent in 2015. The decrease was the result
    of the conversion to equity of amounts owed to contractors from prior periods, and lower fees paid to advisors who are assisting
    the Company with manufacturing and marketing activities in the United States and Africa;   

professional
    fees for legal, tax and accounting services in the amount of $173 in 2016, a decrease of $6 or 4% over the $179 spent in 2015.
    The decrease was primarily the result of lower spending on accounting fees for non-US subsidiaries;   

payroll
    in the amount of $1,350 in 2016, an increase of $909 or 206% over the $441 spent in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable
    to $345 in accruals for Cytocom payrolls, an increase in headcount, contractually-mandated payroll increases for officers,
    and the conversion in 2015 of $282 of deferred payroll owed to a Company officer into an agreement to pay the officer a royalty
    on future product sales; and   

travel
    in the amount of $152 in 2016, an increase of $21 or 16% over the $131 spent in 2015, reflecting increased travel to Africa
    in 2016.   

Research
and development   

R D
expenses and related percentages for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):  

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total spending on R D was $295, a decrease of $408 or 58% over the $703 spent in
the same period in 2015. Expenses for research and development in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 58% compared
to expenses in the same period in 2015. The decrease occurred mainly as a result a lower spending on R D-related technical
services, the completion of most trial activity in Nigeria at the end of 2015, the settlement of a rent dispute related to premises
that were to be used to conduct R D, and the reduction in expenses recorded to settle payables related to amounts owing for
R D contracted technical services in 2016, offset by higher legal fees to maintain patents and licenses, and higher travel
fees for trials in Africa.  

Significant
cash items included:  

All
of the R D spending in 2016 was for the development of LDN, compared to 75% of spending on LDN in 2015.  

Stock
issued for services   

The
Company periodically issues stock to consultants who provide services to the Company under consulting contracts. The Company accrues
a liability for these services calculated by the number of shares issued for the services multiplied by the price of the Company s
stock on the effective date of the consulting contract. The accrued liability is amortized over the period in which the services
are provided to the Company. The Company reports these costs separately from Selling, general and administrative costs, and Research
and development costs, to better demonstrate the true costs of Selling, general and administrative activities, and Research and
development.  

Cost
of stock issued for services G A and related percentages for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows
(dollar amounts in thousands):  

The
decrease reflects the decrease in amount of stock that was issued for services.  

The
number of shares issued for prepaid consulting services G A in the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was 29,283,910 (16,922,504
in the corresponding period in 2015).  

Amortization
of prepaid consulting services G A in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the following:  

There
was no expense for amortization of stock issued for services R D and related percentages for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, due to the fact that he cost of shares issued for R D services had been fully amortized prior to the third
quarter of 2014.  

There
were no new shares issued for prepaid consulting services R D in the nine months ending September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Warrant
valuation expense (dollar amounts in thousands)   

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 25,654,908 warrants to stockholders at an exercise price range of
$0.14 to $2.00, for which it recorded an expense of $2,756. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 390,000
warrants to stockholders at an exercise price range of $0.07 to $0.50, for which it recorded an expense of $37.  

Depreciation
and amortization   

The
Company amortizes the costs incurred to acquire patents and licenses over the period of the related agreements.  

Depreciation
and amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):  

The
decrease year over year in depreciation and amortization expense reflects the fact that all of the Company s patents and
licenses had been fully amortized by December 31, 2015. At the end of 2015, the Company determined that the unamortized carrying
amount recorded for the acquisition of licenses and patents related to LDN were impaired, and recorded an impairment loss of $5,226,352.
In 2014, the Company determined that the carrying amount recoded for the acquisition of licenses and patents related to MENK were
impaired, and recorded an impairment loss of $9,908,477.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):  

The
increase reflects the increased levels of interest-bearing debt in the first nine months of 2016. Interest expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 included $1,042 of penalties for late interest and principal payments ($0 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015).  

Loss
on settlement of debt (dollar amounts in thousands)   

In
nine months ended September 30, 2016, certain lenders to the Company settled all or a portion of their notes or accounts payable
by converting them to equity. The Company recorded an expense of $1,979, reflecting the fair value of the shares of common stock
issued in exchange for the debt. In nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an expense of $1,482 to settle
all or a portion of notes or accounts payable.  

Liquidity   

Liquidity
is measured by the Company s ability to secure enough cash to meet its contractual and operating needs as they arise. The
Company had cash of $22,152 at September 30, 2016, compared to $23,149 at December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $2,333,377 and $1,903,594, respectively. $0 cash was used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ($0 was used in 2015).  

In
May 2016, the Company announced that it had received approval for sale of Lodonal TM  in Nigeria. The Company expects
to commence sales to Nigeria by the end of 2016. The Company believes that those sales will generate sufficient cash flows for
the next 12 months to pay for operating expenses and to pay off current and past-due obligations. Until such sales commence, the
Company expects to fund operations through sales of equity and notes payable, and conversions of exiting obligations into equity.
The Company believes it will require between $300,000 and $350,000 monthly to meet its ongoing expenses and obligations.  

If
the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from sales, or if it does not raise additional working capital to meet
all of its operating obligations and expenditures, the Company may have to modify its business plan.  

In
addition to the cost of its ongoing operations, the Company expects it will incur future research and development expenditures
in the next 12 months through Cytocom. Cytocom plans to conduct Phase II and Phase IIB trials for the treatment of Crohn s
disease, at an estimated cost of $3,900,000 and $7,500,000 respectively for each phase. If the trials do not commence before 2017,
the Company will be required to make a payment of $100,000 in December 2016 under its license agreements. In prior years, the
Company has been able to raise funds through sales of notes payable, and it expects to do the same for the payment due in 2016.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 proceeds from the sale of stock and exercise of stock warrants totaled $200,000, compared
to $587,500 for the corresponding period in 2015. We also received $2,132,380 from the issuance of notes payable in nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,277,975 in 2015. There were $0 loan repayments made in cash in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 ($0 in 2015).  

Off-Balance

the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item
303(a)(4) of the SEC s Regulation S-K.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form
10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13(a)-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that, because of the weakness in internal controls over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls
and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms.  

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, using the framework set
forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based upon this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the internal controls over financial reporting
were not effective. The reportable conditions and material weakness relate to a limited segregation of duties and lack of an audit
committee. The limited segregation of duties within our company and the lack of an audit committee are due to the small number
of employees. Management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This material weakness could
result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our interim
or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, due to limited staffing, we are not always
able to detect minor errors or omissions in reporting.  

Going
forward, management anticipates that additional staff will be necessary to mitigate these weaknesses, as well as to implement
other planned improvements. Additional staff will enable us to document and apply transactional and periodic controls procedures,
permit a better review and approval process and improve quality of financial reporting. However, the potential addition of new
staff is contingent on obtaining additional financing, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   

Readers
are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within our control have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
