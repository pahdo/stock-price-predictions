1. Business and Basis of Presentation 
    MPM Holdings Inc. ( Momentive ) is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. Momentive s wholly owned subsidiary, MPM Intermediate Holdings Inc. ( Intermediate Holdings ), is a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Momentive Performance Materials Inc. ( MPM ) and its subsidiaries. Momentive became the indirect parent company of MPM in accordance with MPM s plan of reorganization (the  Plan ) pursuant to MPM s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 24, 2014 (the  Effective Date  or the  Emergence Date ). Prior to its reorganization, MPM, through a series of intermediate holding companies, was controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (together with Apollo Global Management, LLC and subsidiaries,  Apollo ). Unless otherwise noted, references to  we,   us,   our  or the  Company  refer collectively to Momentive and MPM and their subsidiaries, and, unless otherwise noted, the information provided pertains to both Momentive and MPM. Differences between the financial results of Momentive and MPM represent certain management expenses of and cash received by Momentive and therefore are not consolidated within the results of MPM. 
  Based in Waterford, New York, the Company is comprised of   two   operating and reportable segments: Silicones and Quartz. Silicones is a global business engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of silicones, silicone derivatives and organofunctional silanes. Quartz, also a global business, is engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of high-purity fused quartz and ceramic materials. 
  On April 13, 2014 (the  Petition Date ), Momentive Performance Materials Holdings Inc. (MPM s direct parent prior to October 24, 2014) ( Old MPM Holdings ), MPM and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the  Bankruptcy Filing ) under Chapter 11 ( Chapter 11 ) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Court ). The Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption   In re MPM Silicones, LLC, et al.,   Case No. 14-22503. The Debtors continued to operate their businesses as  debtors-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court through the Effective Date. 
  The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority-owned subsidiaries in which minority shareholders hold no substantive participating rights. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal, recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. 
  Year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in Momentive, MPM and their subsidiaries  most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and also requires the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. In addition, it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management s estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
  Subsequent Events   As a public reporting company, the Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions through the date these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. 
  Net Income (Loss) Per Share   Momentive calculates earnings per share as the ratio of net income (loss) to weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding.  
  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. As described in Note 8, the Company adopted a new management equity plan on March 12, 2015. The fair value of stock options granted is calculated using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model on the date of the grant, and the fair value of Restricted Stock Units are valued using the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the employee s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). See Note 8 for additional details regarding stock-based compensation.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2014-09:   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the existing revenue recognition guidance and most industry-specific guidance applicable to revenue recognition. According to the new guidance, an entity will apply a principles-based five

step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  :   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which   clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  :   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients. The effective dates for these ASUs are the same as the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09. The revised effective date for ASU 2014-09 is for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and early adoption from the calendar year 2017 will be permitted. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements. 
    
        In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2014-15:    Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205)  ,  which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern (meet its obligations as they become due) within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods thereafter. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2015-11:   Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 has changed the measurement requirement of inventory within the scope of this guidance from lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance is also defining net realizable value as: the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and amendments to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2016-02:   Leases (ASC 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). Lessees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded in a contract to avoid misstating the lessee s balance sheet. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2016-09:   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). The ASU includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments will be recorded as a reduction of income taxes and reflected in operating cash flows upon the adoption of this ASU. Excess tax benefits are currently recorded in equity and as a financing activity under the current rules. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2016 early adoption will be permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09, effective April 1, 2016, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to forfeiture rates was reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings. Provisions related to income taxes have been adopted prospectively resulting in no tax benefit as of the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Board Update No. 2016-15:   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides new guidance designed to reduce existing diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues, of which the following are expected to be applicable to the Company: 1) debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, 2) proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, 3) distributions received from equity method investments, and 4) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public business entities beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years with retrospective application to each period presented is required and early adoption is permitted, The Company is currently assessing this ASU s impact on its financial statements. 
  All other new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed to be not relevant to the Company and, accordingly, are not expected to have an impact once adopted. 
   
  3. Restructuring Expenses and Other Costs 
    
  Included in restructuring and other costs are costs related to restructuring (primarily severance payments associated with work force reductions) and services and other expenses associated with cost optimization program and transformation savings activities.     
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

In November 2015 and as expanded in March and May 2016, the Company announced a global restructuring program to reduce costs through global selling, general and administrative expenses reductions and productivity actions at the Company s operating facilities. The Company expects the program cost, primarily severance related, to be approximately   $15  . Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures throughout 2016 and into 2017. These costs primarily relate to the Silicones operating segment and are included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Restructuring and other costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  In January 2016, the Company announced plans to exit siloxane production at its Leverkusen, Germany site to help optimize its manufacturing footprint in order to improve its long-term profitability by approximately $10 per year once fully implemented.  The planned reduction is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2017 and is incremental to our global restructuring program. This restructuring will result in an overall reduction of employment at the site. The Company expects the severance related costs to be approximately   $3   resulting in cash expenditures in late 2016 and into 2017. 
    
  The following table sets forth the changes in the restructuring reserve related to severance. Included in this table are also other minor restructuring programs that were undertaken by the Company in different locations, none of which were individually material. These costs are primarily related to workforce reductions: 

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized other costs of   $4   and   $4  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized other costs of   $10   and   $12  , respectively. The costs in   2015   and   2016   are primarily comprised of one-time expenses for services and integration, and are included in  Restructuring and other costs  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

4. Related Party Transactions 
  Transactions with Hexion 
  Shared Services Agreement 
    
  In October 2010, the Company entered into a shared services agreement with Hexion Inc. ( Hexion ) (which, from October 1, 2010 through October 24, 2014, was a subsidiary under a common parent and thereafter, an entity controlled by a significant shareholder of the Company) (the  Shared Services Agreement ). Under this agreement, the Company provides to Hexion, and Hexion provides to the Company, certain services, including, but not limited to, executive and senior management, administrative support, human resources, information technology, accounting, finance, legal, and procurement services. The Shared Services Agreement establishes certain criteria upon which the cost of such services are allocated between the Company and Hexion. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed for one year starting in October 2016, is subject to termination by either the Company or Hexion, without cause, on not less than 30 days  written notice, and expires in October 2017 (subject to one-year renewals every year thereafter; absent contrary notice from either party).  
  Pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred approximately   $38   and   $49  , respectively, of net costs for shared services and Hexion incurred approximately   $50   and   $58  , respectively, of net costs for shared services. Included in the net costs incurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were net billings from Hexion to the Company of   $23   and   $30  , respectively, to bring the percentage of total net incurred costs for shared services under the Shared Services Agreement to the applicable allocation percentage. The allocation percentages are reviewed by the Steering Committee pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement. The Company had accounts payable to Hexion of   $5   and   $7   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and no accounts receivable from Hexion.

5. Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy exists, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
             
    Level 1:   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
                
    Level 2:   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. 
                
    Level 3:   Unobservable inputs, that are supported by little or no market activity and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. For example, inputs derived through extrapolation or interpolation that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. 
       
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had less than   $1   of natural gas derivative contracts, which are measured using Level 2 inputs, and are included in  Other current assets  in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the natural gas derivative contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay, on a pre-tax basis, to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. Counter-parties to these contracts are

highly rated financial institutions, none of which experienced any significant downgrades that would reduce the fair value receivable amount owed, if any, to the Company. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 measurements during the three or nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Non-derivative Financial Instruments 
  The following table summarizes the carrying amount and fair value of the Company s non-derivative financial instruments: 

Fair values of debt classified as Level 2 are determined based on other similar financial instruments, or based upon interest rates that are currently available to the Company for the issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities. Fair values of debt are based upon the aggregate principal amount of each instrument, and do not include any unamortized debt discounts or premiums. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities are considered reasonable estimates of their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 
   
  6. Debt Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its senior secured asset-based revolving loan facility (the  ABL Facility ). Outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016   were   $61  , leaving an unused borrowing capacity of   $209  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all the covenants included in the agreements governing its outstanding indebtedness. 
  During 2016, the Company repurchased in the open market $29 aggregate principal amount of the Company s   4.69%   Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the  Second Lien Notes ) for $16. The Company recorded a gain of $9 net of associated discount on these notes, as a result of paying down this debt at less than its aggregate principal amount. All repurchased notes were canceled reducing the aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes outstanding from   $231   to   $202  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate of the Company s long term debt was   4.49%  . 
  Debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows:  

Momentive is not an obligor under the debt obligations above. MPM is a borrower under the ABL Facility and the issuer of the secured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of MPM (see Note 14).

7. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Non-Environmental Legal Matters 
  The Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and had reserves of   $3   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for all non-environmental legal defense costs incurred and settlement costs that it believes are probable and estimable, all of which are included in  Other current liabilities  in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Italian Tax Claim 
  On June 17, 2014, an Italian tax court of appeals (the  Italian Court of Appeals ) decided against the Company related to its 2003 income tax position resulting from the acquisition by General Electric Company ( GE ) of an Italian company in the same year. GE subsequently sold this Italian subsidiary to the Company as part of the acquisition of GE Advanced Materials in 2006 (the  GE Advanced Materials Acquisition ). Having considered the use of debt financing and other characteristics of the acquisition by GE, the Italian Court of Appeals determined that the goodwill amortization and interest expense related to the acquisition by GE were not deductible for tax purposes. Prior to this decision, the Company had received favorable rulings by lower level Italian trial courts in a series of similar cases regarding the same matter.  
  On August 7, 2014, the Italian Court of Appeals affirmed the prior decisions of the Italian tax trial courts in the Company s favor regarding the deductions made in the years 2004 through 2007. On December 29, 2014, the Company filed an appeal before the Italian Supreme Court with respect to the lower court s adverse decision related to the 2003 tax year. On January 10, 2015, the Company received notice of appeal of the favorable decision it received with respect to the years 2004 to 2007. The Company believes it has a considerable likelihood of obtaining favorable outcomes for all years contested. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total potential assessment, including penalties and interest, is    47  , or approximately   $53  , of which    32  , or approximately   $36  , relates to the period of ownership subsequent to the acquisition of GE Advanced Materials in 2006 (the  GE Advanced Materials Acquisition ).  
  The Company continues to believe its tax filing position is appropriate and that it is more likely than not this position will prevail upon appeal to the Italian Supreme Court. As a result, the Company has not recorded any income tax liability related to this matter as of   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, in conjunction with the GE Advanced Materials Acquisition, the Company and GE entered into an agreement providing for the indemnification by GE for tax matters related to the GE Advanced Materials Acquisition.  
  Environmental Matters 
  The Company is involved in certain remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs at each site are based on the Company s best estimate of discounted future costs. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had recognized obligations of   $13   for remediation costs at the Company s manufacturing facilities and off-site landfills. These amounts are included in  Other long-term liabilities  in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Waterford, NY Site 
  The Company currently owns and operates a manufacturing site in Waterford, NY. In 1988, a consent decree was signed with the State of New York which requires recovery of groundwater at the site to contain migration of specified contaminants in the groundwater. A groundwater pump and treat system and groundwater monitoring program are currently operational to implement the requirements of this consent decree. 
  Due to the long-term nature of the project and the uncertainty inherent in estimating future costs of implementing this program, this liability was recorded at its net present value of   $8  , which assumes a   3%   discount rate and an estimated time period of   50   years. The undiscounted obligations, which are expected to be paid over the estimated period, are approximately   $17  . Over the next five years the Company expects to make ratable payments totaling approximately   $2  . 
   
  8. Equity Plans and Stock Based Compensation 
  Management Equity Plan 
  On March 12, 2015, the Board of Directors of Momentive approved the MPM Holdings Inc. Management Equity Plan (the  MPMH Equity Plan ). Under the MPMH Equity Plan, Momentive can award no more than   3,818,182   shares which may consist of options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards, qualifying as equity classified awards in accordance with ASC 718  Compensation - Stock Compensation . The restricted stock units are non-voting units of measurement which are deemed to be equivalent to one common share of Momentive. The options are options to purchase common shares of Momentive. The awards contain restrictions on transferability and other typical terms and conditions. The purpose of the MPMH Equity Plan is to assist the Company in attracting, retaining, incentivizing and motivating employees and to promote the success of the Company s business by providing such participating individuals with a proprietary interest in the performance of the Company. 
  On April 10, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Momentive approved grants under the MPMH Equity Plan of restricted stock units and options to certain of the Company s key managers, including the Company s named executive officers ( NEOs )

Stock Options 
  In May 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a re-pricing of the granted stock options reducing the strike price to $  10.25   from $  20.33   based on the fair market value of Momentive s shares on May 19, 2016 and changing the market conditions vesting thresholds of Tranche A and Tranche B to be $  20   per share and $  25   per share, down from $  30.50   per share and $  40.66   per share, respectively.  Momentive treated the repricing as a modification of the original awards and calculated additional compensation costs for the difference between the fair value of the modified award and the fair value of the original award on the modification date. The repricing triggered changes in fair value of Tranche A from $  7.93   per option to $  9.83   per option and in Tranche B from $  7.62   per option to $  8.93   per option resulting in an incremental increase of $  3   in unrecognized compensation expense related to these non-vested stock options, to $  15   at May 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016. There have been no performance or market based achievements since the date of the grant, therefore, there has been no compensation expense recorded. Stock-based compensation cost related to stock options will be recognized once the satisfaction of the performance and market conditions becomes probable. 
  The estimated fair values of Stock Options originally granted in 2015 and the most recent assumptions used for the Monte Carlo option-pricing model were as follows: 

The fair market value of the underlying stock price for the purpose of determining strike prices were derived mainly from a discounted cash-flow model. The risk-free interest rate has been determined on the yields for U.S. Treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term compounded continuously which changed from 0.48% on original grant date to 0.80% on modification. The expected term represents the average of anticipated exit scenarios which changed from 1.73 years on original grant date to 1.62 years on modification. The expected volatility, which changed from 47.00% on original grant date to 60.00% on modification, has been estimated based on the volatilities using a weighted peer group of companies which are deemed to be similar to our Company and is calculated using the expected term of the stock options granted. The Tranche Market Thresholds are the average targeted expected closing prices over 10 days in the event of the underlying stocks trading publicly.

  Information on Restricted Stock Units activity is as follows: 

The fair market values related to the RSUs at the different grant dates were derived from material financial weighted analysis of the Company s value as implied at emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy or  by the sales of stock completed with related parties and adjusted to reflect current and future market conditions and the expected Company s financial performances at the grant date The material financial weighted analysis consisted of (i) a discounted cash flow analysis, (ii) a selected publicly traded company analysis and (iii) a selected transactions analysis. The employees  and NEOs  RSUs are 100% vested upon the fourth anniversary of the date of grant ( Scheduled Vesting Date ) provided that the grantee remains continuously employed in active service by the Company or one of its affiliates from the date of grant through the Scheduled Vesting Date. The directors  RSUs are 100% vested upon the first anniversary of the date of grant. 
  Additionally, vesting of the RSU grants could be accelerated: (i) upon a Sale of the Company occurring prior to the Scheduled Vesting Date, the RSUs, to the extent unvested, shall become fully vested, subject to the grantee s continued employment through the effective date of such Sale; or (ii) upon an IPO occurring prior to the Scheduled Vesting Date, a graded percentage of the RSUs, shall become vested subject to the grantee s continued employment through the effective date of the IPO.  
  There were no performance-based achievements during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The fair value of the Company s RSUs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, currently four years.  
  Stock-based compensation expense related to the RSU awards was approximately   $1   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $3   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and $1 and $2 for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation related to RSU awards was   $9   and expense will be recognized over the remaining 2.51 years vesting period. Stock-based compensation cost related to RSU awards may be accelerated once the satisfaction of one of the performance conditions outlined becomes probable.  
  Although the MPMH Equity Plan, under which the above awards were granted, was issued by Momentive, substantial underlying compensation cost represents compensation costs paid for by Momentive on MPM s behalf, as a result of the MPM s employees  services to MPM. Momentive intends to issue new stock to deliver shares under the MPMH Equity Plan. 

9. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans 
  The following are the components of the Company s net pension and postretirement (benefit) expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  (In millions, except share and option data) 

(1) 
    The curtailment gain recognized on pension benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 relates to the re-measurement of the pension benefit obligation in conjunction with plan provision changes for non-exempt employees not subject to a collective bargaining agreement ( impacted employees ). The Company recorded this gain in Selling, general and administrative expense in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (2) 
    The actuarial gain recognized on pension benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly relates to the decrease in projected benefit obligation due to the decrease in discount rate as a result of the re-measurement triggered by plan provision changes for the impacted employees. The Company recorded this gain in Selling, general and administrative expense in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
       
           (3) 
    The actuarial loss on non-pension post-retirement benefits during the nine     months ended September 30, 2016 relates to the decrease in discount rate as a result of the re-measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation on company sponsored post-retiree medical, dental, vision and life insurance benefit plans. This re-measurement on March 31, 2016 was triggered by plan provision changes for active retirees and employees not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company recorded this expense in Selling, general and administrative expense in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

10. Segment Information and Customers 
  The Company s segments are based on the products that the Company offers and the markets that it serves. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s had two reportable segments: Silicones and Quartz.

Items Not Included in Segment EBITDA 
  Not included in Segment EBITDA are certain non-cash items and other income and expenses. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , non-cash charges primarily included asset impairments and net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses related to certain intercompany arrangements. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , restructuring and other costs primarily included expenses from restructuring and certain other charges.

12. Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate was   (89)%   and   (100)%   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   (23)%   and   (24)%   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate was   (10)%   for both Momentive and MPM for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   (31)%   for both Momentive and MPM for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effective tax rates were also impacted by operating losses generated in jurisdictions where no tax benefit was recognized due to the maintenance of a full valuation allowance, tax impact of recognition of net prior service benefit following certain plan provision changes (see Note 11), a tax rate change in Japan, and the resolution of certain tax matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , income taxes included unfavorable discrete tax adjustments of   $2   and favorable discrete tax adjustments of   $11  , respectively, pertaining to benefits curtailment, a tax law change in Japan, and the resolution of certain tax matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , income taxes included unfavorable discrete tax adjustments of   $1   and   $0  , respectively, pertaining to a change in tax law in Japan and the resolution of certain tax matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
  The Company is recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in its U.S. consolidated income tax return as of   September 30, 2016   and is expecting that all earnings, with the exception of Germany and Japan, will be repatriated to the United States. The Company has accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, the Company has certain intercompany arrangements that if settled may trigger taxable gains or losses based on currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. Since the currency translation impact is considered indefinite, the Company has not provided deferred taxes on gains of   $59  , which could result in a tax obligation of   $17  , based on currency exchange rates as of   September 30, 2016  . Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or the Company change its assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion. 

13. Net Income (Loss) per Share 
  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Momentive for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Employee equity share options, unvested shares and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method is an approach used to compute the amount of new shares that can be potentially created by the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized. Treasury stock method assumes that the proceeds that a company receives from an in-the-money RSU exercise are used to repurchase common shares in the market at the average market price during the period. 
  Due to the net loss recognized for the   three and nine months ended   ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there is no effect for potentially dilutive shares.

15. Subsequent Events 
    
  On November 2, 2016, the labor union representing the Willoughby, Ohio, and Waterford, New York facilities informed Momentive that it had declared a work stoppage after several months of negotiations.  Because the Company s primary concern is the safety of its employees and the environment, Momentive subsequently placed its operations in a safe state for transition to a trained contingency work force. In addition, Momentive has built inventory to service its customers and is planning to restart operations with a contingent and salaried workforce over the next few weeks. Momentive plans to leverage a contingency workforce, global assets and inventory to serve its customers. Momentive cannot at this time estimate the financial impacts as the duration of the work stoppage is not certain, however, the strike could have a material impact on the Company. The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with the union in an effort to ratify a new collective bargaining agreement.

  Overview and Outlook 
  Business Overview 
  Momentive and MPM, together with their subsidiaries, are one of the world s largest producers of silicones, silicone derivatives and silanes and a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. Silicones are a multi-functional family of materials used in a wide variety of products and serve as a critical ingredient in many construction, transportation, healthcare, personal care, electronic, consumer and agricultural uses. Silicones and silanes are generally used as an additive to a wide variety of end products in order to provide or enhance certain of their attributes, such as resistance (heat, ultraviolet light and chemical), lubrication, adhesion or viscosity. Some of the most well-known end-use product applications include bath and shower caulk, pressure-sensitive adhesive labels, polyurethane foam products, cosmetics and tires. Due to the versatility and high-performance characteristics of silicones and silanes, they are increasingly being used as a substitute for other materials. Our Quartz business manufactures quartz, specialty ceramics and crystal products for use in a number of high-technology industries, which typically require products made to precise specifications. The cost of our products typically represents a small percentage of the overall cost of our customers  products. 
  We serve more than 4,000 customers between our Silicones and Quartz businesses in over 100 countries. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries. 
  Unless otherwise noted, references to  we,   us,   our  or the  Company  refer collectively herein to Momentive and MPM and their subsidiaries, and, unless otherwise noted, the information provided pertains to both Momentive and MPM. Differences between the financial results of Momentive and MPM represent certain management expenses of and cash received by Momentive and therefore are not consolidated within the results of MPM. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Overview  
             
    Net Sales   Net sales decreased   $51   in the   first three quarters   of   2016   as compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . The decrease was driven primarily by volume declines, pricing, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. 
                
    Net (Loss) Income    During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , net loss decreased by   $1   and   $2   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  .

Segment EBITDA   Segment EBITDA increased by   $20   and   $21   in the   first three quarters   of   2016   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, as compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  , primarily driven by stronger Silicones segment results due to better cost performance and raw material deflation. 
     Short-term Outlook  
  Our business is impacted by general economic and industrial conditions, including general industrial production, automotive builds, housing starts, construction activity, consumer spending and semiconductor capital equipment investment. Our business has both geographic and end market diversity which often reduces the impact of any one of these factors on our overall performance. 
  While we anticipate that economic volatility will continue into the last quarter of this year, we expect to see the benefits of our growth initiatives, investments in operational reliability and stability as well as the impacts of our restructuring efforts. 
  We expect the increase in liquidity resulting from our successful restructuring efforts to increase our future operational and financial flexibility. As a result, we are well positioned to leverage our leadership positions, optimize our portfolio, lower debt service requirements, and drive new growth programs. The Company s diversified portfolio remains strong and is well positioned when the markets improve. 
  We are continuing to invest in opportunities in our higher-growth product lines and geographical regions, and will leverage the combination of our proprietary technologies, strategic investments in key assets and leading presence in high-growth end markets to benefit us as the global economy recovers. We are also focused on gaining productivity efficiencies to reduce material costs and improve margins through investments in reliable and stable operations. We continue to evaluate additional actions, as well as productivity measures, that could lead to further savings. In response, we are restructuring our quartz operations and expect to achieve an additional $5 of cost reduction savings through this effort. Such actions could result in more significant restructuring, exit and disposal costs and asset impairments in the future.  
  Pursuant to our earlier announcements during the fourth quarter of 2015 and as expanded in March and May of 2016, approximately$35 in annual structural cost reduction initiatives through our global restructuring program have been implemented and are beginning to deliver savings, which are expected to be approximately $25 in 2016, of which $8 and $19 were delivered in the   third   quarter of 2016 and   first three quarters   of 2016, respectively. We have   i  ncurred approximately $15 in costs associated with the restructuring initiative as of September 30, 2016, which primarily represents severance expenses. The targeted savings are being achieved primarily through a reduction in force and delayering of our organization mostly in selling, general and administrative roles, as well as productivity actions at our operating facilities. 
  .We initiated strategic actions to address our global siloxane manufacturing capacity including, transformation of our Leverkusen, Germany facility by rationalizing siloxane capacity and making further investments in specialty assets through the   NXT*   silanes expansion, which is on track. We expect that this siloxane rationalization in Europe will reduce operating costs by approximately $10 per year when completed. We also recently announced the strategic expansion of our Leverkusen, Germany facility as part of our global initiative to expand production capabilities serving the automotive markets. Our innovative   NXT*   silane technology helps global tire producers reduce rolling resistance without the loss of wet traction. We are investing approximately $30 to expand our flagship   NXT*   silane manufacturing capacity at the Leverkusen site, which is strategically located in near proximity to multiple key customers. We also initiated strategic actions related to our Silquest* A-Link* product production expansion in Sistersville, West Virginia.     
  We remain focused on driving free cash flow and optimizing net working capital in fiscal year 2016 and expect net working capital to be a source of cash for the remainder of 2016.

  Shared Services Agreement 
  In October 2010, we entered into a shared services agreement with Hexion Inc. ( Hexion ) (which, from October 1, 2010 through October 24, 2014, was a subsidiary under a common parent and thereafter, an entity controlled by a significant shareholder of the Company) (the  Shared Services Agreement ), pursuant to which we provide to Hexion, and Hexion provides to us, certain services, including, but not limited to, executive and senior management, administrative support, human resources, information technology, accounting, finance, legal, and procurement services. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed for one year starting in October 2016 and is subject to termination by either us or Hexion, without cause, on not less than 30 days  written notice, and expires in October 2017 (subject to one-year renewals every year thereafter; absent contrary notice from either party). The Shared Services Agreement establishes certain criteria upon which the costs of such services are allocated between us and Hexion and requires that the Steering Committee formed under the agreement meet no less than annually to evaluate and determine an equitable allocation percentage. The allocation percentage is reviewed by the Steering Committee pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement.  
  The Shared Services Agreement has resulted in significant synergies for us, including shared services and logistics optimization, best-of-source contractual terms, procurement savings, regional site rationalization and administrative and overhead savings.

Matters Impacting Comparability of Results 
  Other Comprehensive Income 
  Our other comprehensive income is significantly impacted by foreign currency translation and re-measurement of actuarial gains and losses. The impact of foreign currency translation is driven by the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary assets and liabilities driving the adjustments are cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; accounts payable and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The primary currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated are the euro and Japanese yen. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from pension and postretirement liability re-measurements are recognized immediately in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These actuarial gains and losses were determined using various assumptions, the most significant of which were (i) the weighted average rate used for discounting the liability, (ii) the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, (iii) the weighted average rate of future salary increases and (iv) the anticipated mortality rate tables.  
  United Kingdom referendum to exit from the European Union 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ( E.U. ), commonly referred to as  Brexit . As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. The announcement of Brexit also caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, euros and Japanese yen against the British pound. Currently, the Company does not expect that Brexit will have a material impact on its business.

  Net Sales 
  Net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $  8  , or   1%  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to favorable volume increase of $13 in our silicone segment due to our actions to diversify our sales portfolio and favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $5 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies offset by adverse price/mix variance of $8.

In the   third   quarter of   2016  , operating income increased by   $15   for both Momentive and MPM compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Cost of sales decreased by $  12   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to raw material cost deflation of   $23   and   $15   related to lower net processing costs, partially offset by $10 due to higher sales volume, $9 in accelerated depreciation related to certain long-lived assets triggered by siloxane capacity transformation programs in Germany and $5 in exchange rate fluctuations. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by   $3   for both Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to differences in incentive accruals. Research and development expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was flat compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily related to the timing of new projects. Other operating expense increased by   $2   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , mainly due to impairment of certain equipment. 
  Non-Operating Expense 
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , total non-operating expense decreased by   $2   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   mainly due to lower interest expense and reorganization expenses not recurring during the third quarter of 2016. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  The effective tax rate was   (89)%   and   (100)%   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   (23)%   and   (24)%   for the comparable prior year period. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rates were also impacted by operating losses generated in jurisdictions where no tax benefit was recognized due to the maintenance of a full valuation allowance and recognition of net prior service benefit following certain plan provision changes (see Note 11). 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , income taxes included unfavorable discrete tax adjustments of   $2   pertaining to the resolution of certain tax matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , income taxes included unfavorable discrete tax adjustments of $1 pertaining to the resolution of certain tax matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
  The Company is recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in its U.S. consolidated income tax return as of   September 30, 2016  , and is expecting that all earnings, with the exception of Germany and Japan, will be repatriated to the United States. The Company has accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, the Company has certain intercompany arrangements that if settled may trigger taxable gains or losses based on currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. Since the currency translation impact is considered indefinite, the Company has not provided deferred taxes on gains of   $59  , which could result in a tax obligation of   $17  , based on currency exchange rates as of   September 30, 2016  . Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or the Company change its assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion. 
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , foreign currency translation positively impacted other comprehensive income by   $8  , primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.

In the third quarter of 2015, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive loss by $14, primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, partially offset by strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs.   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales in the   first three quarters   of   2016   decreased   $51  , or   3%  , compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to volume decrease of $25 caused by global economic slowdown and resulting lower demand for our core products, as well as negative price shift of $24, caused by declines in oil and gas markets. In addition, there were unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of $3 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.

Operating Income (Loss) 
  The following table sets forth the variance between the operating loss for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the operating income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  : 

During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , operating income decreased by   $24   and   $23   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . Cost of sales decreased by   $67   compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015   primarily due to raw material cost deflation of   $59  ,   $29   related to lower net processing costs and $7 related to lower sales volume, partially offset by   $20   in accelerated depreciation related to certain long-lived assets triggered by siloxane capacity transformation programs in Germany and $6 in exchange rate fluctuations. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by   $28   and   $27   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015   primarily due to the re-measurement of our pension and post retirement liabilities affecting selling, general and administrative expenses by $5 in 2016, 2015 impact of unrealized curtailment gains of $3 as a result of freezing pension benefits for certain U.S. pension plan participants, 2015 actuarial gains of $10 related to the re-measurement of our pension liabilities, and differences in incentive accruals. Research and development expense for the   first three quarters   of   2016   decreased by   $3   compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015   primarily related to the timing of new projects. Other operating expense increased by   $17  , primarily due to the inclusion of a settlement gain of $6 related to the resolution of a customer dispute in the first quarter of 2015 and $7 due to impairment of certain equipment in 2016. 
  Non-Operating Expense 
  During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , total non-operating expense decreased by   $18   compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a gain of $9 on extinguishment of Second Lien Notes, $7 due to lower reorganization expense in 2016 and $2 in lower interest expense. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  The effective tax rate was   (10)%   for both Momentive and MPM for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   (31)%   for the comparable prior year period. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rates were also impacted by operating losses generated in jurisdictions where no tax benefit was recognized due to the maintenance of a full valuation allowance, tax impact of recognition of net prior service benefit following certain plan provision changes (see Note 11), and tax rate changes in Japan. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , income taxes included favorable discrete tax adjustments of   $11   pertaining to benefits curtailment, a tax law change in Japan, and the resolution of certain tax matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
  The Company is recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in its U.S. consolidated income tax return as of   September 30, 2016  , and is expecting that all earnings, with the exception of Germany and Japan, will be repatriated to the United States. The Company has accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, the Company has certain intercompany arrangements that if settled may trigger taxable gains or losses based on currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. Since the currency translation impact is considered indefinite, the Company has not provided deferred taxes on gains of   $59  , which could result in a tax obligation of   $17  , based on currency exchange rates as of   September 30, 2016  . Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or the Company change its assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , foreign currency translation positively impacted other comprehensive income by $  67  , primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Also, for the   first three quarters   of 2016, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by   $19  , primarily due to the recognition of net prior service credit related to the effect of plan redesign triggered by certain changes to company sponsored post-retiree medical, dental, vision and life insurance benefit plans. 
  During the   first three quarters   of 2015, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive loss by $51, primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In the   first three quarters   of 2015, pension and postretirement benefit losses negatively impacted other comprehensive loss by $2 due to the recognition of prior service costs following provision changes to our U.S. pension plan. 
  Results of Operations by Segment 
  Our segments are based on the products that we offer and the markets that we serve. At   September 30, 2016  , we had two reportable segments: Silicones and Quartz. 
  Following are net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment. Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain other income and expenses. Segment EBITDA is the primary performance measure used by our senior management, the chief operating decision-maker and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA is also the profitability measure used to set management and executive incentive compensation goals. Segment EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  

(1) 
    Inter-segment sales are not significant and, as such, are eliminated within the selling segment.

Segment Results 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Following is an analysis of the percentage change in sales by business from the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Silicones 
  Net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $  10  , or   2%  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to volume increase of $13 primarily due to our actions to diversify our sales portfolio and favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $5 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. These favorable variances were offset by adverse price and mix shift of $8. 
  Segment EBITDA in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased by   $27   to   $69   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to our ongoing growth investments, cost reduction initiatives, and the benefit of raw material deflation. 
    
  Quartz 
  Net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased   $2  , or   4%  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to the softening of the end user demand. 
    
  Segment EBITDA in the   third   quarter of   2016   was flat compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
    
  Corporate 
  Corporate charges increased by   $2   and   $1   in the   third   quarter of   2016   for Momentive and MPM, respectively as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   primarily due to differences in incentive accruals.

  Net sales during the   first three quarters   of   2016   decreased   $42  , or   3%  , compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to volume decrease of $15 caused by economic downturn in Asia and lower demand for our core products, as well as negative price and mix shift of $24, caused by declines in agriculture and oil and gas markets. In addition, there were unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of $3 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. 
  Segment EBITDA during the   first three quarters   of 2016 increased by   $35   to   $189   compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to raw material deflation and management productivity programs partially offset by lower sales volume. 
    
  Quartz 
  Net sales during the   first three quarters   of   2016   decreased   $9  , or   7%  , compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to volume decrease of $10 due to the softening of the end user demand. 
  Segment EBITDA during the   first three quarters   of   2016   decreased by   $13   to   $13   compared to the   first three quarters   of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of settlement gain of $6 related to the resolution of customer dispute in the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease in sales volume as described above.

Items Not Included in Segment EBITDA 
  Not included in Segment EBITDA are certain non-cash items and other income and expenses. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , non-cash charges primarily included asset impairments and net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses related to certain intercompany arrangements. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , restructuring and other costs primarily included expenses from restructuring and certain other charges. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , non-cash charges primarily included net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses related to certain intercompany arrangements. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , restructuring and other costs primarily included expenses from restructuring, costs optimization programs, and certain other charges.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations and funds available under the ABL Facility. Our primary continuing liquidity needs are to finance our working capital, debt service and capital expenditures.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,199   of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , we had   $410   in liquidity, consisting of the following: 
     $  201   of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (of which   $120   is maintained in foreign jurisdictions); and 
             
    $209   of availability under the ABL Facility ($270 borrowing base, less   $61   of outstanding letters of credit and subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that will only apply if our availability is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27). 
     A summary of the components of our net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

The increase in net working capital of   $62   from   December 31, 2015  , was due to various market driven factors: increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, higher mix of customers with longer payment terms, buildup of inventories to meet forecast volume, demand and contingencies, and exchange rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. 
  We remain focused on driving positive free cash flow in 2016 through our global cost control initiatives and aggressively managing net working capital. To minimize the impact of net working capital on cash flows, we continue to review inventory safety stock levels where possible. We also continue to focus on receivable collections by accelerating receipts through the sale of receivables at a discount. 
  We have the ability to borrow from the ABL Facility to support our short-term liquidity requirements, particularly when net working capital requirements increase in response to seasonality of our volumes in the summer months. During the   first three quarters   of 2016, we did not draw from our ABL Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility. 
  We expect to have adequate liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future from cash on our balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under the ABL Facility.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Following are highlights from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 

Operating Activities  
  During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , the Company s operations provided   $77   and   $79   of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net loss of   $45   and   $43   for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $140 of net non-cash expense items, of which   $132   was for depreciation and amortization,   $17   was for the amortization of debt discount, and $5 of unrealized actuarial loss from other post retirement liabilities. These were offset by a $14 change in deferred tax provisions and $9 related to gain from extinguishment of our Second Lien Notes. Net working capital used $56 of cash for both Momentive and MPM, primarily, due to increases in inventory of   $31  , accounts receivable of   $13  , and a decrease in accounts payable of   $9  . Changes in other assets and liabilities, driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid, primarily included interest expense, pension plan contributions and taxes.  
  During the first three quarters of 2015, Momentive and MPM s operations provided $31 and $32 of cash, respectively. Net loss of $46 for Momentive and $45 for MPM included $118 of non-cash expense items, of which $118 was for depreciation and amortization and $17 was for the amortization of debt discount, both of which were partially offset by a $13 of realized and unrealized actuarial gains from pension liabilities. Net working capital used $53 of cash, primarily, as detailed above, due to increases in inventory of $37 and accounts receivable of $7, and a decrease in accounts payable of $9. 
  Investing Activities 
  During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , investing activities used   $84   of cash on ongoing capital expenditures related to growth, environmental, health and safety compliance and capital improvement projects. We are on track in maintaining the revised  fiscal year 2016 capital expenditure budgeted range of $125 to $130. 
  During the   first three quarters   of 2015, investing activities used $90 of cash. We spent $89 for ongoing capital expenditures related to growth, environmental, health and safety compliance, capital improvement and maintenance projects (of which $69 represented 2015 asset additions, with the remainder spent on asset additions made in prior periods).  
  Financing Activities 
  During the   first three quarters   of   2016  , Momentive and MPM s financing activities used   $14   and   $15   of cash, respectively, which primarily related to extinguishment of aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes. 
  During the first three quarters of 2015, Momentive and MPM s financing activities provided $4 and $3 of cash, respectively, which related to net short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from sale of common stock to certain of our directors by Momentive. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $61   in outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under our $270 ABL Facility, leaving unused borrowing capacity of   $209  . 
  The credit agreement governing the ABL Facility contains various restrictive covenants that prohibit us and/or restrict our ability to prepay indebtedness, including our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes (collectively, the  notes ). In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing our notes, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, make investments or declare or pay any dividends. However, all of these restrictions are subject to exceptions.  
  There are certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent of such subsidiaries in the form of cash dividends, loans or otherwise, which primarily arise as a result of certain foreign government regulations or as a result of restrictions within certain subsidiaries  financing agreements that limit such transfers to the amounts of available earnings and profits or otherwise limit the amount of dividends that can be distributed. In either case, we have alternative methods to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the form of intercompany loans and/or returns of capital in such instances where payment of dividends is limited to the extent of earnings and profits.

We have recorded deferred taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as they are not considered to be permanently reinvested as those foreign earnings are needed for operations in the United States. 
   
  Covenants under the ABL Facility and the Notes 
  The instruments that govern MPM s indebtedness contain, among other provisions, restrictive covenants (and incurrence tests in certain cases) regarding indebtedness, dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, affiliate transactions, capital expenditures and, under certain circumstances, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio, as further described below. Payment of borrowings under the ABL Facility and MPM s notes may be accelerated if there is an event of default as determined under the governing debt instrument. Events of default under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility include the failure to pay principal and interest when due, a material breach of a representation or warranty, events of bankruptcy, a change of control and most covenant defaults. Events of default under the indentures governing our notes include the failure to pay principal and interest, a failure to comply with covenants, subject to a 30-day grace period in certain instances, and certain events of bankruptcy.  
  The ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that would only apply if our availability under the ABL Facility at any time was less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27. The fixed charge coverage ratio is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments, each measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis and calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter.  
  In addition to the financial maintenance covenant described above, MPM is also subject to certain incurrence tests under the indentures governing our notes that restrict our ability to take certain actions if we are unable to meet specified ratios. For instance, the indentures governing MPM s notes contain an incurrence test that restricts MPM s ability to incur indebtedness or make investments, among other actions, if MPM does not maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio (measured on a LTM basis) of at least 2.0 to 1.0. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio under the indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. The restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments under the indentures that apply as a result, however, are subject to exceptions, including exceptions that permit indebtedness under the ABL Facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , MPM was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the notes.  
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. As we are highly leveraged, we believe that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our ability to comply with our financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense.

           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     Except as noted below, there have been no material developments in any of the ongoing legal proceedings during the   first three quarters   of   2016   for both Momentive and MPM that are included in Momentive s and MPM s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the amendments thereto. 
  Appeals Relating to the Confirmation of the Plan in the Bankruptcy Cases 
  In connection with the Bankruptcy Cases, three appeals were filed relating to the confirmation of the Plan. Specifically, on September 15, 2014, U.S. Bank National Association ( U.S. Bank ) as trustee for the Subordinated Notes filed its appeal (the  U.S. Bank Appeal ) before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  District Court ) seeking a reversal of the Court s determination that the Debtors  Plan properly denied recovery to holders of the Subordinated Notes on the basis that those debt securities are contractually subordinated to the Old Second Lien Notes. In addition, on September 16, 2014, BOKF, NA, as trustee for the Old First Lien Notes ( First Lien Indenture Trustee ) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee for the Old Secured Notes (together with U.S. Bank and First Lien Trustee, the  Appellants ) filed their joint appeal (together with the U.S. Bank Appeal, the  District Court Appeals ) before the District Court seeking reversal of the Bankruptcy Court s determinations that (i) the Debtors were not required to compensate holders of the Old First Lien Notes and Old Secured Notes for any prepayment premiums and (ii) the interest rates on First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes provided to holders of the Old First Lien Notes and Old Secured Notes under the Plan was proper and in accordance with United States Bankruptcy Code. On November 11, 2014, the Debtors also filed a motion to dismiss the District Court Appeals (the  District Court Motion to Dismiss ) with the District Court asserting, inter alia, that granting the relief requested by the Appellants would be inequitable under the legal doctrine of equitable mootness. On May 5, 2015, the District Court dismissed the District Court Appeals (the  District Court Decision ) and affirmed the Bankruptcy Court Rulings. Because the District Court Appeals were decided on their merits, the District Court also terminated the District Court Motion to Dismiss as moot. All the Appellants appealed the District Court Decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the  Second Circuit , and the appeals, the  Second Circuit Appeals ). On September 3, 2015, the Debtors filed motions to dismiss the Second Circuit Appeals (the  Second Circuit Motions to Dismiss ) with the Second Circuit asserting, inter alia, that granting the relief requested by the Appellants would be inequitable under the legal doctrine of equitable mootness. On December 16, 2015, the Second Circuit denied the Second Circuit Motions to Dismiss but permitted the Debtors to raise issues of equitable mootness in their briefs on the merits of the Second Circuit Appeals. The merits briefing of the Second Circuit Appeals has been completed and oral argument is scheduled to take place before the Second Circuit on November 9, 2016. We cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the Second Circuit Appeals. 
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
    In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A.
