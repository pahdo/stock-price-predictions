1.     ORGANIZATION 
    
  Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company  or  ACRE ) is a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate loans and related investments. Through Ares Commercial Real Estate Management LLC ( ACREM  or the Company s  Manager ), a Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) registered investment adviser and a subsidiary of Ares Management, L.P. (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management ), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager, it has investment professionals strategically located across the United States and Europe who directly source new loan opportunities for the Company with owners, operators and sponsors of commercial real estate ( CRE ) properties. The Company was formed and commenced operations in late 2011. The Company is a Maryland corporation and completed its initial public offering (the  IPO ) in May 2012. The Company is externally managed by its Manager, pursuant to the terms of a management agreement (the "Management Agreement"). 
    
  The Company is primarily focused on directly originating and managing a diversified portfolio of CRE debt-related investments for the Company s own account. The Company s target investments include senior mortgage loans, subordinated debt, preferred equity, mezzanine loans and other CRE investments, including commercial mortgage backed securities ("CMBS"). These investments are generally held for investment and are secured, directly or indirectly, by office, multifamily, retail, industrial, lodging, senior-living, self-storage and other commercial real estate properties, or by ownership interests therein.  
    
  On June 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended, the  Agreement ) with Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC (formerly known as Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (the  Buyer ), to sell ACRE Capital Holdings LLC ( TRS Holdings ), the holding company that owned the Company's mortgage banking subsidiary, ACRE Capital LLC ("ACRE Capital"). Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, on September 30, 2016, the Buyer purchased from the Company all of the outstanding common units of TRS Holdings (the  ACRE Capital Sale ). ACRE Capital primarily originated, sold and serviced multifamily and senior-living related loans under programs offered by government-sponsored enterprises and by government agencies. 
    
  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Buyer paid approximately   $93 million   in cash as consideration for the ACRE Capital Sale. The purchase price is subject to certain post-closing final working capital adjustments. The Company recognized a net gain on the sale of TRS Holdings of approximately   $10.2 million  . 
    
  The Company has elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2012. The Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that it annually distributes all of its REIT taxable income to stockholders and complies with various other requirements as a REIT. 

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.  
    
  Refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the Company's recurring accounting policies. The Company has included disclosure below regarding basis of presentation and other accounting policies that (i) are required to be disclosed quarterly or (ii) the Company views as critical as of the date of this report. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and include the accounts of the Company,  
  
   6 

the consolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) that the Company controls and of which the Company is the primary beneficiary, and the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The current period s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year ending December 31,   2016  . 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  As discussed in Note 1 included in these consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the ACRE Capital Sale on September 30, 2016. Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 205-20,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations  , defines the criteria required for a disposal transaction to qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. The Company determined that the ACRE Capital Sale met the criteria for discontinued operations. As a result, the operating results and the assets and liabilities of ACRE Capital, which formerly comprised the Mortgage Banking segment, are presented separately in the Company s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Net assets and net liabilities related to discontinued operations are included in the line items  Assets of discontinued operations  and  Liabilities of discontinued operations  in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2015, the value of ACRE Capital's assets and liabilities are presented at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value less cost to sell of ACRE Capital's assets and liabilities was greater than the carrying value; therefore, the Company did not recognize any impairment losses when the Company reclassified the assets and liabilities to discontinued operations. The operating results of discontinued operations are included in the line item  Net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes  in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Summarized financial information for the discontinued Mortgage Banking segment is shown in Note   13   included in these consolidated financial statements. 
       
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  The Company evaluates all of its interests in VIEs for consolidation. When the Company s interests are determined to be variable interests, the Company assesses whether it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. FASB ASC Topic 810,   Consolidation  , defines the primary beneficiary as the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could be potentially significant. The Company considers its variable interests, as well as any variable interests of its related parties in making this determination. Where both of these factors are present, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and it consolidates the VIE. Where either one of these factors is not present, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and it does not consolidate the VIE. 
    
  To assess whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, the Company considers all facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. 
    
  To assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Company applies judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Company. 
    
  For VIEs of which the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, all of the underlying assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses of the structures are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

7 

The Company performs an ongoing reassessment of: (1) whether any entities previously evaluated under the majority voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore are subject to the VIE consolidation framework, and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding its involvement with a VIE cause the Company s consolidation conclusion regarding the VIE to change. See Note   12   included in these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Company s VIEs. 
    
  Segment Reporting 
    
    The Company previously had   two   reportable business segments: Principal Lending and Mortgage Banking. As a result of the ACRE Capital Sale, the operations of the Mortgage Banking segment have been reclassified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The Company now conducts and manages its business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments; therefore, the Company no longer provides segment reporting. See Notes   1   and   13   included in these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sale of the Mortgage Banking segment. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Amortization of convertible notes issuance costs and accretion of convertible notes have been reclassified into amortization of deferred financing costs in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company no longer presents amortization of convertible notes issuance costs and accretion of convertible notes in its consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  The Company presents, in discontinued operations, the results of operations that have been disposed of for which the disposition represents a strategic shift that has or will have a significant effect on the Company's operations and financial results. As a result of this presentation, retroactive reclassifications that change prior period numbers have been made. See Notes   1   and   13   included in these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sale of the Mortgage Banking segment. 
    
  Loans Held for Investment 
    
  The Company originates CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, the Company will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual effective rate. 
    
  Each loan classified as held for investment is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans are collateralized by real estate. The extent of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property and the financial and operating capability of the borrower could impact the expected amounts received. The Company monitors performance of its investment portfolio under the following methodology: (1) borrower review, which analyzes the borrower s ability to execute on its original business plan, reviews its financial condition, assesses pending litigation and considers its general level of responsiveness and cooperation; (2) economic review, which considers underlying collateral (i.e. leasing performance, unit sales and cash flow of the collateral and its ability to cover debt service, as well as the residual loan balance at maturity); (3) property review, which considers current environmental risks, changes in insurance costs or coverage, current site visibility, capital expenditures and market perception; and (4) market review, which analyzes the collateral from a supply and demand perspective of similar property types, as well as from a capital markets perspective. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, and the borrower s exit plan, among other factors. 
    
  In addition, the Company evaluates the entire portfolio to determine whether the portfolio has any impairment that requires a valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the Company did not recognize any impairment charges with respect to its loans held for investment. 
    
  Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due   30   days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past  
  
   8 

due principal and interest are paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
    
  Preferred equity investments, which are subordinate to any loans but senior to common equity, are accounted for as loans held for investment and are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired, and are included within loans held for investment in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan held for investment utilizing the effective interest method. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Interest income from loans held for investment   is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount and the contractual terms of each loan. For loans held for investment, origination fees, contractual exit fees and direct loan origination costs are also recognized in interest income from loans held for investment over the initial loan term as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method.  
    
  A reconciliation of the Company's interest income from loans held for investment, excluding non-controlling interests, to the Company's interest income from loans held for investment as included within its consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is as follows ($ in thousands): 

Net Interest Margin and Interest Expense 
  Net interest margin within the consolidated statements of operations serves to measure the performance of the Company's loans held for investment as compared to its use of debt leverage. The Company includes interest income from its loans held for investment and interest expense related to its Secured Funding Agreements, securitizations debt, the Secured Term Loan and the 2015 Convertible Notes (individually defined in Note   4   included in these consolidated financial statements) in net interest margin. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , interest expense is comprised of the following ($ in thousands): 

Comprehensive Income  
    For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , comprehensive income equaled net income; therefore, a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive income is not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  . Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to  
  
   9 

customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU No. 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations  , which clarifies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 and has the same effective date as the original standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , an update on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. Additionally, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which includes amendments for enhanced clarification of the guidance. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in   Leases (Topic 840)  . Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases previously classified as operating leases. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The standard will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology pursuant to GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

3.     LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had originated or co-originated   34   loans held for investment, excluding   42   loans that were repaid or sold since inception. The aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately   $1.6 billion   and outstanding principal was   $1.4 billion  , excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties, as of   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company funded approximately   $784.3 million   of outstanding principal and received repayments of   $481.2 million   of outstanding principal, excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties, as described in more detail in the tables below. Such investments are referred to herein as the Company s "investment portfolio." As of   September 30, 2016  ,   81.2%   of the Company s loans have London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR") floors, with a weighted average floor of   0.36%  , calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or  L  are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated).

The Company s investments in loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following tables summarize the Company s loans held for investment as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   ($ in thousands):   

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal face amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. The tables above exclude non-controlling interests held by third parties. A reconciliation of the Carrying Amount of loans held for investment portfolio, excluding non-controlling interests, to the Carrying Amount of loans held for investment, as included within the Company's consolidated balance sheets, is presented below.

           (1) 
    The Company has considered the impact of the 2015 Convertible Notes and the restricted shares on diluted earnings per common share. The number of shares of common stock that the 2015 Convertible Notes are convertible into were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share because the inclusion of those shares would have been anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

8.   INCOME TAX  
    
  In December 2013 and March 2014, the Company formed two taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"), ACRC Lender W TRS LLC and ACRC Lender U TRS LLC, in order to issue and hold certain loans intended for sale. The TRS  income tax provision consisted of the following for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   ($ in thousands): 

20 

The TRS  recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  For both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an expense of $  157 thousand   for U.S. federal excise tax. Excise tax represents a   4%   tax on the required amount of the Company s ordinary income and net capital gains not distributed during the year. The quarterly expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. 
    
  The following table is a reconciliation of the TRS' statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the TRS' effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , tax years   2012   through   2015   remain subject to examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits and the Company does not expect that to change in the next 12 months. 

9.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 820-10,   Fair Value Measurement   ( ASC 820-10 ), which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for a financial instrument in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the inputs used in measuring fair value. 
    
  In accordance with ASC 820-10, the inputs used to measure fair value are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 
    
     Level I-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level II-Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk and others. 

Level III-Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period), unobservable inputs may be used. 
       
  GAAP requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the financial statements, for which it is practical to estimate the value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based upon the application of discount rates to estimated future cash flows using market yields, or other valuation methodologies. Any changes to the valuation methodology will be reviewed by the Company s management to ensure the changes are appropriate. The methods used may produce a fair value calculation that is not indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company anticipates that the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The Company uses inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which may fall within periods of market dislocation, during which price transparency may be reduced. 
    
  As of both   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any assets or liabilities required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.  

21 

As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the carrying values and fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows ($ in thousands): 

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, interest receivable, due to affiliate liability and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
    
  Loans held for investment are recorded at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs and net of an allowance for loan losses. The Company may record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis when it has determined that it is necessary to record a specific reserve against a loan and the Company measures such specific reserve using the fair value of the loan s collateral. To determine the fair value of the collateral, the Company may employ different approaches depending on the type of collateral. The Financing Agreements, CMBS debt and collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") debt are recorded at outstanding principal, which is the Company s best estimate of the fair value.  

10.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Management Agreement 
    
  The Company is party to a Management Agreement under which ACREM, subject to the supervision and oversight of the Company s board of directors, is responsible for, among other duties, (a) performing all of the Company s day-to-day functions, (b) determining the Company s investment strategy and guidelines in conjunction with the Company s board of directors, (c) sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financing, and (d) performing portfolio management duties. In addition, ACREM has an Investment Committee that oversees compliance with the Company s investment strategy and guidelines, investment portfolio holdings and financing strategy. 
    
  In exchange for its services, ACREM is entitled to receive a base management fee, an incentive fee, expense reimbursements, grants of equity-based awards pursuant to the Company s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and a termination fee, if applicable. 
    
  The base management fee is equal to   1.5%   of the Company s stockholders  equity per annum, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, stockholders  equity means: (a) the sum of (i) the net proceeds from all issuances of the Company s equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus (ii) the Company s retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter determined in accordance with GAAP (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods); less (b) (x) any amount that the Company has paid to repurchase the Company s common stock since inception, (y) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders  equity as reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (z) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between ACREM and the Company s independent directors and approval by a majority of the Company s independent directors. As a result, the Company s stockholders  equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders  equity shown in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

22 

The incentive fee is an amount, not less than   zero  , equal to the difference between: (a) the product of (i)   20%   and (ii) the difference between (A) the Company s Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous   12   month period, and (B) the product of (1) the weighted average of the issue price per share of the Company s common stock of all of the Company s public offerings of common stock multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding including any restricted shares of the Company s common stock, restricted stock units or any shares of the Company s common stock not yet issued, but underlying other awards granted under the Company s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (see Note   6   included in these consolidated financial statements) in the previous   12   month period, and (2)   8%  ; and (b) the sum of any incentive fees earned by ACREM with respect to the first   three   fiscal quarters of such previous   12   month period;   provided  ,   however  , that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any fiscal quarter unless cumulative Core Earnings for the   12   most recently completed fiscal quarters is greater than   zero  .  Core Earnings  is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of the Company s target investments are structured as debt and the Company forecloses on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions between ACREM and the Company s independent directors and after approval by a majority of the Company s independent directors. For both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , $  321 thousand   of incentive fees were incurred. For both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   no   incentive fees were incurred.  
    
  The Company reimburses ACREM at cost for operating expenses that ACREM incurs on the Company s behalf, including expenses relating to legal, financial, accounting, servicing, due diligence and other services.  
    
  The Company will not reimburse ACREM for the salaries and other compensation of its personnel, except for the allocable share of the salaries and other compensation of the Company s (a) Chief Financial Officer, based on the percentage of his time spent on the Company s affairs and (b) other corporate finance, tax, accounting, internal audit, legal, risk management, operations, compliance and other non-investment professional personnel of ACREM or its affiliates who spend all or a portion of their time managing the Company s affairs based on the percentage of their time spent on the Company s affairs. The Company is also required to pay its pro rata portion of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of ACREM and its affiliates that are required for the Company s operations. The term of the Management Agreement ends on May 1, 2017, with automatic   one  -year renewal terms thereafter. Except under limited circumstances, upon a termination of the Management Agreement, the Company will pay ACREM a termination fee equal to   three   times the average annual base management fee and incentive fee received by ACREM during the   24  -month period immediately preceding the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination, each as described above. 
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries, along with the Company s lenders under certain of the Company's Secured Funding Agreements, as well as under the CLO have entered into various servicing agreements with ACREM s subsidiary servicer, Ares Commercial Real Estate Servicer LLC ( ACRES ), a Standard   Poor s-rated commercial special servicer that is included on Standard   Poor s Select Servicer List. Effective January 1, 2015, ACREM transferred primary servicing of the Company s loans held for investment to ACRE Capital. The Company s Manager will specially service, as needed, certain of the Company s investments. Effective May 1, 2012, ACRES agreed that no servicing fees pursuant to these servicing agreements would be charged to the Company or its subsidiaries by ACRES or the Manager for so long as the Management Agreement remains in effect, but that ACRES will continue to receive reimbursement for overhead related to servicing and operational activities pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement.  
    
  Summarized below are the related party costs incurred by the Company related to continuing operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and amounts payable to the Company's Manager as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   ($ in thousands): 

23 

Credit Support Fee Agreement 
    
   In July 2014, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Support Fee Agreement with Ares Management under which the Company agreed to pay Ares Management a credit support fee in an amount equal to   1.50%   per annum times the average amount of the loans outstanding under the July 2014 CNB Facility and to reimburse Ares Management for its out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with the transaction. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred a credit support fee of $  120   thousand and   $362   thousand, respectively, under the July 2014 CNB Facility which is included within interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred a credit support fee of $  266   thousand and $  811   thousand, respectively, under the July 2014 CNB Facility which is included within interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. On September 30, 2016, the July 2014 CNB Facility was repaid in full and its terms were not extended. In conjunction with the repayment in full of the July 2014 CNB Facility, the Credit Support Fee Agreement was terminated. See Note   4   included in these consolidated financial statements for more information on the July 2014 CNB Facility. 

11.   DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s dividends declared during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   ($ in thousands, except per share data): 

12.   VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  Consolidated VIEs 
    
  As discussed in Note   2  , the Company evaluates all of its investments and other interests in entities for consolidation, including its investments in: (a) the CMBS transaction and the Company s retained interests in the subordinated classes of the certificates issued by the Trust (as defined below) it initiated and (b) the CLO transaction and the Company's retained interests in the subordinated notes and preferred equity of the Issuer (as defined below) and (c) a preferred equity investment in an LLC  
  
   24 

entity (discussed below), all of which are generally considered to be variable interests in a VIE. The Trust and Issuer together are referred herein as the Company's "Securitization VIEs."  
    
  CMBS Securitization  
    
  In connection with forming ACRE Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-FL1 (the "Trust"), ACRC 2013-FL1 Depositor LLC (the "Depositor"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of November 1, 2013 (as amended on March 28, 2014, the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement") with Wells Fargo as master servicer, ACRES as servicer, U.S. Bank National Association as trustee, and Trimont Real Estate Advisors Inc. as trust advisor. The Trust was treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a real estate mortgage investment conduit.  
    
  The Pooling and Servicing Agreement governed the issuance of approximately   $493.8   million aggregate principal balance commercial mortgage pass through certificates in a CMBS effected by the Depositor. In connection with the securitization, the Depositor contributed a pool of   18   adjustable rate participation interests in commercial mortgage loans to the Trust. The commercial mortgage loans were originated by the Company or its subsidiaries and were secured by   27   commercial properties. The certificates represented, in the aggregate, the entire beneficial ownership interest in, and the obligations of, the Trust.  
    
  In connection with the securitization, the Company offered and sold the following classes of certificates: Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates (collectively, the "Offered Certificates") to third parties pursuant to an offering made privately in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.   A  s of   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate principal balance of the Offered Certificates was approximately   $61.9   million. In addition, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company retained approximately   $98.8   million of the certificates. The Company, as the holder of the subordinated classes of the Trust, had the obligation to absorb losses of the Trust, since the Company had a first loss position in the capital structure of the Trust. 
  On June 17, 2016, the Company terminated the Trust, and in connection therewith, exchanged its remaining certificates for the remaining mortgage loans held by the Trust. All of the Offered Certificates of the Trust held by third parties have been repaid in full.  
  CLO Securitization  
    
  On August 15, 2014, ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2014-FL2 Ltd. (the "Issuer") and ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2014-FL2 LLC ("Co-Issuer"), both wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an indenture with Wells Fargo as advancing agent and note administrator and Wilmington Trust, National Association as trustee, which governs the issuance of approximately   $346.1   million principal balance secured floating rate notes (the "Notes") and   $32.7   million of preferred equity in the Issuer. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuer and Co-Issuer are disregarded entities. 
           
  The Notes are collateralized by interests in a pool of   15   mortgage assets having a total principal balance of   $378.8   million (the "Mortgage Assets") originated by a subsidiary of the Company. The sale of the Mortgage Assets to the Issuer is governed by a Mortgage Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of August 15, 2014, between ACRC Lender LLC and the Issuer. In connection with the securitization, the Issuer and Co-Issuer offered and sold the following classes of Notes: Class A, Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class D Notes to third parties. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Company retained approximately   $37.4   million of the most subordinate Notes and all of the preferred equity in the Issuer. The Company, as the holder of the subordinated Notes and all of the preferred equity in the Issuer, has the obligation to absorb losses of the CLO, since the Company has a first loss position in the capital structure of the CLO. As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the aggregate principal balance of the Offered Notes was approximately   $57.8   million and   $193.4   million, respectively. 
    
  Summary of Securitization VIEs 
    
  As the directing holder of the CMBS and the CLO, the Company has the ability to direct activities that could significantly impact the Securitization VIEs  economic performance. If an unrelated third party had the right to unilaterally remove the special servicer, then the Company would not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the Securitization VIEs' economic performance. In addition, there are no substantive kick-out rights of any unrelated third party to remove the special servicer without cause. The Company s subsidiaries, as directing holders, have the ability to remove the special servicer without cause. Based on these factors, the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of these Securitization VIEs; thus, the Securitization VIEs are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

25 

ACRE Capital is designated as primary servicer and ACRES as special servicer of the CMBS and the CLO. ACRES has the power to direct activities during the loan workout process on defaulted and delinquent loans, which is the activity that most significantly impacts the Securitization VIEs' economic performance. ACRE Capital and ACRES waive the servicing and special servicing fees and the Company pays its overhead costs, as with other servicing agreements.  
    
  The Securitization VIEs consolidated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 810 are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying collateral and distribute those payments to the certificate and note holders, as applicable. The assets and other instruments held by the Securitization VIEs are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the Securitization VIEs. Additionally, the obligations of the Securitization VIEs do not have any recourse to the general credit of any other consolidated entities, nor to the Company as the primary beneficiary. 
    
  The inclusion of the assets and liabilities of Securitization VIEs of which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary has no economic effect on the Company. The Company s exposure to the obligations of Securitization VIEs is generally limited to its investment in these entities. The Company is not obligated to provide, nor has it provided, any financial support for any of these consolidated structures. As such, the risk associated with the Company s involvement in these Securitization VIEs is limited to the carrying value of its investment in the entity. As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the Company s maximum risk of loss was   $70.1   million and   $168.8   million, respectively, which represents the carrying value of its investment in the Securitization VIEs. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred interest expense related to the Securitization VIEs of   $640   thousand and   $3.0   million, respectively, which is included within interest expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred interest expense related to the Securitization VIEs of   $1.8 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, which is included within interest expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Investment in VIE 
    
  On December 19, 2014, the Company and third party institutional investors formed a limited liability company, ACRC KA, which acquired   $170.0   million of preferred equity in a REIT whose assets were comprised of a portfolio of   22   multifamily, student housing, medical office and self-storage properties managed by its sponsor. The Company s investment in ACRC KA is considered to be an investment in a VIE. As of both   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the Company owned a controlling financial interest of   51.0%   of the equity shares in the VIE and the third party institutional investors owned the remaining   49.0%  , a minority financial interest. The preferred equity shares are entitled to a preferred monthly return over the term of the investment at a fixed rate of   10.95%   per annum.  
       
  ACREM is the non-member manager of the VIE. Based on the terms of the ACRC KA LLC agreement, ACREM has the ability to direct activities that could significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. There are no substantive kick-out rights held by the third party institutional investors to remove ACREM as the non-member manager without cause. As ACREM serves as the manager of the Company, the Company has the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. As such, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the party that is most closely associated with the VIE. Thus, the VIE is consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements and the preferred equity interests owned by the third party institutional investors are reflected as a non-controlling interest held by third parties within the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the preferred equity investment, which is net of unamortized fees and origination costs, was   $94.1   million and   $93.9   million, respectively, and is included within loans held for investment in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The risk associated solely with respect to the Company s investment in this VIE is limited to the outstanding principal of its investment in the entity. As of both   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the Company s maximum risk of loss solely with respect to this investment was   $48.5   million. 
    
  Unconsolidated VIEs 
    
  The Company also holds variable interests in VIEs structured as preferred equity investments, where the Company does not have a controlling financial interest. For these structures, the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and the Company does not consolidate these VIEs. These preferred equity investments are accounted for as loans held for investment and are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired, and are included within loans held for investment in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  The Company is not obligated to provide, nor has it provided, any financial support for any of the Company s unconsolidated VIEs. As such, the risks associated with the Company s involvement in these unconsolidated VIEs are limited to the outstanding principal of the Company s investment in the entity. 
  
   26 

The following table presents the carrying value and the maximum exposure to loss of unconsolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   ($ in thousands): 

13.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  ACRE Capital primarily originated, sold and serviced multifamily and senior-living related loans under programs offered by government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and by government agencies, such as the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) and the Federal Housing Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (together with Ginnie Mae,  HUD ). ACRE Capital was approved as a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing ( DUS ) lender, a Freddie Mac Program Plus  Seller/Servicer, a Multifamily Accelerated Processing and Section 232 LEAN lender for HUD, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. While ACRE Capital earned little interest income from these activities because it generally only held loans for short periods, ACRE Capital received origination fees when it closed loans and sale premiums when it sold loans. ACRE Capital also retained the rights to service the loans, which were known as mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ), and received fees for such servicing during the life of the loans, which generally lasted   10   years or more.  
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company closed the ACRE Capital Sale for an approximately   $93 million   purchase price in accordance with the Agreement dated June 28, 2016. The purchase price is subject to certain post-closing final working capital adjustments.  
    
  Discontinued Operations - Financial Summary 
    
  The following information reconciles the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets: 

27 

The following information reconciles the net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, that are presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations:   

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Servicing fees   were earned for servicing mortgage loans, including all activities related to servicing the loans, and were recognized as services were provided over the life of the related mortgage loan. Also included in servicing fees were the net fees earned on borrower prepayment penalties and interest earned on borrowers  escrow payments and interim cash balances, along with other ancillary fees and reduced by write-offs of MSRs for loans that were prepaid, changes in the fair value of the servicing fee payable (defined below) and interest expense related to escrow accounts. ACRE Capital provided additional payments to certain personnel by providing them with a percentage of the servicing fee revenue that was earned by ACRE Capital, which was initially recorded as a liability when ACRE Capital committed to make a loan to a borrower (the  servicing fee payable ). Servicing fees, net are included within net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Gains from mortgage banking activities   included the initial fair value of MSRs, loan origination fees, gain on the sale of loans originated, interest income and fees earned on loans held for sale, changes to the fair value of derivative financial instruments attributable to the loan commitments and forward sale commitments and reduced by the expense related to the initial fair value of the servicing fee payable and the interest expense related to the Warehouse Lines of Credit (as defined below). The initial fair value of MSRs, loan origination fees, gain on the sale of loans originated, certain direct loan origination costs for loans held for sale and the expenses related to the initial fair value of the servicing fee payable were recognized when ACRE Capital committed to make a loan to a borrower. When ACRE Capital settled a sale agreement and transferred the mortgage loan to the buyer, ACRE Capital recognized a MSR asset equal to the present value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of loans sold. Gains from mortgage banking activities are included within net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Mortgage Servicing Rights  
    
  When a mortgage loan was sold, ACRE Capital retained the right to service the loan and recognized the MSR at fair value. The initial fair value represented expected net cash flows from servicing, as well as interest earnings on escrows and interim cash balances, borrower prepayment penalties, delinquency rates, late charges along with ancillary fees that were discounted at a rate that reflected the credit and liquidity risk of the MSR over the estimated life of the underlying loan. After  
  
   28 

initial recognition, changes in the MSR fair value are included within net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the change occurred.  
    
  MSRs represented servicing rights retained by ACRE Capital for loans it originated and sold. The servicing fees were collected from the monthly payments made by the borrowers. ACRE Capital generally received other remuneration including rights to various loan fees such as late charges, collateral re-conveyance charges, loan prepayment penalties and other ancillary fees. In addition, ACRE Capital was also generally entitled to retain the interest earned on funds held pending remittance related to its collection of loan principal and escrow balances. As of   December 31, 2015  , ACRE Capital had a servicing portfolio (excluding ACRE s loans held for investment portfolio) consisting of   973   loans with an unpaid principal balance of   $4.9   billion, which included   953   GSE / HUD loans with an unpaid principal balance of   $4.3   billion and   20   other loans (managed by an affiliate of the Manager) with an unpaid principal balance of   $554.8   million. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of ACRE Capital s MSRs for the GSE and HUD loan portfolio was approximately   $61.8 million  . 
    
  Activity related to MSRs as of and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows ($ in thousands): 

_________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1)  
    MSRs are included in mortgage servicing rights at fair value as of   December 31, 2015   in the reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.  
       
  ACRE Capital determined the fair values of the MSRs based on discounted cash flow models that calculated the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The fair values of ACRE Capital s MSRs were subject to changes in discount rates. For example, a   100   basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate decreased or increased, respectively, the fair value of ACRE Capital s MSRs outstanding as of   December 31, 2015   by approximately   $2.0   million. 
    
  Warehouse Lines of Credit 
    
  ACRE Capital borrowed funds under the ASAP Line of Credit and the BAML Line of Credit (individually defined below and together, the  Warehouse Lines of Credit ).  
    
  ASAP Line of Credit 
    
  ACRE Capital was party to a multifamily as soon as pooled ( ASAP ) sale agreement with Fannie Mae (the  ASAP Line of Credit ) to finance installments received from Fannie Mae. To the extent the ASAP Line of Credit remained active through utilization, there was no expiration date. The commitment amount was subject to change at any time at Fannie Mae's discretion. In July 2016, ACRE Capital temporarily increased the ASAP Line of Credit limit from   $80.0 million   to   $140.0 million   through August 31, 2016. Fannie Mae advanced payment to ACRE Capital in   two   separate installments according to the terms as set forth in the ASAP sale agreement. The first installment was considered an advance to ACRE Capital from Fannie  
  
   29 

Mae and not a sale until the second advance and settlement was made.  As of December 31, 2015, there was   no   outstanding balance on the ASAP Line of Credit.   
    
  BAML Line of Credit 
    
  ACRE Capital was party to a   $135.0   million line of credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the  BAML Line of Credit ), which was used to finance mortgage loans originated by ACRE Capital. The stated interest rate on the BAML Line of Credit was   LIBOR   Daily Floating Rate plus   1.60%  . In June 2016, ACRE Capital amended the BAML Line of Credit to extend the maturity date to June 29, 2017. In July 2016, ACRE Capital temporarily increased its BAML Line of Credit from   $135.0   million to   $175.0 million   from July 29, 2016 through August 8, 2016. ACRE Capital incurred a non-utilization fee of   12.5   basis points on the daily available balance of the BAML Line of Credit to the extent less than   40%   of the BAML Line of Credit was utilized. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , ACRE Capital incurred a non-utilization fee of   $23 thousand   and   $80 thousand  , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, ACRE Capital incurred a non-utilization fee of   $18 thousand   and   $50 thousand  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding balance on the BAML Line of Credit was $  24.8 million  . 
    
  The ASAP Line of Credit and BAML Line of Credit were included in Warehouse Lines of Credit as of   December 31, 2015   in the reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that are presented separately in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  Allowance for Loss Sharing 
    
  When a loan was sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, ACRE Capital undertook an obligation to partially guarantee the performance of the loan. The date ACRE Capital committed to make a loan to a borrower, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee was recognized. Subsequent to the initial commitment date, ACRE Capital monitored the performance of each loan for events or circumstances which would signal an additional liability to be recognized if there was a probable and estimable loss. The initial fair value of the guarantee was estimated by examining historical loss share experienced in the ACRE Capital Fannie Mae DUS portfolio over the most recent   10  -year period. The initial fair value of the guarantee was included within net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. These historical loss shares served as a basis to derive a loss share rate which was then applied to the current ACRE Capital DUS portfolio (net of specifically identified impaired loans that were subject to a separate loss share reserve analysis).  
    
  Loans originated and sold by ACRE Capital to Fannie Mae under the Fannie Mae DUS program were subject to the terms and conditions of a Master Loss Sharing Agreement, which was amended and restated in 2012. Under the Master Loss Sharing Agreement, ACRE Capital was responsible for absorbing certain losses incurred by Fannie Mae with respect to loans originated under the DUS program, as described below in more detail. The compensation for this risk of loss was a component of servicing fees on the loan. 
    
  The losses incurred with respect to individual loans were allocated between ACRE Capital and Fannie Mae based on the loss level designation ( Loss Level ) for the particular loan. Loans were designated as Loss Level I, Loss Level II or Loss Level III. All loans were designated Loss Level I unless Fannie Mae and ACRE Capital agreed upon a different Loss Level for a particular loan at the time of the loan commitment, or if Fannie Mae determined that the loan was not underwritten, processed or serviced according to Fannie Mae guidelines. 
    
  Losses on Loss Level I loans were shared   33.33%   by ACRE Capital and   66.67%   by Fannie Mae. The maximum amount of ACRE Capital s risk-sharing obligation with respect to any Loss Level I loan was   33.33%   of the original principal amount of the loan. Losses incurred in connection with Loss Level II and Loss Level III loans were allocated disproportionately to ACRE Capital until ACRE Capital had absorbed the maximum level of its risk-sharing obligation with respect to the particular loan. The maximum loss allocable to ACRE Capital for Loss Level II loans was   30%   of the original principal amount of the loan, and for Loss Level III loans was   40%   of the original principal amount of the loan. 
    
  According to the Master Loss Sharing Agreement, Fannie Mae would unilaterally increase the amount of the risk-sharing obligation of ACRE Capital with respect to individual loans without regard to a particular Loss Level if (a) the loan did not meet specific underwriting criteria, (b) the loan was defaulted within   12   months after it was purchased by Fannie Mae or (c) Fannie Mae determined that there was fraud, material misrepresentation or gross negligence by ACRE Capital in its underwriting, closing, delivery or servicing of the loan. Under certain limited circumstances, Fannie Mae required ACRE Capital to absorb   100%   of the losses incurred on a loan by requiring ACRE Capital to repurchase the loan. 

30 

The amount of loss incurred on a particular loan was determined at the time the loss was incurred, for example, at the time a property was foreclosed by Fannie Mae (whether acquired by Fannie Mae or a third party) or at the time a loan was modified in connection with a default. Losses were determined by reference to the price paid by a third party at a foreclosure sale or by reference to an appraisal obtained by Fannie Mae in connection with the default on the loan. 
    
  In connection with the Company s acquisition of ACRE Capital from Alliant, Inc., a Florida corporation, and The Alliant Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (the  Sellers ), the Sellers were jointly and severally obligated to (i) fund directly (if permitted) or to reimburse ACRE Capital for amounts due and owing after the closing date to Fannie Mae pursuant to ACRE Capital s allowance for loss sharing with respect to settlement of certain DUS program mortgage loans originated and serviced by ACRE Capital, subject to certain limitations and (ii) to indemnify ACRE Capital for, among other things, certain losses arising from Sellers  failure to fulfill the funding or reimbursement obligations described above. As of   December 31, 2015  , the preliminary estimate of the portion of such contributions towards such losses relating to the allowance for loss sharing of ACRE Capital was $  377   thousand. Additionally, with respect to the settlement of certain non-designated DUS program mortgage loans originated and serviced by ACRE Capital, the Sellers were jointly and severally obligated to fund directly (if permitted) or to reimburse ACRE Capital in each of the   three     12  -month periods following the closing date for eighty percent (  80%  ) of amounts due and owed after the closing date to Fannie Mae pursuant to ACRE Capital s allowance for loss sharing in excess of   $2.0   million during such   12   month period; provided that in no event would the Sellers obligations exceed in the aggregate   $3.0   million for the entire   three   year period. 
    
  ACRE Capital used several tools to manage its risk-sharing obligation, including maintenance of disciplined underwriting and approval processes and procedures, and periodic review and evaluation of underwriting criteria based on underlying multifamily housing market data and limitation of exposure to particular geographic markets and submarkets and to individual borrowers. In situations where payment under the guarantee was probable and estimable on a specific loan, ACRE Capital recorded an additional liability. The amount of the provision reflected ACRE Capital s assessment of the likelihood of payment by the borrower, the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral and the level of risk-sharing. Historically, among other factors, the loss recognition occurred at or before the loan became   60   days delinquent. 
    
  A summary of ACRE Capital s allowance for loss sharing as of and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows ($ in thousands): 

_________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1)  
    Allowance for loss sharing was included in allowance for loss sharing as of   December 31, 2015   in the reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that are presented separately in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  
       
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the maximum quantifiable allowance for loss sharing associated with ACRE Capital s guarantees under the Fannie Mae DUS agreement was $  1.1   billion from a total recourse at risk pool of   $3.2 billion  . Additionally, as of   December 31, 2015  , the non-at risk pool was   $64.8   million. The at risk pool was subject to Fannie Mae s Master Loss Sharing Agreement and the non-at risk pool was not subject to such agreement. The maximum quantifiable allowance for loss sharing was not representative of the actual loss ACRE Capital would incur. ACRE Capital would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it serviced for Fannie Mae, for which ACRE Capital retained some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  
   31 

Commitments to extend credit by ACRE Capital were generally agreements to lend to a customer as long as there was no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally had fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may have required payment of a fee. Occasionally, the commitments expired without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts did not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of   December 31, 2015  , ACRE Capital had the following commitments to sell and fund loans ($ in thousands): 

Derivatives 
    
  Non-designated Hedges 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedges were derivatives that did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under GAAP or for which ACRE Capital had not elected to designate as hedges.  
    
  Loan commitments and forward sale commitments 
    
  ACRE Capital entered into loan commitments with borrowers on loan originations whereby the interest rate on the prospective loan was determined prior to funding. In general, ACRE Capital simultaneously entered into forward sale commitments with investors in order to hedge against the interest rate exposure on loan commitments. The forward sale commitment with the investor locked in an interest rate and price for the sale of the loan. The terms of the loan commitment with the borrower and the forward sale commitment with the investor were matched with the objective of hedging interest rate risk. Loan commitments and forward sale commitments were considered undesignated derivative instruments. Accordingly, such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, were recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, ACRE Capital entered into   30   and   49   loan commitments, respectively, and   30   and   49   forward sale commitments, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, ACRE Capital entered into   20   and   67   loan commitments, respectively, and   20   and   67   forward sale commitments, respectively.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , ACRE Capital had   16   loan commitments with a total notional amount of   $207.6   million and   24   forward sale commitments with a total notional amount of   $237.4   million, with maturities ranging from   25   days to   17   months, that were not designated as hedges in qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  MSR purchase commitments 
    
  In July 2015, ACRE Capital entered into a purchase agreement with a third party to purchase the servicing rights for a HUD loan. Under the purchase agreement, the purchase price for the servicing rights was     $325   thousand   and ACRE Capital assumed the rights to service the loan in March 2016.

and liabilities of discontinued operations that are presented separately in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See above for more information.  
    
  Income Tax 
    
  The net deferred tax liability is a retained liability of TRS Holdings. As a result of the ACRE Capital Sale, the Company no longer has a net deferred tax liability as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  The Company established a taxable REIT subsidiary, TRS Holdings, in connection with the acquisition of ACRE Capital. TRS Holdings' income tax provision consisted of the following for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   ($ in thousands): 

Deferred income taxes reflected the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net by tax jurisdiction and are included within assets or liabilities of discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, TRS Holdings  U.S. tax jurisdiction was in a net deferred tax liability position. TRS Holdings was not subject to tax in any foreign tax jurisdiction. 
    
  The following table presents the U.S. tax jurisdiction and the tax effects of temporary differences on the respective net deferred tax assets and liabilities of TRS Holdings as of   December 31, 2015   ($ in thousands): 

Based on TRS Holdings  assessment, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized through future taxable income.  
    
  TRS Holdings recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within net income from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties for TRS Holdings, if any, were included within liabilities of discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  The following table is a reconciliation of TRS Holdings' statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to TRS Holdings' effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

33 

As of   September 30, 2016  , tax years   2012   through   2015   remained subject to examination by taxing authorities. TRS Holdings did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. 
    
  Intercompany Notes 
    
  In connection with the acquisition of ACRE Capital, the Company partially capitalized TRS Holdings with a   $44.0   million note. In October 2014, the Company entered into an   $8.0   million revolving promissory note with TRS Holdings (collectively, the   two   intercompany notes described above are referred to as the  Intercompany Notes ).  In connection with the ACRE Capital Sale, the Intercompany Notes were repaid in full with the proceeds from the sale on September 30, 2016. As of   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding principal balance of the Intercompany Notes was   $51.9   million. The income statement effects of the Intercompany Notes were eliminated in consolidation for financial reporting purposes, but the interest income and expense from the Intercompany Notes affected the taxable income of the Company and TRS Holdings.   
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
    
  See Note   9   included in these consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company's fair value of financial instruments policy.  
    
  Financial Instruments Reported at Fair Value 
    
  ACRE Capital had certain assets and liabilities that were required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Financial instruments reported at fair value in the Company's consolidated financial statements included MSRs, MSR purchase commitments, loan commitments, forward sale commitments and loans held for sale.  See above for more information on MSRs, MSR purchase commitments, loan commitments and forward sale commitments. 
    
  The following table summarizes the levels in the fair value hierarchy into which ACRE Capital s financial instruments were categorized as of   December 31, 2015   ($ in thousands): 

There were no transfers between the levels as of   December 31, 2015  . Transfers between levels were recognized based on the fair value of the financial instrument at the beginning of the period. 
       
  Loan commitments and forward sale commitments were valued based on a discounted cash flow model that incorporated changes in interest rates during the period. The MSRs and the MSR purchase commitment were valued based on discounted cash flow models that calculated the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model considered contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. The loans held for sale were valued based on discounted cash flow models that incorporated quoted observable prices from market participants. The valuation of derivative instruments were determined using  
  
   34 

widely accepted valuation techniques, including market yield analyses and discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.

The table above is not intended to be all-inclusive, but instead is intended to capture the significant unobservable inputs relevant to ACRE Capital s determination of fair values. Changes in market yields, discount rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may have changed the fair value of the financial instruments. Generally, an increase in market yields or discount rates or a decrease in EBITDA multiples may have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the financial instruments. 
    
  The Company s management is responsible for the Company s fair value valuation policies, processes and procedures related to Level III financial instruments. The Company s management reports to the Company s Chief Financial Officer, who has final authority over the valuation of the Company s Level III financial instruments.

See above for more information.  
       
  See above MSR reconciliation for the changes in MSRs that were classified as Level III. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the total carrying value and fair value of ACRE Capital's Warehouse Lines of Credit classified as Level II in the fair value hierarchy were both $  24.8   million. The Warehouse Lines of Credit were recorded at outstanding principal, which was the Company s best estimate of the fair value. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, due to affiliate liability and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
    
  Related Party Transactions

  We were formed and commenced operations in late 2011. We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in May 2012.  We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with various other requirements as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. 
    
  We are an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to  opt out   
  
   38 

of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 
    
  We could remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 
    
  Sale of Mortgage Banking Subsidiary 
       
  On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended, the  Agreement ) with Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC (formerly known as Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (the  Buyer ), to sell TRS Holdings, the holding company that owned our mortgage banking subsidiary, ACRE Capital. Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, on September 30, 2016, the Buyer purchased from us all of the outstanding common units of TRS Holdings (the  ACRE Capital Sale ). ACRE Capital primarily originated, sold and serviced multifamily and senior-living related loans under programs offered by government-sponsored enterprises and by government agencies. 
    
  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Buyer paid approximately   $93 million   in cash as consideration for the ACRE Capital Sale. The purchase price is subject to certain post-closing final working capital adjustments. We recognized a net gain on the sale of TRS Holdings of approximately $  10.2   million. 
    
  The ACRE Capital Sale provides us with additional capital to reinvest in our core business. As a result of the sale of TRS Holdings, the operations of the Mortgage Banking segment have been reclassified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the ACRE Capital Sale, we no longer provide segment reporting.

  Factors Impacting Our Operating Results 

39 

The results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial mortgage loans, CRE debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, credit worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers. 
    
  Stock Buyback Program 
    
  In May 2015, we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of one year (the "Stock Buyback Program"). In February 2016, we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the existing $20.0 million Stock Buyback Program to $30.0 million and extended the Stock Buyback Program through March 31, 2017. Purchases made pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time and as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. Repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In connection with this Stock Buyback Program, in March 2016, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with certain parameters set forth in the Stock Buyback Program. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased a total of   129,916   shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $  1.4   million, including expenses paid. The shares were repurchased at an average price of $  11.06   per share, including expenses paid.  
    
  Investment Portfolio 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have originated or co-originated   34   loans held for investment, excluding   42   loans that were repaid or sold since inception. Such investments are referred to herein as our investment portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately $  1.6   billion and outstanding principal was $  1.4   billion, excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we funded approximately $  784.3   million of outstanding principal and received repayments of $  481.2   million of outstanding principal, excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   81.2%   of our loans have London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR") floors, with a weighted average floor of   0.36%  , calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or  L  are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated).  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no impairments with respect to our loans held for investment. 
    
  Our loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of   September 30, 2016   ($ in thousands): 

_____________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal face amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. 
              (2) 
    Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by us as of   September 30, 2016   as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan.

Non-Controlling Interests 
    
  The non-controlling interests held by third parties in our consolidated financial statements represent the equity interests in ACRC KA Investor LLC ("ACRC KA") that are not owned by us.

The following tables set forth select details of our consolidated results of operations from continuing operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   ($ thousands): 
    
  Net Interest Margin  

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , net interest margin was approximately $  11.8   million and $12.2 million, respectively. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , interest income from loans held for investment of $  20.8   million and $20.9 million, respectively, was generated by weighted average earning assets of $  1.2   billion, offset by $  9.0   million and $8.7 million, respectively, of interest expense, unused fees and amortization of deferred loan costs. The weighted average borrowings under the Wells Fargo Facility, the Citibank Facility, the BAML Facility, the March 2014 CNB Facility, the July 2014 CNB Facility, the MetLife Facility, the UBS Facilities and the U.S. Bank Facility (individually defined above or below and collectively, the "Secured Funding Agreements") and securitization debt, the Secured Term Loan and convertible notes were $  850.9   million and $894.7 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. The decrease in net interest margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to a decrease in interest income from non-controlling interests for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , net interest margin was approximately $  32.5   million and $37.5 million, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , interest income from loans held for investment of $  58.5   million and $65.1 million, respectively, was generated by weighted average earning assets of $  1.2   billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, offset by $  26.0   million and $27.6 million, respectively, of interest expense, unused fees and amortization of deferred loan costs. The weighted average borrowings under the Secured Funding Agreements and securitization debt, the Secured Term Loan and convertible notes were $  843.5   million and $956.5 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. The decrease in net interest margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to a decrease in our weighted average earning assets and a decrease in interest income from non-controlling interests for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Operating Expenses  
    
    The operating expenses below do not include expenses of ACRE Capital. See Note   13   to our consolidated financial statements included in this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   for more information about the operating expenses of ACRE Capital. 
  
   42 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we incurred operating expenses of $  3.9   million and $3.5 million, respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to incentive fees due to our Manager and an increase in our use of third party professionals for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we incurred operating expenses of $  10.6   million and $10.3 million, respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to incentive fees due to our Manager for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Related Party Expenses 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , related party expenses included $  1.4   million in management fees due to our Manager and $  0.9   million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement.

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , there were no incentive fees due to our Manager. 
    
  Other Expenses 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , professional fees were $  0.7   million and $0.6 million, respectively. The increase in professional fees for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to an increase in our use of third party professionals. For both the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , general and administrative expenses were $  0.7   million. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , professional fees were $  1.7   million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase in professional fees for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to an increase in our use of third party professionals. For both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , general and administrative expenses were $  2.1   million. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. We use significant cash to purchase our target investments, make principal and interest payments on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. Our primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under the Secured Funding Agreements, the net proceeds of future offerings, payments of principal and  
  
   43 

interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating activities. However, principal repayments from mortgage loans in the collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") securitization are applied sequentially, first going to pay down the senior CLO notes, and accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from repayment of loans in the CLO until all senior notes are repaid in full. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from the 1940 Act, we expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit, secured funding and other lending facilities, (b) securitizations, (c) other sources of private financing, including warehouse and repurchase facilities, and (d) public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities. See  Recent Developments  included in this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   for information on our available capital as of   November 2, 2016  . We may seek to sell certain of our investments in order to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risk, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions.  
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table sets forth changes in cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , which are inclusive of amounts related to discontinued operations ($ in thousands): 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , cash and cash equivalents increased by $  32.8   million and decreased by $6.2 million, respectively.  
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , net cash provided by operating activities totaled $  0.2   million and $204.6 million, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included originations of mortgage loans held for sale of $  639.4   million, sale of mortgage loans held for sale to third parties of $  571.7   million, change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) of $  6.5   million, gain on sale of discontinued operations of $  10.2   million and change in other assets of $  39.7   million. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included originations of mortgage loans held for sale of $575.0 million, sale of mortgage loans held for sale to third parties of $685.1 million, change in the fair value of MSRs of $7.0 million, change in restricted cash of $41.9 million and change in other assets of $18.9 million. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , net cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled $  (242.5)   million and $197.3 million, respectively. This change in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment exceeding the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment and cash received from the sale of discontinued operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by financing activities totaled $  275.0   million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $  1.3   billion, proceeds from our secured term loan of $  80.0   million and proceeds from our Warehouse Lines of Credit (defined below) of $  863.4   million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $  932.4   million, repayments of debt of consolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) of $  197.4   million and repayments of our Warehouse Lines of Credit of $  795.7   million. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash used in financing activities totaled $408.0 million and primarily related to repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $201.6 million, repayments of debt of consolidated VIEs of $243.7 million and repayments of  
  
   44 

our Warehouse Lines of Credit (defined below) of $777.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $170.5 million and proceeds from our Warehouse Lines of Credit (defined below) of $668.1 million. 
    
  We, through our previously owned subsidiary, ACRE Capital, borrowed funds under the ASAP Line of Credit and the BAML Line of Credit (individually defined below and together, the  Warehouse Lines of Credit ). ACRE Capital was party to a $80.0 million multifamily as soon as pooled sale agreement (the  ASAP Line of Credit ) with the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") to finance installments received from Fannie Mae. ACRE Capital was party to a $135.0 million line of credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended and restated, the  BAML Line of Credit ), which was used to finance mortgage loans originated by ACRE Capital. 
  Summary of Financing Agreements 
    
  The sources of financing under our Secured Funding Agreements and the Secured Term Loan (collectively, the "Financing Agreements") are described in the following table ($ in thousands):  
   
 ______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    The maturity date of the master repurchase funding facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the  Wells Fargo Facility ) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. Beginning on December 14, 2015, new advances under the Wells Fargo Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) 30 day LIBOR plus (ii) a pricing margin range of 1.75% to 2.35%. Advances on loans made prior to December 14, 2015 under the Wells Fargo Facility continue to accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) 30 day LIBOR plus (ii) a pricing margin range of 2.00% to 2.50%. In June 2016, we amended the Wells Fargo Facility to, among other things, increase the size of the facility from $225.0 million to $325.0 million and extend the initial maturity date to December 14, 2017. 
              (2) 
    The Citibank Facility is subject to three 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In July 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Citibank Facility, which added an accordion feature that provides for an increase in the $250.0 million commitment amount with respect to approved assets, as determined by Citibank, N.A. in its sole discretion. 
              (3) 
    In August 2016, we amended and restated the existing BAML Facility to increase its commitment size from $50.0 million to $125.0 million. Individual advances on loans under the BAML Facility generally have a two-year maturity, subject to a 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. 
              (4) 
    We have one 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid, which, if exercised, would extend the final maturity of the secured revolving funding facility with City National Bank (the  March 2014 CNB Facility ) to March 10, 2018. 
     
   45 

(6) 
    The revolving master repurchase facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the "MetLife Facility") is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. 
              (7) 
    The price differential (or interest rate) on the revolving master repurchase facility with UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. (the  April 2014 UBS Facility ) is one-month LIBOR plus (i) 1.88% per annum, for assets that are subject to an advance for one year or less, (ii) 2.08% per annum, for assets that are subject to an advance in excess of one year but less than two years, and (iii) 2.28% per annum, for assets that are subject to an advance for more than two years; in each case, excluding amortization of commitment and exit fees.  
              (8) 
    The global master repurchase agreement with UBS AG (the  December 2014 UBS Facility,  and together with the April 2014 UBS Facility, the "UBS Facilities") has been repaid in full and its terms were not extended.  
              (9) 
    The U.S. Bank Facility is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. Advances under the U.S. Bank Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.25%, unless otherwise agreed between U.S. Bank and the Company, depending upon the mortgage loans sold to U.S. Bank in the applicable transaction.  
              (10) 
    The Secured Term Loan has a LIBOR floor of 1.0% on drawn amounts.  
       
  Our Financing Agreements contain various affirmative and negative covenants, including negative pledges, and provisions related to events of default that are normal and customary for similar financing agreements. See Note   4   to our consolidated financial statements included in this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   for more information on our Financing Agreements.  
    
  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Collateralized Loan Obligations  
    
  We may seek to enhance the returns on our senior mortgage loan investments through securitizations, if available. To the extent available, we intend to securitize the senior portion of some of our loans, while retaining the subordinate securities in our investment portfolio. The securitization of this senior portion will be accounted for as either a  sale  and the loans will be removed from our balance sheet or as a  financing  and will be classified as  loans held for investment  in our consolidated balance sheets, depending upon the structure of the securitization.  
    
  The following table summarizes our securitizations debt as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 ($ in thousands): 

See Note   12   to our consolidated financial statements included in this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   for additional terms and details of our securitizations. 
    
  Capital Markets 
    
  We may periodically raise additional capital through public offerings of debt and equity securities to fund new investments. In June 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), which became effective on August 29, 2016, in order to permit us to offer, from time to time, in one or more offerings or series of offerings up to $1.25 billion of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase shares of our common stock, warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, or units.  
  
   46 

Other Sources of Financing 
    
  In addition to the sources of liquidity described above, in the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments or to refinance expiring Financing Agreements and securitizations, including other credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities, non-convertible or convertible debt, securitized financings and other public and private forms of borrowing. These financings may be issued by us or our subsidiaries, be collateralized or non-collateralized, accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates and may involve one or more lenders. 
    
  Leverage Policies 
    
  We intend to use prudent amounts of leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders. To that end, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we intend to continue to use borrowings to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments. Given current market conditions and our focus on first or senior mortgages, we currently expect that such leverage would not exceed, on a debt-to-equity basis, a 4-to-1 ratio. Our charter and bylaws do not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use. The amount of leverage we will deploy for particular investments in our target investments will depend upon our Manager s assessment of a variety of factors, which may include, among others, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy generally or in specific geographic regions and commercial mortgage markets, our outlook for the level and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve. 

Dividends 
    
  We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, anticipate distributing at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains and determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Internal Revenue Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. If a REIT distributes less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the  Required Distribution ) to its stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then it is required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.      
  Before we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our Financing Agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We have commitments to fund various senior mortgage loans, as well as subordinated debt and preferred equity investments in our portfolio. 
    
  Other than as set forth in this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q  , we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose entities or VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intend to provide additional funding to any such entities. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
       
  As of   November 2, 2016  , we had approximately $  132   million in capital, either in cash or in approved but undrawn capacity under our borrowing facilities. After holding in reserve $10 million in liquidity requirements, we expect to have  
  
   47 

approximately $  122   million in capital available to fund new loans, fund outstanding commitments on existing loans, repurchase our common shares and for other working capital and general corporate purposes. Assuming that we use all such amounts as capital to make new senior loans and we are able to leverage such amounts under our secured funding agreements at a debt to equity ratio of 2.5:1, we would have the capacity to fund approximately $  425    million of additional senior loans.  
    
  As of   November 2, 2016  , the total unfunded commitments for our existing loans held for investment were approximately $  92   million. In addition, borrowings under our Secured Funding Agreements were approximately $  852   million, borrowings under our Secured Term Loan was approximately $  155   million and debt issued in the form of CLO was approximately $  21   million. 
       
  On   November 3, 2016  , we declared a cash dividend of $  0.26   per common share for the   fourth   quarter of   2016  . The   fourth   quarter   2016   dividend is payable on   January 17, 2017   to common stockholders of record as of   December 30, 2016  .

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
    
  As part of our risk management strategy, our Manager closely monitors our portfolio and actively manages the credit, interest rate, market, prepayment, real estate inflation and financing risks associated with holding a portfolio of our target investments. We manage our portfolio through an interactive process with our Manager and Ares Management and service our target investments through a combination of direct servicing by ACRE Capital and use of our Manager's servicer. ACRE Capital and one of its subsidiaries serve as the primary servicer of our investments. ACRE Capital is a Standard   Poor s rated commercial primary servicer that is also included on Standard   Poor s Select Servicer List. Our Manager's servicer, which is a Standard   Poor's rated commercial special servicer that is included on Standard   Poor's Select Servicer List, serves as the special servicer for non-routine investment servicing issues. Our Manager has an Investment Committee that oversees compliance with our investment strategy and guidelines, investment portfolio holdings and financing strategy. We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe the risks can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage those risks, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake.  
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with holding our target investments. We have exposure to credit risk on our CRE loans and other target investments in our business. Our Manager seeks to manage credit risk by performing our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. Credit risk is also addressed through our Manager s ongoing review of our investment portfolio. In addition, with respect to any particular target investment, our Manager s investment team evaluates, among other things, relative valuation, comparable analysis, supply and demand trends, shape of yield curves, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations, including our borrowings under the Financing Agreements. We primarily originate or acquire floating rate mortgage assets and finance those assets with index-matched floating rate liabilities. As a result, we significantly reduce our exposure to changes in portfolio value and cash flow variability related to changes in interest rates.  However, we regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk and assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not we should enter into hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments, such as forward sale commitments and interest rate floors in order to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
    
  While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our investments. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk. 
    
  In addition to the risks related to fluctuations in asset values and cash flows associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of non-performance on floating rate assets. In the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the additional debt service payments due from our borrowers may strain the operating cash flows of the real estate assets underlying our mortgages and, potentially, contribute to non-performance or, in severe cases, default. 
    
  Interest Rate Effect on Net Interest Margin 
   Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing. The cost of our borrowings generally is based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally increase while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate mortgage assets remain static, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin.  
    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the following fluctuations in the average 30-day LIBOR would have resulted in the following increases in net interest margin on our loans held for investment ($ in millions): 
  
   49 

The severity of any such impact depends on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase and any applicable floors and caps. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target investments. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. 
    
  Interest Rate Cap and Floor Risk 
    
  We primarily originate or acquire floating rate mortgage assets. These are assets in which the mortgages may be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which limit the amount by which the asset s interest yield change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements sometimes are not subject to similar restrictions or have different floors and caps. As a result, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps, while the interest rate yields on our floating rate mortgage assets could be limited if we do not implement effective caps. In addition, floating rate mortgage assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of less cash income on such assets than we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings. In addition, in a period of decreasing interest rates, the interest rate yields on our floating rate mortgage assets could decrease, while the interest rate costs on certain of our borrowings could be fixed at a higher floor. These factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of decreasing interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  The estimated fair values of our investments fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate securities would be expected to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate securities would be expected to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our investments may be adversely impacted. 
    
  Prepayment and Securitizations Repayment Risk 
    
  Our net income and earnings may be affected by prepayment rates on our existing CRE loans. When we originate our CRE loans, we anticipate that we will generate an expected yield. When borrowers prepay their CRE loans faster than we expect, we may be unable to replace these CRE loans with new CRE loans that will generate yields which are as high as the prepaid CRE loans. Additionally, principal repayment proceeds from mortgage loans in the CLO are applied sequentially, first going to pay down the senior CLO notes. We will not receive any proceeds from repayment of loans in the CLO until all senior notes are repaid in full. 
    
  Financing Risk 
    
  We borrow funds under our Financing Agreements to finance our target assets. Over time, as market conditions change, in addition to these financings, we may use other forms of leverage. Weakness or volatility in the financial markets, the commercial real estate and mortgage markets and the economy generally could adversely affect one or more of our potential lenders and could cause one or more of our potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or to increase the costs of that financing. 
    
  Real Estate Risk 
    
  Commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns  
  
   50 

and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; local markets with a significant exposure to the energy sector; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loan or loans, as the case may be, which could also cause us to suffer losses. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes.  
    
  Inflation Risk 
    
  Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to interest rates. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. In each case, in general, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon such evaluation, the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of   September 30, 2016  , to provide assurance that information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
    
  In the normal course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings from time to time. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.  

Item 1A.   Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2.   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  Stock Buyback Program 
    
  In May 2015, we announced that the Company's board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a period of one year. In February 2016, we announced that the Company's board of directors increased the size of the existing $20.0 million Stock Buyback Program to $30.0 million and extended the Stock Buyback Program through March 31, 2017. Purchases made pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time and as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. Repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  In connection with this Stock Buyback Program, in March 2016, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with certain parameters set forth in the Stock Buyback Program.

AMENDMENT TO GUARANTY 
  THIS AMENDMENT TO GUARANTY (this    Amendment   ) is entered into as of September 22, 2016 by ARES COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (   Guarantor   ), and METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, a New York corporation   (   Buyer   ). 
  RECITALS 
  WHEREAS  , Guarantor entered into that certain Guaranty in favor of Buyer, dated as of August 13, 2014 (the    Original Guaranty   ) relating to that certain Master Repurchase Agreement, dated as of August 13, 2014, between ACRC Lender ML LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (   Seller   ) and Buyer (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the    Repurchase Agreement    and
