 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Pershing Gold Corporation (the  Company ),
formerly named Sagebrush Gold Ltd., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 2, 2007. The Company
is a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development opportunities primarily in Nevada. The Company
is currently focused on exploration of its Relief Canyon properties in Pershing County in northwestern Nevada. None of the Company s
properties contain proven and probable reserves, and all of the Company s activities on all of its properties are exploratory
in nature. 

On August 30, 2011, the Company, through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold Acquisition Corp. ( Gold Acquisition ), acquired the Relief Canyon Mine property
( Relief Canyon ) located in Pershing County, near Lovelock, Nevada. 

A wholly-owned subsidiary, Pershing Royalty
Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed on May 17, 2012 to hold royalty interests in two gold exploration properties.
On July 5, 2016 a wholly-owned subsidiary, Blackjack Gold Corporation, a Nevada corporation, was formed for potential purchases
of exploration targets. 

On June 17, 2015, the Board of Directors of
the Company approved a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common
Stock ), at a ratio of 1-for-18 (the  Reverse Stock Split ) which became effective on June 18, 2015. In connection
with the Reverse Stock Split, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,
as amended, with the Nevada Secretary of State to reduce the number of shares of Common Stock the Company is authorized to issue
from 800,000,000 to 200,000,000. All share and per share values of the Company s Common Stock for all periods presented in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the Reverse Stock Split in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 4C: Equity Accounts   Change in Capital Structure ( SAB Topic 4C ). 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of presentation and principles of
consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) and present the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. All adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company s
financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 have been included. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. The accounting policies and procedures employed in the preparation of these consolidated
financial statements have been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015, which are contained in the Company s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
on March 22, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, contained herein, was derived from those financial
statements. 

Use of estimates  

In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date
of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly
from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the useful life of property
and equipment, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowance, amounts and timing of closure
obligations, the assumptions used to calculate fair value of restricted stock units, options and warrants granted, stock-based
compensation, beneficial conversion on preferred stock, capitalized mineral rights, asset valuations, timing of the performance
criteria of restricted stock units and the fair value of common stock issued. 

Cash and cash equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high credit
quality financial institutions. The Company s accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. 

PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had bank
balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such
financial institutions, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. 

Restricted cash  

Restricted cash consists of cash and investments which are held
as collateral under a surface management surety bond issued on the Company s behalf. 

Fair value of financial instruments  

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), for assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally
accepted accounting principles that requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company s
financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

These inputs are prioritized below: 

Level 1:  
      Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   
 
      Level 2:  
      Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.   
 
      Level 3:  
      Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions.   

The Company analyzes all financial instruments
with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) accounting
standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The carrying amounts reported
in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate their estimated fair market values based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. 

Prepaid expenses and other current assets  

Prepaid expenses and other current assets of
$477,906 and $899,228 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future
services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments for consulting, public relations, and
business advisory services, insurance premiums, drilling services, mining claim fees and mineral lease fees which are being amortized
over the terms of their respective agreements. 

Mineral property acquisition and exploration
costs  

Costs of leasing, exploration, carrying and
retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred
as it is still in the exploration stage. If the Company identifies proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties
and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future costs until production
is established. 

When a property reaches the production stage,
the related capitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the proven and probable
reserves. If in the future the Company has capitalized mineral properties, these properties will be periodically assessed for impairment.
To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs
are being expensed.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

ASC 930-805,  Extractive Activities-Mining:
Business Combinations  ( ASC 930-805 ), states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract,
and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights. Acquired mineral rights
are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the
acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral
rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims. 

ASC 930-805-30-1 and 30-2 provide that in fair
valuing mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both: 

The value beyond proven and probable reserves ( VBPP )
to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.  

The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price
of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.  

Property and equipment  

Property and equipment are carried at cost.
The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are
retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life of the assets, generally one to twenty-five years. 

Impairment of long-lived assets  

The Company accounts for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets according to ASC 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment . The Company continually monitors
events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including mineral rights,
may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets in the exploration stage are monitored for impairment based on factors such as the Company s
continued right to explore the area, exploration reports, assays, technical reports, drill results and the Company s continued
plans to fund exploration programs on the property, and whether sufficient work has been performed to indicate that the carrying
amount of the mineral property cost carried forward as an asset will not be fully recovered. The tests for long-lived assets in
the exploration stage are monitored for impairment based on factors such as current market value of the long-lived assets and results
of exploration, future asset utilization, business climate, mineral prices and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from the use of the related assets. 

Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset. When necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information
available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting estimated future cash flows.
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary
significantly from such estimates. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company did not record any impairment of its long-lived assets at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Asset Retirement Obligations  

Asset retirement obligations ( ARO ),
consisting primarily of estimated mine reclamation and closure costs at the Company s Relief Canyon property, are recognized
in the period incurred and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations,
which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to
accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life. Asset retirement obligations are periodically adjusted to reflect
changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs.
The Company reviews and evaluates its asset retirement obligations annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed necessary.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued) 

Income taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant
to the provision of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Income Taxes  ( ASC 740-10 ), which requires, among other
things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. 

The Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10
related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits
of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10,
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence,
management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of
appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. 

Tax positions that meet the more likely than
not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized
upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed
the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance
sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. 

The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25,  Definition
of Settlement , which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for
the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon
the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively
settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than
not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open.  The
federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally
for three years after they are filed. 

Stock-based compensation  

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based
on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC
718 ), which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services
in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director
services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. 

Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50,  Equity
Based Payments to Non-employees , for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is
determined at the  measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement
date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense
based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. 

Related party transaction  

Parties are considered to be related to the
Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate
families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls
or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Recent accounting pronouncements  

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest
  Imputation of Interest  (Subtopic 835-30) which focuses on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The
amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet
as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement
guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The ASU is effective for periods beginning
after December 15, 2015 for public companies. The Company s adoption did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated
results of operations, financial position and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ), which requires entities to present deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the current guidance
in ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes , which requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities
as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2015-17 to be material on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases  (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance
or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification
will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater
than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing
guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within those annual periods and is applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the
process of assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ). as part of FASB's simplification initiative focused on improving
areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity may be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed
within the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 focuses on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions,
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will evaluate the effect of ASU 2016-09 for future periods. 

In August 2016,
FASB issued ASU 2016-15 ,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15
addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon
debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest
rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies);
distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable
cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The
Company does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

Other accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact
on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

NOTE 3   MINERAL PROPERTIES 

The Company s Relief Canyon property
rights currently total approximately 25,000 acres and are comprised of approximately 948 owned unpatented mining claims, 120 owned
millsite claims, 172 leased unpatented mining claims, and 2,235 acres of leased and 2,770 acres of subleased private lands. Most
of the property on which the Relief Canyon deposit is located is subject to a 2% net smelter return production royalty, with a
portion of that property subject to net smelter return production royalties totaling 4.5%. The rest of the property is subject,
under varying circumstances, to net smelter return production royalties ranging from 2% to 5%. 

Pershing Pass Property  

The Pershing Pass property consists of over
700 unpatented mining claims covering approximately 12,000 acres and a mining lease of private lands covering approximately 600
acres.  Out of the total unpatented mining claims, 17 unpatented mining claims are subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty
and 19 unpatented mining claims are leased with a purchase option. 

The primary term of the unpatented mining claim
lease referenced above is ten years ending in January 2023, which may be extended as long as mineral exploration, development or
mining continue on the property. Production from the lease is subject to a 1% net smelter return royalty on precious metals and
a 0.5% net smelter royalty on all other metals produced from the leased property. Prior to production, and starting in September 2016,
the Company is required to pay a $10,000 annual advance minimum royalty payment until September 2023. The annual advance minimum
royalty payment increases to $12,500 in September 2023, to $15,000 in September 2028 and to $20,000 in September 2033. 
The Company has the right to buy the leased claims at any time for $250,000. 

Prior to one year after commercial production
begins, the Company can repurchase up to 3% of the royalty on gold production at the rate of $600,000 for each 1%. 

Newmont Properties  

On April 5, 2012, the Company purchased
from Victoria Gold Corp. and Victoria Resources (US) Inc. (collectively,  Victoria ) their interest in approximately
13,300 acres of mining claims and private lands adjacent to the Company s original landholdings at the Relief Canyon Mine
in Pershing County, Nevada. 

Approximately 8,900 acres of the lands that
the Company acquired from Victoria were a leasehold interest comprised of unpatented mining claims and private lands subject to
a 2006 Mineral Lease and Sublease with Newmont USA Ltd. ( Newmont ), which the Company refers to as the Newmont Leased
property. At that time, the Newmont Leased property consisted of 155 unpatented lode mining claims owned by Newmont comprising
approximately 2,800 acres, approximately 4,900 acres of privately-owned fee minerals leased by Newmont from the owners, and
62 unpatented mining claims that were owned by Victoria within the Newmont Leased property and area of interest. 

On January 14, 2015, the Company entered into
an Asset Purchase Agreement with Newmont (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company acquired for
$6.0 million, 74 unpatented mining claims totaling approximately 1,300 acres that the Company had previously leased from Newmont,
and entered into a new mining lease directly with New Nevada Resources, LLC and New Nevada Lands, LLC for approximately 1,600 acres
of fee, or private, land that the Company had previously subleased from Newmont. 

As part of the January 2015 transactions completed
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a Mining Lease (the  2015 Mining Lease )
with New Nevada Resources, LLC and New Nevada Lands, LLC (the  Owners ), covering certain fee lands (the  Leased
Properties ) included in the Company s Relief Canyon properties. The 2015 Mining Lease has a term of twenty years and
for as long thereafter as any mining, development or processing operations are being conducted on a continuous basis. The 2015
Mining Lease contains customary terms and conditions, including an advance royalty and a 2.5% net smelter returns production royalty
on the Leased Properties payable to the Owners.

Newmont Leased Property  

As part of the Asset Purchase Agreement transactions,
Newmont and the Company entered into an amendment of the 2006 Minerals Lease and Sublease (the  Third Amendment ),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to a $2.6 million work commitment on the properties remaining subject to the 2006 Minerals
Lease and Sublease to be expended by the seventh anniversary of the effective date of the Third Amendment. Upon the eighth anniversary
of the effective date of the Third Amendment, the Company shall pay an annual rental payment of $10.00 per acre if the Company
does not incur $500,000 in qualified expenditures during the preceding year. Expenditures incurred in excess of the annual work
commitment or rental payment obligation may be carried forward as credits against future annual work commitment obligations or
rental payment obligations. As of June 15, 2016, the most recent cost reporting date, the Company can credit approximately $2.8
million in exploration expenditures already incurred against the $2.6 million work commitment and future rental payment obligations. 

Also as part of the transactions completed
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Newmont and the Owners entered into a new Mining Lease (the  2015 Newmont Lease )
covering about 2,770 acres of private lands included in the Company s Relief Canyon properties (the  Subleased Properties )
and subleased by the Company from Newmont pursuant to the 2006 Minerals Lease and Sublease. The 2015 Newmont Lease has a term of
twenty years and for as long thereafter as any mining, development or processing operations are being conducted on a continuous
basis. The 2015 Newmont Lease contains customary terms and conditions, including an advance royalty and a 2.5% net smelter returns
production royalty on the Subleased Properties payable to the Owners. The Company continues to hold rights to the Subleased Properties
pursuant to its 2006 Minerals Lease and Sublease with Newmont. 

General  

The Company has posted a statewide surface
management surety bond with the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) as required
by the State of Nevada in an amount of approximately $5.6 million, which is approximately $30,000 in excess of the coverage requirement
as of September 30, 2016, to reclaim land disturbed in its exploration and mining operations. The surface management surety bond
is provided through a third-party insurance underwriter. When the bond was issued in November 2013, the Company was required to
place $2,250,000, or 45% of the original $5.0 million bond, in a collateral account. No further collateral has been required for
subsequent increases in the bond amount. The funds deposited in the collateral account are classified as restricted cash on the
Company s balance sheet. 

As of September 30, 2016, based on management s
review of the carrying value of mineral rights, management determined that there is no evidence that the cost of these acquired
mineral rights will not be fully recovered and accordingly, the Company determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of
mineral rights was required. As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has not established any proven
or probable reserves on its mineral properties and has incurred only acquisition and exploration costs.

NOTE 7   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 

On June 17, 2015, the Board of Directors of
the Company approved a reverse stock split of the Company s Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-18 (the  Reverse Stock
Split ) which became effective on June 18, 2015. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the Company filed a Certificate
of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Nevada Secretary of State to reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock the Company is authorized to issue from 800,000,000 to 200,000,000. All share and per share values
of the Company s Common Stock for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively
restated for the effect of the Reverse Stock Split in accordance with SAB Topic 4C. 

Preferred Stock  

The Company is authorized within the limitations
and restrictions stated in the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to provide by resolution or resolutions for the issuance
of 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share in such series and with such designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions as the Company s
Board of Directors establishes.

As of September 30, 2016, 15,151 shares of
Series E Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value, were authorized with 8,946 Series E Preferred shares outstanding. 

During February 2016 a holder of Series E Preferred
Stock converted one Series E share into 292 shares of the Company s Common Stock.

Preferred Deemed Dividend  

In connection with a February 4, 2016 private
placement of shares of the Company s Common Stock (as discussed below), the conversion price for the Series E Preferred Stock
was reduced effective February 4, 2016 from $5.04 to $3.40 per share of Series E Preferred Stock. Following this adjustment, each
share of Series E Preferred Stock was convertible into the number of shares of common stock obtained by dividing the Series E Original
Issue Price, of $990.00, by the adjusted conversion price, resulting in each share of Series E Preferred Stock being convertible
into approximately 291.176 shares of common stock. A total of 9,375 shares of Series E Preferred Stock remained outstanding at
the time of adjustment, and as a result of the adjustment, were convertible into approximately 2,729,780 shares of common stock
in the aggregate, compared to 1,841,528 shares of Common Stock prior to the adjustment. The adjusted conversion price generated
additional value to the convertibility feature of the Series E Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Company recorded a preferred deemed
dividend of approximately $3.02 million for the additional value of the beneficial conversion feature in February 2016, the period
of the adjustment.

Additionally, in connection with a February
25, 2016 private placement of shares of the Company s Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
Common Stock (as discussed below), the conversion price for the Series E Preferred Stock was further reduced effective February
25, 2016 from $3.40 to $3.25 per share of Series E Preferred Stock. Following this adjustment, each share of Series E Preferred
Stock is convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the Series E Original Issue Price, of $990.00,
by the adjusted conversion price, resulting in each share of Series E Preferred Stock being convertible into approximately 304.615
shares of Common Stock. A total of 9,374 shares of Series E Preferred Stock remained outstanding at the time of adjustment, and
as a result of the adjustment, are convertible into approximately 2,855,469 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, compared to
2,729,489 shares of Common Stock prior to the adjustment. The adjusted conversion price generated additional value to the convertibility
feature of the Series E Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Company recorded an additional preferred deemed dividend of approximately
$580,000 for the additional value of the beneficial conversion feature in February 2016, the period of the adjustment.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This Report on Form 10-Q and other written
and oral statements made from time to time by us may contain so-called  forward-looking statements,  all of which are
subject to risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  expects, 
 plans,   will,   forecasts,   projects,   intends,   estimates, 
and other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements relating to our planned
expenditures, business goals, planned exploration and metallurgical work, our 2016 drilling program, business strategy, planned
permitting activities, geographic surveys and certain pre-feasibility level studies of the Relief Canyon Mine, plans with respect
to an environmental studies to expand the Relief Canyon open-pit mines, our efforts to obtain external financing, our liquidity
and capital resources outlook and future financing requirements, and estimates and assumptions required under our financial statements.  Forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions.  Our
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified.  Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements include, without limitation, results of
future exploration, engineering studies and planned pre-feasibility studies on our Relief Canyon properties; increases in estimates
or costs of exploration and other activities; our ability to raise necessary capital to conduct our exploration and other activities
and do so on acceptable terms or at all; results from exploration and changes in interpretations of geological, metallurgical or
other technical information; problems or delays in permitting or other government approvals; and the matters described in the risk
factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Overview  

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we focused primarily on the development and commencement of our 2016 drilling program to expand the Relief Canyon Mine deposit;
continuing permitting, engineering and other work related to the potential commencement of mining at the Relief Canyon Mine; and
financing efforts. An overview of certain significant events during the nine month period follows: 

During the period, we continued to progress
pre-feasibility level geotechnical studies for the Relief Canyon Mine. These studies will provide the basis for a third party Pre-Feasibility
Study for the Relief Canyon Mine, expected to be completed in early 2017.    

In August 2016 the BLM approved our Environmental
Assessment and Plan of Operations Modification for the Relief Canyon Mine Expansion. This approval expands our pit boundary and
deepening of the pit and also increases permissible drilling areas around the existing pits.    

In July 2016 we commenced Phase 1 of our
2016 Drilling Campaign. Phase 1 is focused on increasing the resource at the Relief Canyon Mine and continuing to upgrade the Relief
Canyon mine pit economics.    

In June 2016 Mine Development Associates
( MDA ) completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment ( PEA ) for our Relief Canyon gold mine. The work done
to date as presented in the PEA prepared by MDA provides the economic data to support further efforts to advance the project.    

In June 2016 we appointed D. Scott Barr
to our Board of Directors. Mr. Barr possesses more than 35 years of metallurgical and mine operations experience.    

In March 2016 we completed a private placement
and raised approximately $6.0 million in net proceeds after expenses and legal fees, through the issuance of a total of 1,850,000
shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 925,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.35 per share.    

In February 2016 we completed two private
placements and raised approximately $8.1 million in gross proceeds, or $7.4 million in net proceeds after commissions, expenses
and legal fees, through the issuance of a total of 2,488,529 shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 1,322,019 shares
of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.06 per share.    

Results of Operations  

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015  

Net Revenues   

We are an exploration stage company with no
operations, and we generated no revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Operating Expenses   

Total operating expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, were approximately $3.6 million and $5.9 million,
respectively. The $2.3 million decrease in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised largely
of a $1.9 million decrease in exploration expenses on our Relief Canyon properties to approximately $1.5 million from $3.4 million
in the prior period due to less direct drilling activities during the current period, a decrease of $0.2 million in compensation
expense to approximately $0.9 million from $1.1 million in the prior period due to a decrease in recognition of stock based compensation
related to vested restricted stock units, a decrease of $0.1 million in general and administrative expenses to approximately $1.0
million from $1.1 million in the prior period, primarily due to decreased public company expenses and legal costs and a decrease
of $0.1 million in consulting fees to approximately $0.2 million from $0.3 million in the prior period. 

Total operating expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, were approximately $10.0 million and $14.1 million,
respectively. The $4.1 million decrease in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised largely
of a $3.8 million decrease in exploration expenses on our Relief Canyon properties to approximately $2.4 million from $6.2 million
in the prior period due to less direct drilling activities during the current nine month period, and a decrease of $0.8 million
in general and administrative expenses to approximately $2.9 million from $3.7 million in the prior period, primarily due to decreased
public company expenses and legal costs offset by an increase of $0.1 million in consulting expense to approximately $1.1 million
from $1.0 million in the prior period as a result of increase in investor relations and business advisory services and an increase
of $0.4 million in compensation expense to approximately $3.6 million from $3.2 million in the prior period as a result of an increase
in recognition of stock based compensation related to vested restricted stock units. 

Loss from Operations   

We reported loss from operations of $3.6 million
and $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We reported loss from operations of $10.0
million and $14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decreases in operating loss
were due primarily to the decreases in operating expenses described above. 

Other Income (Expenses)   

Total other income (expense) was approximately
($280) and ($440) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total other income (expense) was approximately
($4,200) and ($1,300) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in other income (expense)
is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense. 

Net Loss   

As a result of the operating expense and other
income (expense) discussed above, we reported a net loss of approximately ($3.6) million for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to a net loss of ($5.9) million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We reported a net loss of ($10.0)
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of ($14.1) million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents
totaled $9.7 million. Our cash and cash equivalents increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by $6.5 million from
our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2015 of $3.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily
the result of cash provided by financing activities of approximately $13.2 million in connection with the proceeds received from
private placements. The increase was partly offset by cash used in operations of $6.7 million that was comprised of exploration
expenditures, primarily at the Relief Canyon mine focused on increasing and upgrading our current estimate of mineralized material,
and general and administrative expenses, including consultant fees, compensation costs, legal fees and public company expenses. 

We plan the following expenditures for the
remainder of fiscal year 2016: 

$1.5 million on general and administrative expenses (including employee salaries, public company expenses, consultants, land holding costs and annual insurance premium renewals);   

$1.2 million on additional work at the Relief Canyon Mine including our 2016 drilling program, further metallurgy tests, geographic surveys and certain pre-feasibility level studies; and   

$0.2 million on additional permitting and bonding, including an environmental assessment to expand the open-pit mines at the Relief Canyon mine property above the water table and the continuation of studies for expansion below the water table.   

The actual amount we spend for year 2016 may
vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend upon several factors, including the results of our geographic
surveys, progress of the additional pre-feasibility studies and work to develop an economically feasible mining and processing
plan, and the timing of obtaining the necessary permitting approvals. We expect to require additional financing to fund operations
in early 2018. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest
  Imputation of Interest  (Subtopic 835-30) which focuses on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The
amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet
as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement
guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The ASU is effective for periods beginning
after December 15, 2015 for public companies. Our adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated
results of operations, financial position and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ), which requires entities to present deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the current guidance
in ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes , which requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities
as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period. We do not expect the impact of ASU 2015-17 to be material on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases  (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance
or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification
will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater
than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing
guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within those annual periods and is applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process
of assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ) as part of FASB's simplification initiative focused on improving
areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity may be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed
within the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 focuses on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions,
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will evaluate the effect of ASU 2016-09 for future periods. 

In August 2016,
FASB issued ASU 2016-15 ,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ).   ASU
2016-15 addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon
debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest
rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies);
distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable
cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The
Company does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. 

Management believes the following critical
accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and present the financial statements of the Company and our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. 

Use of Estimates   

In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date
of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly
from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the useful life of property
and equipment, amounts and timing of closure obligations, the assumptions used to calculate fair value of restricted stock units,
options and warrants granted, stock-based compensation, beneficial conversion on preferred stock, capitalized mineral rights,
asset valuations, timing of the performance criteria of restricted stock units and the fair value of common stock issued. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based
on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost
of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director
is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement
of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined
at the  measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date
is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. 

Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment are carried at cost.
The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are
retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in income in the year of disposition. We examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events
or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, generally from one to twenty five years. 

Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration
Costs   

Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining
unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company has chosen to expense all mineral exploration costs as
incurred given that it is still in the exploration stage. Once the Company has identified proven and probable reserves in its investigation
of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future
costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized,
using the units-of-production method over proven and probable reserves. When the Company has capitalized mineral properties, these
properties will be periodically assessed for impairment of value and any diminution in value. To date, the Company has not established
the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all costs are being expensed. 

ASC 930-805 states that mineral rights consist
of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include
mineral rights. Acquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 805. ASC 805 requires that mineral rights be recognized
at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a result, our direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as
tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims and mill sites. If
proven and probable reserves are established for the property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically
developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over proven and probable reserves. For mineral rights in
which proven and probable reserves have not yet been established, we assess the carrying values for impairment at the end of each
reporting period and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

Long-Lived Assets   

We review for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, pursuant to guidance established in ASC 360-10-35-15,
 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . An impairment is considered to exist when the sum of expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between
the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying amount. 

Asset Retirement Obligations   

Asset retirement obligations, consisting primarily
of estimated mine reclamation and closure costs at the Company s Relief Canyon property, are recognized in the period incurred
and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially estimated
based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to accretion expense. Corresponding
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset s remaining useful life. Asset retirement obligations are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated
present value resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. We review and evaluate
the asset retirement obligations annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed necessary. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Since our inception, we have not engaged in
any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. 

Contractual Obligations  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 3    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

As a   smaller reporting company  
as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company is not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4    Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain  disclosure controls and
procedures,  as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Finance, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of
any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

With respect to the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s management
has concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Controls   

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
