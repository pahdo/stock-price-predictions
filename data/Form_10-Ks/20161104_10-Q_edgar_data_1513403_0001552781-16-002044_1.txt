1.          Organization and Nature of Operations 

Gala Global Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 10, 2010. The Company was formed to provide garment tailoring and alteration services.

On May 19, 2014, a change in control of the Company occurred when IDG Ventures Ltd. sold all of its 3,547,000 common shares, representing 60.04% of our issued and outstanding common shares, in a private share purchase transaction to Messrs Haas, Lefevre and Naccarato.

On June 26, 2014, the Company had a change in management when Mr. Robert Frei resigned as President and Director of the Company and Mr. Lefevre was appointed as his successor. Concurrent with the change of management, the Company acquired two 100% owned subsidiary companies, Cannabis Ventures Inc (USA), incorporated on February 27, 2014 in the state of Nevada and Cannabis Ventures Inc. (Canada), incorporated on April 9, 2014 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Neither of these subsidiary companies had traded prior to their acquisition by the Company other than as described below.

The Company, since its change in management effective June 26, 2014, has expanded into the Hemp and Cannabidiol ("CBD") industry. The expansion is focusing on the development, research, and commercialization of products derived from the Hemp and Cannabis plant. The Company  currently is finalizing  its marketing strategy for a new CBD flavored thin-film strip. The film strip delivery system uses a dissolving film strip that is absorbed in the mouth. The film-strip method is an advanced method of providing CBD for dietary supplement. The Company also is seeking acquisition candidates in this area of interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. The Company also plans to enter into the medical marijuana cultivation industry as approved in the United States and Canada to build legalized cultivation operations. 

The Company's services include the development of cannabinoid based health and wellness products; the development of medical grade compounds; the licensing of proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal herb industry.

Going Concern 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at August 31, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $423,629 and an accumulated deficit of $1,212,234. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company's future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2. 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

a)

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial  statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP") and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company's fiscal year end is November 30. 

b)

Principles of Consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cannabis Ventures Inc. (USA), Cannabis Ventures Inc. (Canada), and CBD Life, Inc, from the date of their acquisition by the Company effective June 26, 2014. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation . 

2. 
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 

c)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, share-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

d)

Interim Financial Statements

The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In management's opinion the financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. Operating results for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended November 30, 2016. For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2015 included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

e)

Inventory

Inven tory is comprised of Vape Mods and cannabidiol products purchased for resale, and is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions.

f)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, there were no cash equivalents.

g)

Financial Instruments

Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable to related parties, loan payable, and amounts due to related parties. The recorded values of all these financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of the short term nature of these financial instruments.

2.         Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 

h)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

i)

Revenue Recognition

The Company earns revenue from the sale of Vape Mods, which are modified electronic cigarettes and vape pens. Revenue will be recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been provided, and collectability is assured.  The Company is not exposed to any credit risks as amounts are prepaid prior to performance of services.

j)

Stock-based Compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.

k)

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share

The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued and outstanding during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

l)

Reclassification

Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation

m)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Cash Flows

Operating Expenses

The Company entered into a lease for a new facility during the three months ended August 31, 2016 resulting in $22,500 of rent expense.

Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 

During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Company incurred operating expenses of $144,604 compared with $563,619 during the nine months ended August 31, 2015. The Company reduced consulting expense by $220,900 during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2015 due to the Company focusing on the commercialization of products derived from the Hemp and Cannabis plant.

Net Loss

During the three months August 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $49,792 and a net loss per share of $0.00 compared with a net loss of $207,675 and a net loss per share of $0.00 for the three months ended August 31, 2015 due to the factors discussed above.

During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $145,697 and a net loss per share of $0.00 compared with a net loss of $563,736 and a net loss per share of $0.00 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 due to the factors discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of August 31, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $423,629, and an accumulated deficit of $1,212,234. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company's future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Cash flow from Operating Activities

During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Company used $60,757 of cash in operating activities compared to the use of $113,342 of cash for operating activities during the nine months ended August 31, 2015 for a decrease of $52,585 in cash used in operating activities. The decrease in cash used for operating activities is due to a decrease in the overall operating activity of the Company compared to prior year.

Cash flow from Investing Activities

During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Company used $nil of cash for investing activities compared with $7,182 during the nine months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease in the use of cash is due to the fact that the Company had advanced $12,467 to an unrelated party during the nine month period ended August 31, 2015. The Company received a repayment of $5,285, and deemed the remaining balance to be uncollectible. Consequently, the Company recognized bad debt of $7,182 on the loan receivable for uncollectible principal and interest.

Cash flow from Financing Activities

During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the Company received $60,964 of cash from financing activities compared with $120,524 during the nine months ended August 31, 2015.  During the current period, the Company received $65,000 as loans from unrelated parties and $2,064 in loans from related parties, offset by $6,100 paid to a related party for amounts owed. During the prior period, the Company repaid $5,000 to a related party and received $120,524 in advances from related parties, which included $42,000 from a note payable issued to a related party.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Subsequent Events

On September 21, 2016, the Company issued a $10,000 promissory note to an unrelated party. Under the terms of the note, the amount due is unsecured, bears interest at 3% per annum, and is due 180 days from the date of issuance  . 

Going Concern

We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.

Future Financings

We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and activities.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes for the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the valuation of its mineral leases and claims and our ability to obtain final government permission to complete the project.

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Our Internal control over financial reporting is a process that, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, was designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our trustees; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As management, it is our responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.  As of August 31, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").  Based on our evaluation, we concluded that the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management's report was not subject to attestation by the company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Based upon the evaluation of these controls and procedures, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the date of filing this annual report applicable for the period covered by this report.
