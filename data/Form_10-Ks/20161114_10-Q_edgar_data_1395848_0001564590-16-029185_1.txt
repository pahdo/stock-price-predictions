 Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Organization and Nature of Operations. 
 Adesto Technologies Corporation (together with its subsidiaries;  Adesto ,  we ,  our ,  us  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the state of California in January 2006 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 2015. We are a leading provider of application-specific and ultra-low power non-volatile memory ( NVM ) products. Our corporate headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California. 
 On September 28, 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation and our financial results include the operating results of those assets from the date of acquisition. 
 The Company completed its initial public offering ( IPO ) of common stock on October 30, 2015. The Company sold 5,192,184 shares, including 192,184 shares for the underwriters  option to purchase additional shares. The shares were sold at an initial public offering price of $5.00 per share for net proceeds of $22.1 million to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 Basis of Presentation. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP to complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company and its results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, for any other interim period or for any other future year.  
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of our operations, and the operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies described in  Note 1,   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our  Annual Report on Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015  that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, except as described below. 
 Reverse Stock Split. 
 On October 1, 2015, we effected a 1-for-33 reverse stock split of our common stock and convertible preferred stock (collectively,  Capital Stock ). On the effective date of the reverse stock split, (i) each 33 shares of outstanding Capital Stock were reduced to one share of Capital Stock; (ii) the number of shares of Capital Stock into which each outstanding warrant or option to purchase Capital Stock is exercisable were proportionately reduced on a 33-to-1 basis; (iii) the exercise price of each outstanding warrant or option to purchase Capital Stock were proportionately increased on a 1-to-33 basis; and (iv) each 33 shares of authorized Capital Stock were reduced to one share of Capital Stock. All of the share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for-33 reverse stock split. The par value of the common stock and convertible preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. 
 Use of Estimates. 
   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate those estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful  
 7 
 
 Adesto Technologies Corporation 
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited) 
   
  accou  nts, reserves for sales, warranty accrual, inventory write-downs, valuation of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, loss on purchase commitments, valuation of deferred taxes and contingencies.   In addition, we use assumptions when employing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted. We base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on vario  us other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
 Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Allowances. 
 We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price is fixed or determinable, transfer of title occurs, and the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Due to the historical immaterial level of product returns under warranty, we do not record a reserve for estimated returns under warranty at the time of revenue recognition. 
 Generally, we meet product sale revenue recognition conditions upon shipment because, in most cases, title and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time. In addition, we estimate and record provisions for future returns and other charges against revenue at the time of shipment, consistent with the terms of sale. We sell products to distributors at the price listed in our distributor price book. At the time of sale, we record a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ( SSDs ), stock rotation rights and any special programs approved by management. We offset the sales reserve against recorded revenues, producing the revenue amount reported in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 The market price for our products can differ significantly from the book price at which we sold the product to the distributor. When the market price of a particular distributor s sales opportunity to their customers would result in low or negative margins for the distributor, as compared to our original book price, we negotiate SSDs with the distributor. Management analyzes our SSD history to develop current SSD rates that form the basis of the SSD revenue reserve recorded each period. We obtain the historical SSD rates from the distributor s records and our internal records. 
 We typically grant payment terms of between 30 and 60 days to our customers. Our customers generally pay within those terms. Distributors are invoiced for shipments at listed book price. When the distributors pay the invoice, they may claim debits for SSDs previously authorized by us when appropriate. Once claimed, we process the requests against prior authorizations and adjust reserves previously established for that customer. 
 The revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs. Determining net revenue requires significant judgments and estimates on our part. We base our estimates on historical experience rates, the levels of inventory held by our distributors, current trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is a risk actual amounts may differ materially from our estimates. Our consolidated financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates. We believe that such estimates are reasonable. 
 We also monitor collectibility of accounts receivable primarily through review of our accounts receivable aging. When facts and circumstances indicate the collection of specific amounts or from specific customers is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is made. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts. 
 Shipping Costs. 
 We charge shipping costs to cost of revenue as incurred. 
 Product Warranty. 
 Our products are sold with a limited warranty for a period of one year, warranting that the product conforms to specifications and is free from material defects in design, materials and workmanship. To date, we have had insignificant returns of any defective production parts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $250,000 for a specific potential warranty claim. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $41,000 has been incurred relating to this potential warranty claim. As of September 30, 2016, the warranty accrual was $209,000.

    Income Taxes.  
 We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets as necessary when in management s estimate, based on available objective evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that based on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. 
 Foreign Currency Translation. 
 The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. In consolidation, we translate assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expense accounts at the average exchange rates during the period in which the transaction takes place. Net gains or losses from foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities were a loss of $19,000  and a gain of $45,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net gains or losses from foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities were a loss of $36,000  and a loss of $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, a component of stockholders  equity. Net gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency were a loss of $18,000 and a loss of $20,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency were a loss of $29,000 and a loss of $20,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. 
 We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain such funds in overnight cash deposits. 
 Property and Equipment. 
 Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the related lease, whichever is shorter. Estimates of useful lives are as follows: 

Estimated useful lives  

Machinery and equipment  

2-5 years  

Furniture and fixtures  

3 years  

Leasehold improvements  

Shorter of lease term or 5 years  

Computer software  

3 years  

Inventories. 
 We record inventories at the lower of standard cost (which generally approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value. On a quarterly basis, we analyze inventories on a part-by-part basis. The carrying value of inventory is adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age, shipment history and the forecast of demand over a specific future period. At the point of loss recognition, a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that new cost basis. The semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from forecast or other assumptions, potentially affecting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory which could have a material effect on our results of operations. 
 Long-Lived Assets. 
   We evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset. If impairment is indicated, we write the

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited) 
   
  asset down to its estimated fair value. For all periods presented, we have not recognized any impairment losses on our long-lived assets.  
 Purchased Intangible Assets. 
 Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets with definite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: 

Years  

Developed technology  

10  

Customer relationships  

12  

Customer backlog  

1  

Non-compete agreement  

5  

Goodwill. 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. 
 We evaluate our goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 1 of each year.  We last conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no goodwill impairment was indicated. 
 When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may initially perform a qualitative assessment which includes a review and analysis of certain quantitative factors to estimate if a reporting unit s fair value significantly exceeds its carrying value. When the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value appears more likely than not to be less than its carrying value based on this qualitative assessment, we continue to the first step of two steps impairment test. The first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base these fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference between the fair values of the reporting unit s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit, and, if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded. In the event that we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired, we record a charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made. We operate in one reporting unit.   
 Research and Development Expenses. 
 Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. 
 Stock-based Compensation. 
   We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. We determine fair value for stock options awarded to employees at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make various assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected future share price volatility and expected term. We determine the fair value of stock options awarded to non-employees at each vesting date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and re-measure fair value at each reporting period until the services required under the arrangement are completed. Fair value is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock-based awards expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate  
 10 
 
 Adesto Technologies Corporation 
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited) 
   
  based on historical experience of our stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. If the actual forfeiture rat  e is materially different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense in future periods could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period.  
   
 Concentration of Risk. 
 Our products are primarily manufactured, assembled and tested by third-party foundries and other contractors in Asia and we are heavily dependent on a single foundry in Taiwan for the manufacture of wafers and a single contractor in the Philippines for assembly and testing of our products. We do not have long-term agreements with either of these suppliers. A significant disruption in the operations of these parties would adversely impact the production of our products for a substantial period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. We place substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents on deposit with a reputable, high credit quality financial institution in the United States of America. We believe that the bank that holds substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents is financially sound and, accordingly, subject to minimal credit risk. Deposits held with the bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. 
 We generally do not require collateral or other security in support of accounts receivable. We periodically review the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay. As a result of our favorable collection experience and customer concentration, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 Customer concentrations as a percentage of revenue were as follows: 

Customer concentrations as a percentage of gross accounts receivable were as follows: 

Net Loss per Share. 
   Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period  
 11 
 
 Adesto Technologies Corporation 
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited) 
   
  determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, common stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants are considered to be potentially dilutive securities  .  
 Loss Contingencies. 
 We are or have been subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We evaluate contingent liabilities, including threatened or pending litigation, for potential losses. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based upon the best information available. For potential losses for which there is a reasonable possibility (meaning the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable) that a loss exists, we will disclose an estimate of the potential loss or range of such potential loss or include a statement that an estimate of the potential loss cannot be made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates, which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements. 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, creating ASC Topic 606. Upon adoption, this topic supersedes the existing guidance under ASC 605 and aims to simplify the number of requirements to follow for revenue recognition and make revenue recognition more comparable across various entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. There are five core principles: 1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 3. Determine the transaction price. 4. Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. 5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Additional considerations under this update include: accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. We plan to adopt this guidance effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), or the first quarter of 2018, and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and provide guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance on our consolidated financial statements with no effect in the first quarter of 2016. 
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, amending ASC 330. Upon adoption, this topic supersedes the existing guidance under ASC 330 and aims to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory. Currently, inventory can be measured at the lower of cost or market, which could result in several potential outcomes, as market could be replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The major amendments would be as follows: 1. Inventory should be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 2. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. 3. The amendment does not apply to inventory measured under LIFO or the retail inventory method. 4. The amendment does apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory measured via FIFO or average cost. We plan to adopt this guidance effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years), or the first quarter of 2017, and do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, Topic 842. This ASU requires lease assets and lease liabilities arising from leases, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU 2016-02 will become effective for us on January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, ASC Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Under this ASU, several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are

  simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. We pl  an to adopt this guidance effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), or the first quarter of 2017, and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606. The ASU, among other things: (1) clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permits an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specifies that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4)  provides a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. We plan to adopt this guidance effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), or the first quarter of 2018, and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, ASC Topic 230.  This ASU is a clarification of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  This update provides guidance on eight identified issues: 1) debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt, 3) contingent consideration for payments, 4) proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, 5) proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, 6) distributions from equity method investees, 7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and 8) separately identifiable cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.  An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.

 14

  measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting peri  od using a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowe  st level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:  
 Level 1.  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2 .  Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices which are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.  
 Level 3.  Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and which are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
 Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Note 5. Borrowings. 
 Bridge Bank Loan. 
 In October 2013, we entered into the Business Financing Agreement (the  BFA ) with Bridge Bank N.A. The BFA consisted of both a revolving credit facility under which we were permitted to borrow up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable but not to exceed $7.5 million and a term loan in the amount of $9.0 million. Interest on the revolving credit facility accrued at the bank s prime rate, which under the BFA could not have been less than 3.25%, plus 1.25% while interest on the term loan accrues at the bank s prime rate plus 3%. Under the term loan, we were required to make interest only payments through April 2014 and principal payments of $300,000 monthly thereafter plus interest. Borrowings under the BFA were collateralized by all of our assets and were subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining minimum levels of EBITDA on a quarterly basis and a certain minimum asset coverage ratio based on the ratio of unrestricted cash plus certain accounts receivable to total outstanding under the agreement. 
 In October 2014, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants. As a result, in October 2014, we entered into the First Business Financing Modification Agreement (the  BFA Modification ) under which the covenant defaults were waived. The BFA Modification (i) increased the interest rate charged on the term loan from the bank s prime rate plus 3% to the bank s prime rate plus 4% and would have declined to the bank s prime rate plus 3% upon the raising of additional equity of not less than $2.5 million, (ii) required us to continue to maintain certain minimum levels of EBITDA and asset coverage ratios, (iii) required us to maintain unrestricted cash of not less than $4.25 million until that point at which we either receive additional equity of not less than $5.0 million or maintain a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 (based on the ratio of EBITDA to current portion of total amounts outstanding under the BFA Modification plus period-to-date interest expense payments) for two consecutive quarters.

    In addition, under the BFA the bank was paid a facility fee of $82,500 at closing. Under the BFA Modification, the bank was paid an additional facility fee of $50,000 and received a warrant to purchase 1,488 shares of our Series   E convertible preferred stock. The facility fees and the value of the warrant, $0.1 million, were recorded as a debt discount and have been amortized over the life of the agreement. Amortization of debt discount was $0.1 million in 2015.     
  Borrowings of $10.9 million under this facility were repaid in full in April 2015. 
 Opus Bank Term Loan. 
 In April 2015, we entered into a three-year $15.0 million credit agreement, or the term loan facility. The agreement provided for a senior secured term loan facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital, to repay certain indebtedness and for capital expenditures and other expenses. Interest accrued on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to (a) the higher of (i) the prime rate (as publicly announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal) and (ii) 3.25% plus (b) (i) 1.00% if our cash equivalents are greater than 125% of the outstanding principal of our borrowings under the term loan facility, or (ii) 2.00% if our cash and cash equivalents are less than or equal to 125% of such borrowings. Indebtedness we incurred under this agreement was collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the agreement contained financial covenants requiring us to maintain a monthly asset coverage ratio after September 30, 2015 of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, and quarterly adjusted EBITDA (measured on a trailing three-month basis) of $1 through September 30, 2016 and increasing to higher levels thereafter. Under the agreement, the quarterly EBITDA covenant was not applicable if the asset coverage ratio is met at all times during any particular quarter. The agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets, merge or consolidate and make acquisitions. Upon an occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to pay interest on all outstanding obligations under the agreement at a rate of 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate, and the lender may accelerate our obligations under the agreement.    
 Borrowings of $14.0 million under this facility were repaid in full in July, 2016. 
 In connection with the term loan facility, Opus Bank received a warrant to purchase 31,897 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock. Upon the completion of our IPO on October 30, 2015 the preferred stock warrants were converted into 315,282 of our common stock warrants. In addition, we paid financing costs of $0.1 million. The financing costs and the value of the warrant, $0.9 million, were recorded as a debt discount and were being amortized over the life of the agreement. Amortization of debt discount was $0.2 million for the six months ended in June 30, 2016. In connection with the repayment of this facility, the remaining unamortized debt discount of $0.4 million was recorded as interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.      
 Bridge Bank Term Loan 
 On July 7, 2016, the Company entered into a business financing agreement ( Credit Facility ) with Bridge Bank N.A. The Credit Facility provides for (i) a term loan of up to $18.0 million and (ii) a revolving credit line advance in the aggregate amount of the lower of (x) $2.0 million and (y) 80% of certain of the Company s receivables. The term loan made pursuant to the Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the prime rate or 3.5%, plus 0.75%, and matures in June 2019.  The line of credit bears interest at a rate per annual equal to the greater of the prime rate or 3.5% plus 0.50%, and matures in July 2018.The Company will make interest-only payments on the term loan from July 2016 through September 2016 and will make interest payments and principal payments in 33 equal monthly installments starting October 2016. Indebtedness we incur under this agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company and any domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Company paid a facility fee of $150,000 upon entry into the Credit Facility and an additional $10,000 is due on July 7, 2017 as well as $25,000 diligence fee. These fees have been recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized over the life of the agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discount was $26,000 and the unamortized debt discount was $149,000 as of September 30, 2016.      
   
 The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Among other negative covenants, the Company may not permit the ratio of the balance of unrestricted cash deposited at the financial institution to the total amounts owed with respect to the term loan to be less than 1.15 to 1.00. Upon an occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to pay interest on all outstanding obligations under the agreement at a rate of 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate, and the lender may accelerate our obligations under the agreement. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions.

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies. 
 Operating Leases. 
 On November 2, 2015, the Company extended the lease for its former headquarters by six months to July 2016 by entering into that certain Amendment to Commercial Sublease, ( Amendment ) dated November 2, 2015, between the Company and eGain Corporation. The Amendment provides for a base rent during the extension period of $47,087 per month. Subsequently, we extended the lease to August 31, 2016. 
 Additionally, on November 2, 2015, the Company entered into a lease with Peterson Ridge LLC pursuant to which the Company has leased a new headquarters facility, consisting of an aggregate of approximately 34,000 square feet of space in Santa Clara, California. The initial term of the lease commenced on November 2, 2015 and is scheduled to end on July 31, 2023 and may be extended, at the Company s option, for an additional five-year period following the initial lease term. 
 Pursuant to the lease, monthly base rental payments due under the lease are approximately $93,000 per month between August 1, 2016 and February 27, 2017, with annual increases of approximately 3% thereafter. The Company must also pay for certain other operating costs under the lease, including operating expenses, taxes, assessments, insurance, utilities, securities and property management fees. Peterson Ridge LLC is obligated to reimburse the Company for up to $2,521,051 of the Company s out-of-pocket costs associated with any tenant improvements, as defined in the lease. The Company was reimbursed for this amount during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Rent expense under operating leases was $0.4 million and $1.5 million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

    Purchase   Commitments.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had purchase commitments with our third-party foundries of $1.5 million due within one year, $0.9 million for a licensing and development agreement, and $8.3 million in conjunction with an agreement with TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Company. 
 Litigation. 
 We may be subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation, including intellectual property litigation, arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes and are not predictable with assurance. We accrue amounts that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss that is reasonably estimable. 
 Indemnification. 
 During the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees which may include intellectual property indemnities to certain of our customers in connection with the sales of our products and indemnities for liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties  technology based upon our products. Our exposure under these indemnification provisions is generally limited to the total amount paid by a customer under the agreement. However, certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement. In addition, we indemnify our officers, directors and certain key employees while they are serving in good faith in such capacities. 
 We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Where necessary, we accrue for losses for any known contingent liabilities, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable. 

Note 8. Common Stock, Common Stock Warrants and Stock Option Plan. 
 Common Stock. 
 We are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.0001 par value per share.  Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends, when and if declared by our Board of Directors. 
 Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance. 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had reserved shares of common stock for future issuances as follows:

    Common Stock Warrants.  
 The following common stock warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and were the result of a conversion of preferred stock warrants upon the completion of our IPO on October 30, 2015. 

Common stock warrants are exercisable at the option of the holder any time after the date of issuance into shares of our common stock. The aggregate amount of shares of common stock that would be issued is determined by dividing the exercisable price by the conversion price applicable on the date of conversion multiplied by the number of warrants exercised.  
 Employee Benefit Plans 
 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. 
 In 2007, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ) under which 272,727 shares of common stock were reserved and available for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock to eligible participants. The 2007 Plan was subsequently amended to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan to 787,878 and during the year ended December 31, 2015, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan was increased to 2,651,515. Options and restricted stock awards were granted at a price per share not less than the 85% of the fair value at the date of grant or award, respectively. Restricted stock awarded to persons controlling more than 10% of our stock were granted at a price per share not less than the 100% of the fair value at the date of the award. Options that were granted to new employees generally vest over a four-year period with 25% vesting at the end of one year and the remaining to vest monthly thereafter, while options that were granted to existing employees generally vest over a four-year period. Options granted generally are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant. As of October 26, 2015, no shares were available for grant under the 2007 Plan and all outstanding options continue to be governed and remain outstanding in accordance with their existing terms under the 2007 Plan. In addition, any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan that are issuable upon the exercise of options that expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full will be available for future grant and issuance under the 2015 Plan (as defined below). 
 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 
 In September 2015, our Board of Directors adopted, and in October 2015 our stockholders approved, our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan became effective on the date immediately prior to the date of our initial public offering. As a result, 1,813,272 shares of common stock previously reserved but unissued under the 2007 Plan on the effective date of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan became reserved for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and we ceased granting awards under our 2007 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will increase automatically on the first day of January of each of 2016 through 2025 by the number of shares equal to 4% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31. However, our Board of Directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. 
 Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the award of stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units ( RSU s ), performance awards and stock bonuses. No person will be eligible to receive more than 2,000,000 shares in any calendar year under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan other than a new employee of ours, who will be eligible to receive no more than 4,000,000 shares under the plan in the calendar year in which the employee commences employment. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single non-employee director pursuant to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan in any calendar year shall not exceed 300,000. Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides that no more than 25,000,000 shares will be issued as incentive stock options.

    2015 Employee Stock Purcha  se Plan  
 In September 2015, our Board of Directors adopted, and in October 2015 our stockholders approved, our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ). The 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan became effective on the date of our initial public offering. We reserved 150,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will increase automatically on the first day of January following the first offering date by the number of shares equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31 (rounded to the nearest whole share). However, our Board of Directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not exceed 2,250,000 shares of our common stock. 
 Under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees will be able to acquire shares of our common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions. Eligible employees will be able to select a rate of payroll deduction up to 15% of their base cash compensation. The purchase price for shares of our common stock purchased under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on (i) the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (ii) the last trading day of each purchase period in the applicable offering period. Except for the first offering period, each offering period will run for no more than six months, with purchases occurring every six months. The first offering period began upon the effective date of our IPO and was originally set to end on June 30, 2016. On May 25, 2016, the Board of Directors extended the initial offering period to July 31, 2016. Subsequent purchase periods will be 6 months in duration beginning on August 1, 2016. On July 29, 2016, we issued 68,392 shares of common stock in conjunction with the end date of the initial purchase window. 
 No participant will have the right to purchase shares of our common stock in an amount that has a fair market value greater than $25,000, determined as of the first day of the applicable purchase period, for each calendar year in which that right is outstanding. In addition, no participant will be permitted to purchase more than 2,500 shares during any one purchase period or a lesser amount as determined by our compensation committee. 
 Our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will continue until the earlier to occur of its termination by our Board of Directors, the issuance of all shares reserved for issuance under it or the tenth anniversary of its effective date. 
 A summary of stock option and restricted stock units activity under the 2007 Plan and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is as follows:

Note 9. Stock-based Compensation. 
 We record stock-based compensation for stock options based on fair value as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units equals the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. We recognize such costs as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee s requisite service period, which is generally four years. Our valuation assumptions are as follows: 
 Fair value of common stock.  Prior to our IPO in October 2015, we estimated the fair value of our common stock using various valuation methodologies, including valuation analyses performed by third-party valuation firms. After the initial public offering, we used the publicly quoted price as the fair value of our common stock.  
 Risk-free interest rate.  We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent expected term of the options for each option group.  
 Expected term.  The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumption is based on the simplified method in which the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award s weighted-average vesting period and its contractual term. We expect to continue using the simplified method until sufficient information about historical behavior is available.  
 Volatility.  We determine volatility based on the historical stock volatilities of a group of publicly listed guideline companies over a period equal to the expected terms of the options, as we do not have sufficient trading history to determine the volatility of our common stock.  
 Dividend yield.  We have never declared or paid any cash dividend and do not currently plan to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.

    The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine f  air value of stock options:  

We did not grant any stock options during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We granted 217,900 stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We granted 55,454 and 201,185 stock options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
   
 The following table presents the effects of stock-based compensation for stock options, RSU s and ESPP shares during the periods (in thousands): 

Stock-based compensation expense capitalized to inventories was not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 We did not realize any income tax benefit from stock option exercises in any of the periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $0.6 million, and this amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU s and ESPP was $3.0 million and $58,000, respectively, and these amounts are expected to be recognized over 1.2 years and 0.3 years, respectively. 
   
 Note 10. Income Taxes. 
 We recorded an income tax provision of $15,000 and $5,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded an income tax provision of $46,000 and $76,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax provision is comprised of estimates of current taxes due in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision reflects tax expense associated with state income tax, foreign taxes, uncertain tax positions and tax expense related to the recording of a deferred tax liability that results from the amortization for income tax purposes of acquisition-related goodwill. The decrease in the tax provision between 2016 and 2015   is primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes and deferred tax expense associated with our deferred tax liability. 
   As of September 30, 2016, our deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance except in those jurisdictions where it is determined that a valuation allowance is not required. Accounting for income taxes provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not. Based on the weight of available evidence, which includes historical operating

  performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we provided a full valuation allowance agai  nst our net U.S. deferred tax assets. We reassess the need for our valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. If it is later determined that a portion or all of the valuation allowance is not required, it generally will be a benefit to the income tax provis  ion in the period that such determination is made.  
 We evaluate tax positions for recognition using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for our income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. We do not anticipate a material change in the total amount or composition of its unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of September 30, 2016. 
 We file tax returns in the United States for federal, California, and other states. All tax years remain open to examination for both federal and state purposes as a result of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards. We file foreign tax returns in the United Kingdom, France, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. These tax years remain open to examination, except for 2011 and prior years in France.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
 The discussion below contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to safe harbors under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or to our future financial or operating performance. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as  may,   might,   will,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   could,   intend,   target,   projects,   contemplates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events occurring or circumstances arising after the date of this report. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements on the basis of several factors, including those that we discuss in Risk Factors, set forth in Part II, Item 1A, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We encourage you to read that section carefully. 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In this Quarterly Report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires,  Adesto,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Adesto Technologies Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of application-specific and ultra-low power non-volatile memory, or NVM, products. We optimize our NVM products for Internet of Things, or IoT, applications including current and next-generation Internet-connected devices in the consumer, industrial, medical and wearables markets. We combine our NVM design capabilities with proprietary intellectual property and differentiated technology platforms to deliver high-performance products that dramatically reduce the overall energy consumption of our customers  systems and extend battery life. Our products feature embedded intelligence in a small form factor and high reliability. 
 Our revenue is derived from the sale of our NVM products, primarily our standard serial flash memory products, which represented substantially all of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016. On September 28, 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation, or Atmel. The products we acquired as part of the acquisition were approaching the end of their life cycle and experiencing annual revenue declines. While we provide support for these products, we have not invested further in their research and development. Revenue from these legacy products have declined to $0.4 million from $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and we expect no material revenue from these products in the future. Since the acquisition, we have invested in developing new products that are better suited for low-power, high-growth applications, accelerated development of select products and introduced new products based on the acquired technology. In 2013, we introduced the first of our next-generation DataFlash and Fusion Flash products, which have similar functionality to our legacy products, but also offer enhanced features such as ultra-deep power down and wide supply voltage range operation. Revenue from our next-generation NVM products was $11.1 million and $10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $31.3 million and $28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had been exclusively developing products based on Conductive Bridging RAM, or CBRAM, technology prior to the acquisition of assets from Atmel. Since then, we have continued to invest our resources into developing and enhancing our families of CBRAM-based products, although revenue associated with these products has not been material to date. We have made and continue to make these upfront investments because we believe that the introduction of any fundamentally new semiconductor technology must necessarily go through a lengthy customer evaluation process and several cycles of improvement in the field before it can be widely adopted or generate material revenue. 
   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our products were sold to approximately 400 end customers. In general, we work directly with our customers to have our NVM devices designed into and qualified for their products. Although we maintain direct sales, support and development relationships with our customers, once our products are designed into a customer s product, we sell a majority of our products to those customers through distributors. We generated 66% and 68% of our revenue from distributors during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 69% and 67% of our revenue from distributors during  
 26 

the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to three distributors generated approximately 32% and 2  5% of our revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 37% and 25% of our revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, we derived approximately 83% and 79% of our reve  nue internationally during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and 85% and 80% of our revenue internationally during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the majority of which was recognized in the A  sia Pacific, or APAC, region. Revenue by geography is recognized based on the region to which our products are sold, and not to where the end products are shipped. Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California, with additional sales operations in   North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and APAC regions. We recorded revenue of $11.2 million and $11.1 million, and net losses of $4.1 million and $1.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an  d $31.6 million and $31.4 million, and net losses of $9.9 million and $5.1 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Product adoption in new markets and applications.  We optimize our products to meet the technical requirements of the emerging IoT market. The growth in the IoT market is dependent on many factors, most of which are outside of our control. Should the IoT market not develop or develop more slowly, our financial results could be adversely affected.  
 Ability to attract and retain customers that make large orders.  In 2015, our products were sold to approximately 500 end customers, of which approximately 20 generated more than half our revenue. One end customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in 2015. While we expect the composition of our customers to change over time, our business and operating results will depend on our ability to continually target new and retain existing customers that make large orders, particularly those in growth markets which are less dependent on macroeconomic conditions.  
 Design wins with new and existing customers.  We believe our solutions significantly improve the performance and potentially lower the system cost of our customers  designs, particularly if we are part of the early design phase. Accordingly, we work closely with our customers and targeted prospects to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success. We define a design win as the successful completion of the evaluation stage, where a customer has tested our product, verified that our product meets its requirements, qualified our NVM device for their products and placed an order for the purchase of our products. The number of our design wins has grown from 32 in 2013 to 65 in 2014 and to 135 in 2015, including 6, 63, and 125 design wins for new products, respectively. We had more than 150 new design wins during the first nine months of 2016. The revenue that we generate, if any, from each design win can vary significantly. Our long-term sales expectations are based on forecasts from customers, internal estimates of customer demand factoring in expected time to market for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential and internal estimates of overall demand based on historical trends.  
 Pricing, product cost and gross margins of our products.  Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of changes in pricing, shipment volumes, new product introductions, changes in product mixes, changes in our purchase price of fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs, manufacturing yields and inventory write downs, if any. In general, newly introduced products and products with higher performance and more features tend to be priced higher than older, more mature products. Average selling prices in the semiconductor industry typically decline as products mature. Consistent with this historical trend, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline as they mature. In the normal course of business, we will seek to offset the effect of declining average selling prices on existing products by reducing manufacturing costs and introducing new and higher value-added products. If we are unable to maintain overall average selling prices or offset any declines in average selling prices with realized savings on product costs, our gross margin will decline.  
 Investment in growth.  We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in expanding our operations, increasing our headcount, developing our products and differentiated technologies to support our growth and expanding our infrastructure. We expect our total operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future to meet our growth objectives. We plan to continue to invest in our sales and support operations throughout the world, with a particular focus in the near term of adding additional sales and field applications personnel in APAC to further broaden our support and coverage of our existing customer base, in addition to developing new customer relationships and generating design wins. We also intend to continue to invest additional resources in research and development to support the development of our products and differentiated technologies. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization or research and development will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, and the return on these investments may be lower than we expect. In addition, as we invest in expanding our operations internationally, our business and results will become further subject to the risks and challenges of international operations, including higher operating expenses and the impact of legal and regulatory developments outside the United States.

Components of Our Results of Operations  
 Revenue 
 We derive substantially all of our revenue through the sale of our NVM products to OEMs and ODMs, primarily through distributors. We generated 69% and 67% of our revenue from distributors during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We sell the majority of our products to distributors and generally recognize revenue when we ship the product directly to the distributors. 
 Because our distributors market and sell their products worldwide, our revenue by geographic location is not necessarily indicative of where our customers  product sales and design win activity occur, but rather of where their manufacturing operations occur. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party manufacturers for wafer fabrication, assembly and testing of our NVM products, write-downs of inventory for excess and obsolete inventories including write-downs of inventory for products based on CBRAM technology and accruals for future losses on CBRAM wafer purchase commitments to the extent our costs exceed the market price for such products. To a lesser extent, cost of revenue also includes depreciation of test equipment and expenses relating to manufacturing support activities, including personnel-related costs, logistics, and quality assurance and shipping. 
 Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of changes in pricing, shipment volumes, new product introductions, changes in product mixes, changes in our purchase price of fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs, manufacturing yields and inventory write downs, if any. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expense. Personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of each of our operating expense categories. In addition, in the near term we expect to hire additional personnel, primarily in our selling and marketing functions, and increase research and development expenditures, such as prototype wafers, associated with the implementation of our CBRAM technology in a manufacturing facility in Asia. Accordingly, we expect our operating expenses to increase as we invest in these initiatives. 
 Research and Development . Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for the design and development of our products and technologies. Additional research and development expenses include product prototypes, mask costs, external test and characterization expenses, depreciation, amortization of design tool software licenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and allocated overhead expenses. We also incur costs related to outsourced research and development activities. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to improve our product features, increase our portfolio of solutions and implement our CBRAM manufacturing technology in a new manufacturing facility.  
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales, business development, marketing, and applications engineering activities, third-party sales representative commissions, promotional and other marketing expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and travel expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our direct sales teams, primarily in the Asia Pacific Region, and increase our marketing activities.  
 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, consulting expenses and professional fees. Professional fees principally consist of legal, audit, tax and accounting services. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we hire additional personnel, make improvements to our infrastructure and incur significant additional costs for the compliance requirements of operating as a public company, including higher legal, insurance and accounting expenses.  
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
   Other income (expense), net is comprised of interest income (expense) and other income (expense). Interest expense consists of interest on our outstanding debt. Other expense, net consists primarily of the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant  
 28 

liability and foreign exchange gains or losses. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions an  d asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future. 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentage data): 
 Revenue 

Revenue increased by $37,000, or less than 1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in sales of our Fusion Flash products. During the first three months of 2016, we began to see a slowdown in customer orders that we believe is due to reduced consumer demand in our end markets. This slowdown may persist in future periods. 
   
 Revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in sales of our Data Flash and Fusion Flash products offset by reductions in sales of our Standard Flash products. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin 

Cost of revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to a reduction in direct manufacturing costs as a result of a favorable product mix towards our Fusion Flash products. Cost of revenue decreased by $1.8 million, or 10%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to a reduction in direct manufacturing costs. 
 Gross profit increased by $0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to improvements in our cost structure as a result of a favorable product mix and a reduction in direct manufacturing expenses. 
 29 

Gross profit increased by $2.0 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to improvements in our cost structure, favorable product mix, and an increase in sales of our Data Flash and Fusion Flash products.  
 Operating Expenses 

Research and Development . Research and development ( R D ) expense increased by $1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to personnel-related expenses of $0.3 million, an increase in materials and supplies of $0.6 million, an increase of outsourced R D of $0.1 million, and an increase of facilities costs of $0.2 million. R D expense increased by $3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to personnel-related expenses of $1.0 million, an increase in materials, supplies and third party project expenses of $1.0 million, an increase in expenses for outsourced R D activities, which consisted primarily of fees for professional consultants, of $0.5 million, and an increase in facilities expense of $0.7 million.  
 Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expense increased by $0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to personnel-related expenses of $0.6 million and an increase of facilities expense of $0.1 million. Sales and marketing expense increased by $2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to personnel-related expenses of $1.5 million, an increase in travel expenses of $0.1 million, an increase in outside services of $0.1 million, and an increase in facilities expenses of $0.4 million.  
 General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses increased by $0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $0.6 million and facilities expenses of $0.1 million. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to increases in personnel-related expenses of $1.7 million, public company-related costs of $0.3 million, and facilities related expenses of $0.4 million.  
 Gain from settlement with a former foundry supplier.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a non-cash gain of $2.0 million resulting from settlement of a disputed liability with a former foundry supplier. We did not recognize a similar gain or loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Other Income (Expense), Net 

Interest expense, net increased by $0.2 million and $0.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to a write off of unamortized debt discount associated with the repayment in full of our Opus Bank loan.  
   
 30 

Other income (expense), net decreased by $0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due primarily to the recording of a reduction in our liability associated with p  referred stock warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 Other income (expense), net decreased by $0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due primarily to the recording of a reduction in our liability associated with preferred stock warrants along with the settlement with Atmel regarding certain funds held in escrow in connection with serial flash assets purchased from Atmel during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 

Provision for income taxes increased by $10,000 and decreased by $30,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Both the three months and nine months changes are related to our foreign subsidiaries due to a reduction in tax expense related to our foreign subsidiaries and deferred tax expense related to our deferred tax liability. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily with gross proceeds from the sale of an aggregate of $78.5 million of convertible preferred stock, $22.5 million of term debt associated with the acquisition of the certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation, net proceeds from our IPO on October 30, 2015 of $22.1 million and borrowings under our current Credit Facility of $19.9 million. Our principal source of liquidity as of September 30, 2016 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $21.4 million. We did not have any borrowing capacity available under our term loan facility or credit line as of September 30, 2016. Our outstanding borrowings under both facilities as of September 30, 2016 were $20.0 million. Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in the United States. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and our costs to implement new manufacturing technologies. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any additional debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
   Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, investments in research and development and sales and marketing, and inventory procurement. Net cash used in operating activities for the periods presented consisted of net losses adjusted for certain noncash items  
 31 

and changes in working capital. Within changes in working capital, changes in accounts rece  ivable, inventory and accounts payable generally account for the largest adjustments, as we typically use more cash to fund accounts receivable and build inventory as our business grows. Increases in accounts payable typically provides more cash as we do m  ore business with our contract foundries and other third parties, depending on the timing of payments.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating activities was $5.4 million, primarily from a net loss of $9.9 million and the impact of a $2.0 million non-cash gain resulting from a settlement with a former foundry supplier partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.5 million related to stock-based compensation expense, $1.6 million related to depreciation and amortization, $0.6 million related to the amortization of debt discount along with a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.5 million and an increase in account payable and accruals of $0.2 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operating activities was $4.2 million, primarily from a net loss of $5.1 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.2 million partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.1 million primarily related to depreciation and amortization. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to support continued growth of our business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, due to purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements related to our new headquarters facility in Santa Clara, CA. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities primarily include proceeds and payments related to our term loans and our credit facility. 
 During nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $6.1 million due to $17.8 million in net proceeds from a new Bridge Bank term loan, $2.0 million in proceeds from a new Bridge Bank line of credit, $0.2 million from the issuance of common stock offset by the repayment of $14.0 million outstanding on the Opus Bank term loan. 
   
 During nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $4.0 million due to $14.9 million of proceeds from the Opus Bank term loan partially offset by repayments of $10.9 million on the line of credit and term loan held by Bridge Bank. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose. 
 Credit Facility 
   In April 2015, we entered into a three-year $15.0 million credit agreement, or the term loan facility. The agreement provided for a senior secured term loan facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital, to repay certain indebtedness and for capital expenditures and other expenses. Interest accrued on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to (a) the higher of (i) the prime rate (as publicly announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal) and (ii) 3.25% plus (b) (i) 1.00% if our cash and cash equivalents are greater than 125% of the outstanding principal of our borrowings under the term loan facility, or (ii) 2.00% if our cash and cash equivalents are less than or equal to 125% of such borrowings. Indebtedness incurred under this agreement was collateralized by substantially all of our assets and contained financial covenants requiring us to maintain a monthly asset coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, and quarterly adjusted EBITDA (measured on a trailing three-month basis) of $1 through September 30, 2016 and increasing to higher levels thereafter. Under the agreement, the quarterly EBITDA covenant was not applicable if the asset coverage ratio is met at all times during any particular quarter. The agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets, merge or consolidate and make acquisitions. Upon an occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to pay interest on all outstanding obligations under the agreement at a rate of 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate, and the lender may accelerate our obligations under the agreement.  On July 7, 2016, we terminated the term loan facility. In connection with termination and new  
 32 

borrowings under the new Credit Facility (as defined below), we paid off all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest, and fees under the term loan facility  
   
 On July 7, 2016, we entered into a business financing agreement ( Credit Facility ) with a financial institution. The Credit Facility provides for (i) a term loan of up to $18.0 million and (ii) a revolving credit line advance in the aggregate amount of the lower of (x) $2.0 million and (y) 80% of certain of our receivables. The term loan made pursuant to the Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the prime rate and 3.5%, plus 0.75%, and matures in June 2019. The line of credit bears interest at a rate per annual equal to the greater of the prime rate or 3.5% plus 0.50%, and matures in July 2018. We will make interest-only payments on the term loan from July 2016 through September 2016 and will make principal and interest payments in 33 equal monthly installments starting October 2016.  Indebtedness we incur under this agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, subject to certain customary exceptions. We paid a facility fee of $150,000 upon entry into the Credit Facility and an additional $10,000 on July 7, 2017 as well as a $25,000 diligence fee. The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Among other negative covenants, we may not permit the ratio of the balance of unrestricted cash deposited at the financial institution to the total amounts owed with respect to the term loan to be less than 1.15 to 1.00. Upon an occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to pay interest on all outstanding obligations under the agreement at a rate of 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate, and the lender may accelerate our obligations under the agreement. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions.

Item 3.   
 
          Quantitative and Qualitat  ive Disclosures About Market Risk     

 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities as follows: 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States and to a lesser extent in EMEA and APAC. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements. 
 We have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or used any other derivative financial instruments. Although we transact the substantial majority of our business in U.S. dollars, future fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products and thus may impact our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of $21.4 million as of September 30, 2016, consisting of bank deposits and money market funds. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. We also had total outstanding gross debt of $20.0 million offset by an unamortized debt discount of approximately $0.1 million as of September 30, 2016. The outstanding debt relates to a term loan and line of credit. 
 We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. Our exposure to interest rates relates to the change in the amounts of interest we must pay on our variable rate borrowings. A hypothetical 10% increase in our borrowing rates would not have a material impact on interest expense on our principal balances as of September 30, 2016. 

Item 4.   
 
     Controls and Procedures.        

(a)  
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures and determining the existence of a material weakness in such disclosure controls and procedures. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management (with the participation of our CEO and CFO) has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b)  
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting means a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

PART II: OTHE  R INFORMAT  ION  

ITEM 1.   
 
     Legal Proceedings    

 We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. We may, from time to time, become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business and as our business grows, we may become a party to an increasing number of legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A.   
 
     Risk Factors    

 An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks actually occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry 
 We have a history of losses which may continue in the future, and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability. 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception. We incurred net losses of $9.9 million, $8.4 million, $8.9 million, and $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $92.4 million. We expect to incur significant expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including in connection with our efforts to pursue opportunities in emerging IoT markets, develop and improve upon our products and technology, maintain and enhance our research and development and sales and marketing activities and hire additional personnel. Further, revenue may not grow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, many of which are outside our control, including a decline in demand for our products, increased competition, business conditions that adversely affect the semiconductor memory industry, including reduced demand for products in the end markets that we serve, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. 
 We may be unable to match production with customer demand for a variety of reasons including our inability to accurately forecast customer demand or the capacity constraints of contract manufacturers, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 We make planning and spending decisions, including determining production levels, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of product demand and customer requirements. Our products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The short-term nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, necessitate more onerous procurement commitments and reduce our gross margin. If we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase products that we may not be able to sell, which could result in decreases in our prices or write-downs of unsold inventory. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity was unavailable, we would lose sales opportunities and could lose market share or damage our customer relationships. The rapid pace of innovation in our industry could also render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or write-downs of inventory values that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 35 

Our quarterly operating results or other operating metrics may fluctuate significantly, which   could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.  
 Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We expect that this trend will continue as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including: 

the receipt, reduction, delay or cancellation of orders by large customers;     

the gain or loss of significant customers and distributors;     

the timing and success of our launch of new or enhanced products and those of our competitors;     

market acceptance of our products and our customers  products;     

the level of growth or decline in the IoT market;     

the timing and extent of research and development and sales and marketing expenditures;     

the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;     

changes in our product mix;     

our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;     

competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;     

fluctuations in sales by and inventory levels of OEMs and ODMs who incorporate our memory products in their products;     

cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our markets;     

fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third-party contract manufacturers;     

events that impact the availability of production capacity at our third-party subcontractors and other interruptions in the supply chain including due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, materials shortages, bankruptcy or other causes;     

supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers  products;     

the timing of expenses related to the acquisition of technologies or businesses;     

product rates of return or price concessions in excess of those expected or forecasted;     

costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;     

unexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;     

costs associated with litigation over intellectual property rights and other litigation;     

the length and unpredictability of the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers;     

loss of key personnel or the inability to attract qualified engineers; and     

geopolitical events, such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions, or the occurrence of natural disasters.     

 Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. 
 The semiconductor memory industry is highly cyclical and our markets may experience significant cyclical fluctuations in demand as a result of changing economic conditions, budgeting and buying patterns of customers and others factors. As a result of these and other factors affecting demand for our products and our results of operations in any given period, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indicative of our future revenue or operating performance. Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results could also cause our stock price to decline. 
 36 

We rely on third parties to manufacture, package, assemble and test the semiconductor components comprising our products, which exposes us to a number of risks, including reduced control over manufacturing and d  elivery timing and potential exposure to price fluctuations, which could result in a loss of revenue or reduced profitability.  
 As a fabless semiconductor company, we outsource the manufacturing, packaging, assembly and testing of our semiconductor components to third-party foundries and assembly and testing service providers. We use two foundries, United Microelectronics Corporation in Taiwan and XMC in Wuhan, China, for the production of our flash memory products and a single foundry, Altis Semiconductor S.N.C. in France, for our Mavriq and Moneta products. Our primary assembly and testing contractor is Amkor Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines. Our wafer probing is performed by King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. in Taiwan. 
 Relying on third-party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents a number of risks, including but not limited to: 

capacity and materials shortages during periods of high demand;     

reduced control over delivery schedules, inventories and quality;     

the unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;     

the inability to achieve required production or test capacity and acceptable yields on a timely basis;     

misappropriation of our intellectual property;     

the third parties  ability to perform its obligations due to bankruptcy or other financial constraints;     

limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; and     

potential increases in prices.     

 Any of the foregoing risks may affect our ability to meet customer demand. For example, one of our silicon wafer suppliers suddenly declared bankruptcy in December 2013 and abruptly shut down its foundry. As a result, we were unable to fulfill a portion of our customers  orders in 2014 while we transitioned wafer production to a new foundry. Based on the average selling prices then in effect for those wafers, we estimate that the potential loss of revenue exceeded $10.0 million. 
 We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with our third-party contract manufacturers for our DataFlash and Fusion Flash products, including United Microelectronics Corporation and Amkor Technology, Inc. Therefore, they are not obligated to perform services or supply components to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities, or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. During periods of high demand and tight inventories, our third-party foundries and assembly and testing contractors may allocate capacity to the production of other companies  components while reducing deliveries to us, or significantly raise their prices. In particular, they may allocate capacity to other customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long-term agreements, decreasing the capacity available to us. Shortages of capacity available to us may be caused by the actions of their other, large customers that may be difficult to predict, such as major product launches. If we need other foundries or assembly and test contractors because of increased demand, or if we are unable to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers, we might not be able to cost-effectively and quickly retain other vendors to satisfy our requirements. Because the lead-time needed to establish a relationship with a new third-party supplier could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific component. In addition, the time and expense to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense, diversion of resources or lost sales, any of which would negatively impact our financial results. 
 In the event that we expand production of a component to include a new contract manufacturer, as we expect to do with our current and future CBRAM-based products, it may take approximately 18 to 24 months to allow a transition from our current foundry or assembly services provider to the new provider. We may experience difficulty migrating our proprietary CBRAM technology platform and, consequently, may experience reduced yields, delays in component deliveries and increased research and development expense. The inability by us or our third-party manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition our technology to their infrastructure may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find suitable replacements for our third-party contract manufacturers. 
 If any of our current or future foundry partners or assembly and test subcontractors significantly increases the costs of wafers or other materials, interrupts or reduces our supply, including for reasons outside of their control, or if any of our relationships with our suppliers is terminated, our operating results could be adversely affected. Such occurrences could also damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue, cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation. 
 37 

The market for semiconductor memory products is characterized by declines in average selling prices, which we expect to continue, and which could negatively affect our reven  ue and margins.  
 Our customers expect the average selling price of our products to decrease year-over-year and we expect this trend to continue. When such pricing declines occur, we may not be able to mitigate the effects by selling more or higher margin units, or by reducing our manufacturing costs. In such circumstances, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our legacy and new flash memory products have experienced declining average selling prices over their life cycle. The rate of decline may be affected by a number of factors, including relative supply and demand, the level of competition, production costs and technological changes. As a result of the decreasing average selling prices of our products following their launch, our ability to increase or maintain our margins depends on our ability to introduce new or enhanced products with higher average selling prices and to reduce our per-unit cost of sales and our operating costs. We may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities, and our costs may even increase because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, which could also reduce our gross margins. In addition, our new or enhanced products may not be as successful or enjoy as high margins as we expect. If we are unable to offset any reductions in average selling prices by introducing new products with higher average selling prices or reducing our costs, our revenue and margins will be negatively affected and may decrease. 
 The semiconductor memory market is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns in the past, generally as a result of wide fluctuations in supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, continuous new product introductions and price erosion. During downturns, periods of intense competition, or the presence of oversupply in the industry, the selling prices for our products may decline at a high rate over relatively short time periods as compared to historical rates of decline. We are unable to predict selling prices for any future periods and may experience unanticipated, sharp declines in selling prices for our products. 
 Our growth depends on the growth and development of the emerging IoT industry, and if the market does not develop as we expect, our business prospects may be harmed. 
 Our products are increasingly being utilized in IoT edge devices. The IoT industry is nascent and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, devices and connectivity requirements, evolving industry standards and changing customer demands. The continued development of IoT depends in part on significant growth in the number of connected devices. Such growth is affected by various factors, including the continued growth in the use of mobile operator networks and the Internet to connect an increasing number and variety of devices, price reductions for key hardware and software components, innovation of other components of the IoT nodes toward low-power formats, and the continued development of IoT standards and protocols. Without these continued developments, IoT might not gain widespread market acceptance and our business could suffer. Security and privacy concerns, evolving business practices and consumer preferences may also slow the growth and development of IoT. Because our revenue growth ultimately depends upon the success of IoT, our business may suffer as a result of slowing or declining growth in IoT adoption. Even if the IoT industry does develop, we may not be well positioned or able to penetrate and capitalize on this new market. As a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain. 
 The markets for our products are evolving, and changing market conditions, such as the introduction of new technologies or changes in customer preferences, may negatively affect demand for our products. If we fail to properly anticipate or respond to changing market conditions, our business prospects and results of operations will suffer. 
 The NVM industry is subject to constant and rapid changes in technology, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, rapid product obsolescence and evolving technical standards. New technologies may be introduced that make the current technologies on which our products are based less competitive or obsolete or require us to make changes to our technology that could be expensive and time consuming to implement. Due to the evolving nature of our markets, our future success depends on our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to changes in industry standards, technological requirements, customer and consumer preferences and other market conditions. Our technologies could become obsolete sooner than we expect because of faster than anticipated, or unanticipated, changes in one or more of the industry standards and technological requirements. We may be unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced technologies that satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner or at all, succeed in commercializing the technologies on which we have focused our research and development expenditures to develop, and anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we may be unable to retain customers or attract new customers. Any decrease in demand for our products, or the need for low-power products in general, due to the emergence of competing technologies, changes in customer preferences and requirements or other factors, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 38 

We must continuously develop new and enhanced products, and if we are unable to succes  sfully market our new and enhanced products for which we incur significant expenses to develop, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.  
 In order to compete effectively in our markets, we must continually design, develop and introduce new and improved products with improved features in a cost-effective manner in response to changing technologies and market demand. This requires us to devote substantial financial and other resources to research and development. We are developing next-generation products, which we expect to be one of the drivers of our revenue growth in the future. However, we may not succeed in developing and marketing these new and enhanced products. We also face the risk that customers may not value or be willing to bear the cost of incorporating our new and enhanced products into their products, particularly if they believe their customers are satisfied with current solutions. Regardless of the improved features or superior performance of our new and enhanced products, customers may be unwilling to adopt our solutions due to design or pricing constraints, or because they do not want to rely on a single or limited supply source. Because of the extensive time and resources that we invest in developing new and enhanced products, if we are unable to sell customers new generations of our products, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively affected. For example, we generated limited revenue from sales of our Mavriq and Moneta products to date. While we expect revenue from our Mavriq and Moneta products to grow, we may not be able to materially increase our revenue from this product family. Similarly, any of our more recently-introduced products or product families based on CBRAM or floating gate architecture may not achieve market acceptance and contribute significantly to our revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop and market our new and enhanced products that we have incurred significant expenses developing, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our success and future revenue depend on our ability to secure design wins and on our customers  ability to successfully sell the products that incorporate our solutions. Securing design wins is a lengthy, expensive and competitive process, and may not result in actual orders and sales, which could cause our revenue to decline. 
 We sell to customers that incorporate our NVM into their products. A design win occurs after a customer has tested our product, verified that it meets the customer s requirements, qualified our solutions for their products and placed an order for the purchase of our products. Our customers may need several months to years to test, evaluate and adopt our product and additional time to begin volume production of the product that incorporates our solution. Due to this generally lengthy design cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in our products to the time that we generate revenue from sales of these products. Moreover, even if a customer selects our solution, we cannot guarantee that this will result in any sales of our products, as the customer may ultimately change or cancel its product plans, or efforts by our customer to market and sell its product may not be successful. We may not generate any revenue from design wins after incurring the associated costs, which would cause our business and operating results to suffer. 
 If a current or prospective customer designs a competitor s solution into its product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our solutions to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant time, cost, effort and risk for the customer even if our solutions remain compatible with their product design. If current or prospective customers do not include our solutions in their products and we fail to achieve a sufficient number of design wins, our results of operations and business may be harmed. 
 We rely on our relationships with OEMs and ODMs to enhance our solutions and market position, and our failure to continue to develop or maintain such relationships in the future would harm our ability to remain competitive. 
 We develop our products for leading OEMs and ODMs that serve a variety of end markets and are developing devices for wearables, sensors, Bluetooth 4.0 and other IoT applications. For each application, manufacturers create products that incorporate specialized semiconductor technology, which makers of memory products use as the basis for their products. These manufacturers set the specifications for many of the key components to be used on each generation of their products and, in the case of memory components, generally qualify only a few vendors to provide memory components for their products. As each new generation of their products is released, vendors are validated in a similar fashion. We must work closely with semiconductor manufacturers to ensure our products become qualified for use in their products. As a result, maintaining close relationships with leading product manufacturers that are developing devices for wearables, Bluetooth 4.0 and other IoT applications is crucial to the long-term success of our business. We could lose these relationships for a variety of reasons, including our failure to qualify as a vendor, our failure to demonstrate the value of our new solutions, declines in product quality, or if OEMs or ODMs seek to work with vendors with broader product suites, greater production capacity or greater financial resources. If our relationships with key industry participants were to deteriorate or if our solutions were not qualified by our customers, our market position and revenue could be materially and adversely affected. 
 39 

Changes to industry standards and technical requirements relevant to our products and markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.  
 Our products are only a part of larger electronic systems. All products incorporated into these systems must comply with various industry standards and technical requirements created by regulatory bodies or industry participants in order to operate efficiently together. Industry standards and technical requirements in our markets are evolving and may change significantly over time. For our products, the industry standards are developed by the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, an industry trade organization. In addition, large industry-leading semiconductor and electronics companies play a significant role in developing standards and technical requirements for the product ecosystems within which our products can be used. Our customers also may design certain specifications and other technical requirements specific to their products and solutions. These technical requirements may change as the customer introduces new or enhanced products and solutions. 
 Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and comply with evolving industry standards and technical requirements. The emergence of new industry standards and technical requirements could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers or make it difficult for our products to meet the requirements of certain of our customers in consumer, industrial, IoT and other markets. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards and requirements. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards and technical requirements for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins, our revenue may decline and we may incur significant expenses to redesign our products to meet the relevant standards, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 If sales of our customers  products decline or if their products do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Our revenue depends on our customers  ability to commercialize their products successfully. The markets for our customers  products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. Competition in our customers  markets is based on a variety of factors including price, performance, product quality, marketing and distribution capability, customer support, name recognition and financial strength. As a result of rapid technological change, the markets for our customers  products are characterized by frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, fluctuating demand and increasing product capabilities. As a result, our customers  products may not achieve market success or may become obsolete. We cannot assure you that our customers will dedicate the resources necessary to promote and commercialize their products, successfully execute their business strategies for such products, or be able to manufacture such products in quantities sufficient to meet demand or cost-effectively manufacture products at a high volume. Our customers do not have contracts with us that require them to manufacture, distribute or sell any products. Moreover, our customers may develop internally, or in collaboration with our competitors, technology that they may utilize instead of the technology available to them through us. Our customers  failure to achieve market success for their products, including as a result of general declines in our customers  markets or industries, could negatively affect their willingness to utilize our products, which may result in a decrease in our revenue and negatively affect our business and operating results. 
 Our revenue also depends on the timely introduction, quality and market acceptance of our customers  products that incorporate our solutions. Our customers  products are often very complex and subject to design complexities that may result in design flaws, as well as potential defects, errors and bugs. We have in the past been subject to delays and project cancellations as a result of design flaws in the products developed by our customers. For example, in 2014 flaws in one of our customer s products that were unrelated to our memory solutions generated negative publicity for our customer and delayed the product s release until it could be redesigned. In the past, we have also been subject to delays and project cancellations as a result of changing market requirements, such as the customer adding a new feature, or because a customer s product fails their end customer s evaluation or field trial. Customer products may also be delayed due to issues with other vendors of theirs. We incur significant design and development costs in connection with designing our solutions for customers  products. If our customers discover design flaws, defects, errors or bugs in their products, or if they experience changing market requirements, failed evaluations or field trials, or issues with other vendors, they may delay, change or cancel a project. If we have already incurred significant development costs, we may not be able to recoup those costs, which in turn would adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 We face competition and expect competition to increase in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our revenue growth and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. 
   The global semiconductor market in general, and the semiconductor memory market in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as other semiconductor companies enter our markets, many of which have greater financial and other resources with which to pursue technology development, product design, manufacturing, marketing and sales and distribution of their products. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. Currently, our competitors range from  
 40 

large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to companies specializing in other alternative, specialized emerging memory technologies. Our primary competitors include Macronix Inte  rnational Co. Ltd., Microchip Technology Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., Spansion Inc. (acquired by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation), STMicroelectronics NV and Winbond Electronics Corp. In addition, as the IoT market opportunity grows, we expect new entra  nts will enter these markets and existing competitors, including leading semiconductor companies, may make significant investments to compete more effectively against our products. These competitors could develop technologies or architectures that make our   products or technologies obsolete.  
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including: 

the functionality and performance of our products and those of our competitors;     

our relationships with our customers and other industry participants;     

prices of our products and prices of our competitors  products;     

our ability to develop innovative products;     

our ability to retain high-level talent, including our management team and engineers; and     

the actions of our competitors, including merger and acquisition activity, launches of new products and other actions that could change the competitive landscape.     

 Competition could result in pricing pressure, reduced revenue and profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. In the event of a market downturn, competition in the markets in which we operate may intensify as our customers reduce their purchase orders. Our competitors that are significantly larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources or more established market recognition than us may be better positioned to accept lower prices and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. 
 Our customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, our business and operating results would suffer. 
 Prior to selecting and purchasing our products, our customers typically require that our products undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our products in the customers  systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process may continue for several months or years. However, obtaining the requisite qualifications for a memory product does not assure any sales of the product. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision in our third-party contractors  manufacturing process or our selection of a new contract manufacturer may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified and selected, it can and often does take several months or more before the customer commences volume production of systems that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of those products may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and harm our business. 
 Our costs may increase substantially if our third-party manufacturing contractors do not achieve satisfactory product yields or quality. 
 The fabrication process is extremely complicated and small changes in design, specifications or materials can result in material decreases in product yields or even the suspension of production. From time to time, the third-party foundries that we contract to manufacture our products may experience manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields related to errors or problems in their manufacturing processes or the interrelationship of their processes with our designs. In some cases, our third-party foundries may not be able to detect these defects early in the fabrication process or determine the cause of such defects in a timely manner. 
 Generally, in pricing our products, we assume that manufacturing yields will continue to improve, even as the complexity of our products increases. Once our products are initially qualified with our third-party foundries, minimum acceptable yields are established. We are responsible for the costs of the units if the actual yield is above the minimum. If actual yields are below the minimum we are not required to purchase the units. Typically, minimum acceptable yields for our new products are generally lower at first and gradually improve as we achieve full production. Unacceptably low product yields or other product manufacturing problems could substantially increase overall production time and costs and adversely impact our operating results. Product yield losses will increase our costs and reduce our gross margin. In addition to significantly harming our results of operations and cash flow, poor yields may delay shipment of our products and harm our relationships with existing and potential customers. 
 41 

The complexity of our products may lead to errors, defects and bugs, which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability.  
 Products as complex as ours may contain errors, defects and bugs when first introduced to customers or as new versions are released. Our products have in the past experienced such errors, defects and bugs. Delivery of products with production defects or reliability, quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. Errors, defects or bugs could cause problems with the functionality of our products, resulting in interruptions, delays or cessation of sales of these products to our customers. We may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems. We cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products, both before and after commencement of commercial production, despite testing by us, our suppliers or our customers. Any such problems could result in: 

delays in development, manufacture and roll-out of new products;     

additional development costs;     

loss of, or delays in, market acceptance;     

diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts;     

claims for damages by our customers or others against us; and     

loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers.     

 Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may experience difficulties in transitioning to new wafer fabrication process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. 
 We aim to use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our solutions that is available from our third-party foundries. As a result, we periodically evaluate the benefits of migrating our solutions to other technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. These ongoing efforts require us from time to time to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products, which in turn may result in delays in product deliveries. We may face difficulties, delays and increased expense as we transition our products to new processes, and potentially to new foundries. We will depend on our third-party foundries as we transition to new processes. We cannot assure you that our third-party foundries will be able to effectively manage such transitions or that we will be able to maintain our relationship with our third-party foundries or develop relationships with new third-party foundries. If we or any of our third-party foundries experience significant delays in transitioning to new processes or fail to efficiently implement transitions, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, any of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our operating results. 
 As smaller line width geometry manufacturing processes become more prevalent, we intend to move our future products to increasingly smaller geometries in order to reduce costs while integrating greater levels of functionality into our products. This transition will require us and our third-party foundries to migrate to new designs and manufacturing processes for smaller geometry products. We may not be able to achieve smaller geometries with higher levels of design integration or to deliver new integrated products on a timely basis. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance. We are dependent on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our third-party foundries will be able to effectively manage any such transition. If we or our third-party foundries experience significant delays in any such transition or fail to implement a transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. 
 If we fail to hire additional finance personnel and strengthen our financial reporting systems and infrastructure, we may not be able to timely and accurately report our financial results or comply with the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC reporting requirements. 
   We intend to hire additional accounting and finance staff with technical accounting, SEC reporting and Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance expertise. Any inability to recruit and retain such staff would have an adverse impact on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements. We may be unable to locate and hire qualified professionals with requisite technical and public company experience when and as needed. In addition, new employees will require time and training to learn our business and operating processes and procedures. If our finance and accounting organization is unable for any reason to respond adequately to the increased demands from being a public company, the quality and timeliness of our financial reporting may suffer, which could result in the identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls. For example, in 2015, our independent registered public accounting firm identified in their report to our audit committee that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial  
 42 

reporting as of December 31, 2014 due to our lack of sufficient, qualified personnel in accounting and financial repo  rting functions with sufficient experience and expertise with respect to the application of GAAP (as defined below) and related financial reporting, which led to a delay in the closing of our books and resulted in a number of post-closing adjustments to ou  r consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. Any consequences resulting from inaccuracies or delays in our reported financial statements could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and could   harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  
 If we fail to strengthen our financial reporting systems, infrastructure and internal control over financial reporting to meet the demands placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results timely and accurately and prevent fraud. We expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404. 
 A breach of our security systems may damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. 
 Our security systems are designed to protect our customers , suppliers  and employees  confidential information, as well as maintain the physical security of our facilities. We also rely on a number of third-party  cloud-based  service providers of corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and some finance functions, and we are, of necessity, dependent on the security systems of these providers. Any security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to the systems of our cloud-based service providers or the existence of computer viruses in their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of confidential information. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our information systems or facilities, or the existence of computer viruses in our data or software, could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to us, our customers or our suppliers. Any theft or misuse of this information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of this information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, our reputation, and our relationships with our customers and partners. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. 
 Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business. 
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, mask work protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how, in the United States and other jurisdictions. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate, particularly in foreign jurisdictions such as China. Any patents we hold may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights or our products against competitors, and third parties may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our issued patents. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents or patent applications that we hold. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application, as we do not believe patent protection of these products and technologies is critical to our business strategy at this time. A failure to timely seek patent protection on products or technologies generally precludes us from seeking future patent protection on these products or technologies. 
 In addition to patents, we also rely on contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures designed to protect our trade secrets and know-how. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property or damages arising out of such contracts. 
 We may initiate claims against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. It could also result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property, as an adverse decision could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially harm our business. 
 43 

We may face claims of intellectual property infringement, which could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle, result in the loss of significant rights, harm our relatio  nships with our customers and distributors, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 The semiconductor memory industry is characterized by companies that hold patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. These companies include patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. From time to time, third parties may assert against us and our customers  patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. 
 Claims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation, which could result in increased costs. Infringement claims also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to: 

cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;     

pay substantial damages for infringement;     

expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology, which may not be successful;     

license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;     

cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or     

pay substantial damages to our customers to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology, if available.     

 Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our exposure to the foregoing risks may also be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies or technologies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to the acquisition. 
 We rely upon third-party licensed technology to develop our products. If licenses of third-party technology are inadequate, our ability to develop and commercialize our products or product enhancements could be negatively impacted. 
 Our products incorporate technology licensed from third parties. In connection with our acquisition of certain flash memory assets from Atmel Corporation in 2012, we obtained a perpetual license to Atmel s flash memory technology. In addition, a component of our CBRAM technology is licensed from Axon Technology Corp. While we believe these licenses enable us to develop our products and pursue our current product strategies, these licenses may not provide us with the benefits we expect from them. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop our products or product enhancements. However, these third-party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology at a greater cost or of lower quality or performance standards or delay product development. Any of these results may limit our ability to develop new products, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 44 

Our success depe  nds on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategies.  
 Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain our key employees, including our management team and experienced engineers. Competition for personnel in the semiconductor technology field is intense, and the availability of suitable and qualified candidates is limited. We compete to attract and retain qualified research and development personnel with other semiconductor companies, universities and research institutions, particularly those in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located. The members of our management and key employees are at-will employees and although we recently issued refresh equity awards to our personnel in connection with our initial public offering in October 2015, there can be no assurance that these awards will be effective to retain our key employees. If we lose the services of any key senior management member or employee, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, which could severely impact our business and prospects. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our key engineers, or our inability to attract and retain qualified engineers, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and we may need to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements of our growth, either of which could harm our business and operating results. 
 As we continue to expand our business, we expect our headcount and overall size of our operations to grow significantly. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to expand our operational, engineering and financial systems, procedures and controls and to improve our accounting and other internal management systems. This may require substantial managerial and financial resources, and our efforts in this regard may not be successful. Our current systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we fail to adequately manage our growth, or to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, or fail to effectively motivate or manage our new and future employees, the quality of our products and the management of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 We have expanded in the past and may continue to expand in the future through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management s attention, result in additional dilution to stockholders or use resources that are necessary to operate our business. 
 In the past, we have grown our business through acquisitions and we may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in September 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation, which brought us a large customer base for products, a world-wide sales and distribution network and products and technology to further broaden our technology platform offerings. Such acquisitions or investments could create risks for us, including: 

difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel, operations and technologies or realizing synergies expected in connection with an acquisition, particularly with acquisitions of companies with large and widespread operations, complex products or that operate in markets in which we historically have had limited experience;     

unanticipated costs or liabilities, including possible litigation, associated with the acquisition;     

incurrence of acquisition-related costs;     

diversion of management s attention from other business concerns;     

use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and     

use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate an acquisition.     

 A significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If such acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations. 
 We may be unable to complete acquisitions at all or on commercially reasonable terms, which could limit our future growth. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt, which could adversely affect our operating results and result in a decline in our stock price and further restrict our ability to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results may suffer. 
 45 

We have operations outside of the United S  tates and intend to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks.  
 We have limited operations in Europe and Asia. We intend to expand our operations in Asia. The success of our business depends, in large part, on our ability to operate successfully from geographically disparate locations and to further expand our international operations and sales. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those we face in the United States. We cannot be sure that further international expansion will be successful. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could expose us to reduced demand for our products, lower prices for our products or other adverse effects on our operating results. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are: 

difficulties, inefficiencies and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;     

longer and more difficult customer qualification and credit checks;     

greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;     

the need for various local approvals to operate in some countries;     

difficulties in entering some foreign markets without larger-scale local operations;     

compliance with local laws and regulations;     

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including the elimination of tax holidays;     

reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;     

adverse tax consequences as a result of repatriating cash generated from foreign operations to the United States;     

adverse tax consequences, including potential additional tax exposure if we are deemed to have established a permanent establishment outside of the United States;     

the effectiveness of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar regulations;     

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the prices of our products to customers outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations by reducing the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk if, in the future, we denominate our international sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;     

new and different sources of competition; and     

political and economic instability, and terrorism.     

 Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our operations and reduce our revenue. 
 In order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we may need to modify our activities or incur substantial costs, and if we fail to comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or be required to have our suppliers alter their processes. 
 The semiconductor memory industry is subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local governmental regulations directed at preventing or mitigating environmental harm, as well as to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage or personal injury claims. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our business or require us to modify processes or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business. In response to environmental concerns, some customers and government agencies impose requirements for the elimination of hazardous substances, such as lead (which is widely used in soldering connections in the process of semiconductor packaging and assembly), from electronic equipment. For example, the European Union, or EU, adopted its Restriction on Hazardous Substance Directive which prohibits, with specified exceptions, the sale in the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead or other hazardous materials and China has enacted similar regulations. Environmental laws and regulations such as these could become more stringent over time, causing a need to redesign technologies, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could seriously harm our business. 
 46 

The issuance of new accounting standards or future interpretations of existing accounting standards could adversely affect our operating results.  
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. A change in those principles could have a significant effect on our reported results and might affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. GAAP is issued and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. The issuance of new accounting standards or future interpretations of existing accounting standards, or changes in our business practices or estimates, could result in future changes in our revenue recognition or other accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Our management team has limited experience managing a public company. 
 Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Some of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities, which could cause us to curtail our operations. 
 Our principal offices, and our contract manufacturers  and suppliers  facilities in Asia, are located near known earthquake fault zones and, therefore, are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods and similar events. If any such disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business and financial condition. 
 We may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs. 
 We have funded our operations since inception through equity financings, our borrowing arrangements and our initial public offering in October 2015. We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception, and we expect we will continue to incur operating and net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital to fund our ongoing operations, respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities, but we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing or raise additional capital in the public market on favorable terms or at all. 
 Our current credit facility limits our ability to incur indebtedness, and these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions subject to the consent of our lender. Any additional debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. 
 If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 
 Provisions of our debt agreements may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. 
 Borrowings under our $20.0 million credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility restricts our ability to, among other things: 

dispose of or sell assets;     

consolidate or merge with other entities;     

 47 

incur additional indebtedness;     

create liens on our assets;     

pay dividends;     

make investments;     

enter into transactions with affiliates; and     

redeem subordinated indebtedness.     

 These restrictions are subject to certain exceptions. In addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of the balance of unrestricted cash deposited with the lender to the total amounts owed with respect to the term loan thereunder to be less than 1.15 to 1.00. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the credit facility, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness thereunder to either (i) to become immediately due and payable and (ii) to be subject to an increase by 5% of the interest rate charged during the period of the unremedied breach 
 Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. 
 In general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an  ownership change  is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income, and tax credits to offset tax. In addition, although we do not expect to undergo an ownership change, we may experience an ownership change in the future, and our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credits could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our net operating losses and tax credits could also be impaired under state laws. As a result, we might not be able to utilize a material portion of our state NOLs and tax credits. 
 If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm to the extent we are no longer an  emerging growth company,  as defined by the JOBS Act. If we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing our internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which process will be time consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. 
 Regulations related to  conflict minerals  may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers. 
   Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements will require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our products, and affect our costs and relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers as we must obtain additional information from them to ensure our compliance with the disclosure requirement. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for  
 48 

these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our   reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and these customers may discontinue, or materially reduce, purchases of our produ  cts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected.  
 We are an emerging growth company. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 We are an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we become a large accelerated filer, which means that we have been public for at least 12 months, have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 The market price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in October 2015 at a price of $5.00 per share, our stock price has fluctuated significantly. In addition to the factors discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

overall performance of the equity markets in general, in our industry or in the markets we address;     

our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;     

changes in the estimates of our results of operations that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projected results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;     

announcements of technological innovations, new products or enhancements to products, acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;     

announcements of new business partners, on the termination of existing business partner arrangements or changes to our relationships with such business partners;     

recruitment or departure of key personnel;     

announcements of litigation or claims against us;     

changes in legal requirements relating to our business;     

the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers and end customers;     

trading activity by our principal stockholders;     

the expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements; and     

sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders.     

   In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a  
 49 

manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following perio  ds of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.  
 lf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If few analysts cover our company, the price and trading volume of our stock could suffer. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. 
 We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our term loan facility and is likely to be restricted by any future debt financing arrangement. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to increases in the price of our common stock, if any. 
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management. 
 Delaware corporate law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our board of directors that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. Among other things, these provisions: 

establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;     

provide that directors may be removed only  for cause  and only with the approval of stockholders representing 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding common stock;     

require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;     

authorize the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;     

eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;     

prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means that all stockholder actions will be required to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;     

provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and     

establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.     

 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any  interested  stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an  interested  stockholder. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

 (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock 
  On October 30, 2015, we completed our initial public offering in which we sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $5.00 per share. On November 4, 2015 we completed the sale of an additional 192,184 shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters  over-allotment option. The aggregate offering price for shares sold by us in the offering was approximately $26.0 million. The offer of up to 5,750,000 shares in the initial public offering, for a proposed maximum aggregate offering price of $28.75 million, were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-206940) that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2015. Needham   Company, LLC, Oppenheimer   Co. Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC were the underwriters for the offering. Following the sale of 5,192,184 shares in connection with the closing of the initial public offering and the sale of the shares subject to the over-allotment option, the offering terminated. We raised approximately $22.1 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1.9 million and other offering expenses of approximately $1.9 million.  As of September 30, 2016, we had used approximately $9.8 million of the estimated aggregate net proceeds from our initial public offering: to fund working capital and general corporate requirements in the ordinary course of business. The foregoing amounts represent our best estimate of our use of proceeds for the period indicated. No such payments were made to our directors or officers or their associates, holders of 10% or more of any class of our equity securities or to our affiliates.  We intend to use the net proceeds from the initial public offering for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes, including research and development activities, sales and marketing activities and capital expenditures, to enhance existing and develop new products and product families, expand our manufacturing capabilities or fund our growth.

Exhibit10.1  
 Exhibit 1.1 
 BUSINESS FINANCING AGREEMENT 

This BUSINESS FINANCING AGREEMENT, dated as of July 7, 2016, is made and entered into between WESTERN ALLIANCE BANK, AN ARIZONA CORPORATION (  Lender  ) and ADESTO TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (  Borrower  ) on the following terms and conditions: 

1.   
 
 REVOLVING CREDIT LINE.    

1.1   
 
 Advances.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the date on which this Agreement becomes effective until the Maturity Date, Lender will make Advances to Borrower not exceeding the Credit Limit or the Borrowing Base, whichever is less; provided that in no event shall Lender be obligated to make any Advance that results in an Overadvance or while any Overadvance is outstanding. Amounts borrowed under this Section may be repaid and reborrowed during the term of this Agreement. It shall be a condition to each Advance that (a) an Advance Request acceptable to Lender has been received by Lender, (b) all of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3 are true and correct on the date of such Advance as though made at and as of each such date except for representations and warranties that refer to a specific earlier date which must have been true and correct as of such earlier date, and (c) no Default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from such Advance.     

1.2   
 
 Advance Requests.  Borrower may request that Lender make an Advance by delivering to Lender an Advance Request therefor and Lender shall be entitled to rely on all the information provided by Borrower to Lender on or with the Advance Request. The Lender may honor Advance Requests, instructions or repayments given by the Borrower (if an individual) or by any Authorized Person.     

1.3   
 
  Due Diligence.   Lender may audit Borrower s Receivables and any and all records pertaining to the Collateral, at Lender s sole discretion and at Borrower s expense. The first such audit shall be completed prior to the first Advance being made and no less often than annually thereafter. Lender may at any time and from time to time contact Account Debtors and other persons obligated or knowledgeable in respect of Receivables to confirm the Receivable Amount of such Receivables, to determine whether Receivables constitute Eligible Receivables, and for any other purpose in connection with this Agreement. If any of the Collateral or Borrower's books or records pertaining to the Collateral are in the possession of a third party, Borrower authorizes that third party to permit Lender or its agents to have access to perform inspections or audits thereof and to respond to Lender's requests for information concerning such Collateral and records.     

(a)   
 
 Lender shall have the exclusive right to receive all Collections on all Receivables. Borrower shall (i) immediately notify, transfer and deliver to Lender all Collections Borrower receives for deposit into an account under the sole control of Lender (the  Collection Account ), (ii) deliver to Lender a detailed cash receipts journal on Friday of each week until the Lockbox is operational, and (iii) immediately enter into a collection services agreement acceptable to Lender (the   Lockbox Agreement  ) pursuant to which all Collections received in the Lockbox shall be deposited into the Collection Account. Borrower shall use the Lockbox address as the remit to and payment address for all of Borrower s Collections from Account Debtors, and Borrower shall instruct all Account Debtors to make payments either directly to the Lockbox for deposit by Lender directly to the Collection Account, or instruct them to deliver such payments to Lender by wire transfer, ACH, or other means as Lender may direct for deposit to the Lockbox or Collection Account. It will be considered an immediate Event of Default if this does not occur or the Lockbox is not operational within 15 days of the date of this Agreement.    

(b)   
 
   At Lender s option, Lender may either (i) transfer all Collections deposited into the Collection Account to Borrower s Account, or (ii) apply the Collections deposited into the Collection Account to the outstanding Account Balance, in either case, within three business days of the date received; provided that upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default, Lender may apply all Collections to the Obligations in such order and manner as Lender may determine. Lender has no duty to do any act other than to apply such amounts as required above. If an item of Collections is not honored or Lender does not receive good funds for any reason, any amount previously transferred to Borrower s Account or applied to the Account Balance shall be reversed as of the date transferred or applied, as applicable, and, if applied to the Account Balance, the Finance Charge will accrue as if the     

WEST\2698922 6 6.4 
 355157-  000162  1  

Collections had not been so applied. Lender shall have, with respect to any goods related to the Receivables, all the rights and remedies of an unpaid seller under the UCC and other applicable law, including the rights of replevin,   claim and delivery, reclamation and stoppage in transit.     

1.5   
 
 Receivables Activity Report.  Within 30 days after the end of each Month End, Lender shall send to Borrower a report covering the transactions for the prior billing period , including the amount of all Advances, Collections, Adjustments, Finance Charges, and other fees and charges. The accounting shall be deemed correct and conclusive unless Borrower makes written objection to Lender within 30 days after the Lender sends the accounting to Borrower.     

1.6   
 
 Adjustments.  Any Adjustments or disputes asserted by any Account Debtor will be, on a monthly basis (after receipt by Lender of the reporting required by Section 4.9(g) hereof), reviewed with Lender, in a matter satisfactory to Lender, and Lender will have the right to adjust the Borrowing Base reserve based on such review. So long as any Obligations are outstanding, Lender shall have the right, at any time, to take possession of any rejected, returned, or recovered personal property. If such possession is not taken by Lender and upon Lender s request, Borrower is to resell it for Lender s account at Borrower s expense with the proceeds made payable to Lender. While Borrower retains possession of any returned goods, Borrower shall segregate said goods and mark them as property of Lender.     

1.7   
 
 Recourse; Maturity.  Advances and the other Obligations shall be with full recourse against Borrower. On the Maturity Date, the Borrower will pay all then outstanding Advances and other Obligations to the Lender or such earlier date as shall be herein provided.

Borrower may use availability hereunder up to the Cash Management Sublimit for Lender's cash management services, which may include merchant services, direct deposit of payroll, business credit card, and check cashing services identified in various cash management services agreements related to such services (the    Cash Management Services   ). The entire Cash Management Sublimit will be treated as an Advance for purposes of determining availability under the Credit Limit and shall decrease, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount available for other Advances. The Cash Management Services shall be subject to additional terms set forth in applicable cash management services agreements. If at any time this Agreement is terminated or otherwise ceases to exist, Borrower shall immediately secure in cash all obligations with respect to Cash Management Services on terms reasonably acceptable to Lender.     

1.9

  Term Loan.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the date hereof, or as soon thereafter as all conditions precedent to the making thereof have been met, Lender hereby agrees to make a loan to Borrower in the principal amount of $18,000,000 (the   Term Loan  ) which shall be used to refinance all indebtedness owing from Borrower to Opus Bank and for general working capital.    

(b)   
 
  Interest on the Term Loan.  The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan shall accrue interest at the Term Loan Rate and shall be payable in accordance with Section 1.10(c).

(d)   
 
  Prepayment.  Borrower may prepay all but not less than all of the Term Loan at any time along with the Termination Fee.    

2.

  In the event the Jury Trial Waiver set forth above is not enforceable, the parties elect to proceed under this Judicial Reference Provision.     

14.2   
 
  With the exception of the items specified in Section 14.3, below, any controversy, dispute or claim (each, a    Claim   ) between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement between the undersigned parties (collectively in this Section, the    Loan Documents   ), will be resolved by a reference proceeding in California in accordance with the provisions of Sections 638 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure (   CCP   ), or their successor sections, which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for the resolution of any Claim, including whether the Claim is subject to the reference proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, venue for the reference proceeding will be in the state or federal court in the county or district where the real property involved in the action, if any, is located or in the state or federal court in the county or district where venue is otherwise appropriate under applicable law (the    Court   ).     

14.3   
 
    The matters that shall not be subject to a reference are the following: (i) nonjudicial foreclosure of any security interests in real or personal property, (ii) exercise of self-help remedies (including, without limitation, set-off), (iii) appointment of a receiver and (iv) temporary, provisional or ancillary remedies (including, without limitation, writs of attachment, writs of possession, temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions). This reference provision does not limit the right of any party to exercise or oppose any of the rights and remedies described in clauses (i) and exercise of, or opposition to, any of those items does not waive the right of any party to a reference pursuant to this reference provision as provided herein.     

14.4   
 
  The referee shall be a retired judge or justice selected by mutual written agreement of the parties. If the parties do not agree within ten (10) days of a written request to do so by any party, then, upon request of any party, the referee shall be selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). A request for appointment of a referee may be heard on an ex parte or expedited basis, and the parties agree that irreparable harm would result if ex parte relief is not granted. Pursuant to CCP   170.6, each party shall have one peremptory challenge to the referee selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative).     

14.5   
 
  The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the reference proceedings. Accordingly, the referee shall be requested, subject to change in the time periods specified herein for good cause shown, to (i) set the matter for a status and trial-setting conference within fifteen (15) days after the date of selection of the referee, (ii) if practicable, try all issues of law or fact within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the conference and (iii) report a statement of decision within twenty (20) days after the matter has been submitted for decision.     

14.6   
 
  The referee will have power to expand or limit the amount and duration of discovery. The referee may set or extend discovery deadlines or cutoffs for good cause, including a party s failure to provide requested discovery for any reason whatsoever. Unless otherwise ordered based upon good cause shown, no party shall be entitled to  priority  in conducting discovery, depositions may be taken by either party upon seven (7) days written notice, and all other discovery shall be responded to within fifteen (15) days after service. All disputes relating to discovery which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the referee whose decision shall be final and binding.     

14.7   
 
  Except as expressly set forth herein, the referee shall determine the manner in which the reference proceeding is conducted including the time and place of hearings, the order of presentation of evidence, and all other questions that arise with respect to the course of the reference proceeding. All proceedings and hearings conducted before the referee, except for trial, shall be conducted without a court reporter, except that when any party so requests, a court reporter will be used at any hearing conducted before the referee, and the referee will be provided a courtesy copy of the transcript. The party making such a request shall have the obligation to arrange for and pay the court reporter. Subject to the referee s power to award costs to the prevailing party, the parties will equally share the cost of the referee and the court reporter at trial.     

14.8   
 
    The referee shall be required to determine all issues in accordance with existing case law and the statutory laws of the State of California. The rules of evidence applicable to proceedings at law in the State of California will be applicable to the reference proceeding. The referee shall be empowered to enter equitable as well as legal relief, enter equitable orders that will be binding on the parties and rule on any motion which would be authorized in a court proceeding, including without limitation motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The referee shall issue a decision at the close of the reference proceeding which disposes of all claims of the parties that are the subject of the reference. Pursuant to CCP   644, such decision shall be entered by the Court as a judgment or an order in the same manner as if the action had      

WEST\2698922 6 6.4 
 355157-  000162  13  

been tried by the Court and any such decision will be final, binding and conclusive. The   parties reserve the right to appeal from the final judgment or order or from any appealable decision or order entered by the referee. The parties reserve the right to findings of fact, conclusions of laws, a written statement of decision, and the right to   move for a new trial or a different judgment, which new trial, if granted, is also to be a reference proceeding under this provision.     

14.9   
 
  If the enabling legislation which provides for appointment of a referee is repealed (and no successor statute is enacted), any dispute between the parties that would otherwise be determined by reference procedure will be resolved and determined by arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or justice, in accordance with the California Arbitration Act  1280 through  1294.2 of the CCP as amended from time to time. The limitations with respect to discovery set forth above shall apply to any such arbitration proceeding.     

14.10   
 
  THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT ALL CONTROVERSIES, DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RESOLVED UNDER THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL BE DECIDED BY A REFEREE AND NOT BY A JURY. AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF ITS, HIS OR HER OWN CHOICE, EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES, AGREES THAT THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL APPLY TO ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

16.   
 
  CONFIDENTIALITY.   In handling any confidential information Lender and all employees and agents of Lender, including but not limited to accountants, shall exercise the same degree of care that it exercises with respect to its own proprietary information of the same types to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information thereby received or received pursuant to this Agreement except that disclosure of such information may be made (i) to the subsidiaries or affiliates of Lender in connection with their present or prospective business relations with Borrower, (ii) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in the Advances or the Term Loan, (iii) as required by law, regulations, rule or order, subpoena, judicial order or similar order, (iv) as may be required in connection with the examination, audit or similar investigation of Lender and (v) as Lender may determine in connection with the enforcement of any remedies hereunder.

18.   
 
 OTHER AGREEMENTS.  Any security agreements, liens and/or security interests securing payment of any obligations of Borrower owing to Lender or its Affiliates also secure the Obligations, and are valid and subsisting and are not adversely affected by execution of this Agreement. An Event of Default under this Agreement constitutes a default under other outstanding agreements between Borrower and Lender or its Affiliates.     

19.   
 
   REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS.  If the incurrence or payment of the Obligations by Borrower or any guarantor, or the transfer to Lender of any property should for any reason subsequently be asserted, or declared, to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (each, a    Voidable Transfer   ), and if Lender is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys'

 (i) first, to the payment of all costs and expenses, including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys fees, incurred or made hereunder by Bank, including any such costs and expenses of foreclosure or suit, if any, and of any sale or the exercise of any other remedy under this Section 5, and of all taxes, assessments or liens superior to the lien granted under this Agreement; and 
 (ii) second, to the payment to Bank of the amount then owing under the Loan Agreement. 
 6.  Power of Attorney . Grantor hereby appoints Bank, Grantor s attorney-in-fact to prepare, sign and file or record, for Grantor in Grantor s name, any financing statements, applications for registration and like papers and to take any other action deemed by Bank necessary or desirable in order to perfect the security interest of the Bank hereunder, to dispose of any Collateral, and to perform any obligations of Grantor hereunder, at Grantor s expense, but without obligation to do so. 
 7.  Remedies Cumulative . Bank s rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall be cumulative.  Bank shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as provided under the California Uniform Commercial Code (the  UCC ), by law, or in equity.  No exercise by Bank of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by Bank of any Event of Default on Borrower s or Grantor s part shall be deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by Bank shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it. No waiver by Bank shall be effective unless made in a written document signed on behalf of Bank and then shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. 

8.   Amendment of Loan Documents  . Grantor authorizes Bank, without notice or demand and without affecting its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew,   extend, or otherwise change the terms of any Loan Document, or any part thereof; (b) take and hold security for the payment of any Loan Document, and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; and (c) apply such security and direct the order o  r manner of sale thereof as Bank in its sole discretion may determine.  
 9.  Grantor Waivers . Grantor waives any right to require Bank to (a) proceed against Borrower, any other guarantor or any other person; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower; (c) marshal any assets of Borrower; or (d) pursue any other remedy in Bank s power whatsoever.  Bank may, at its election, exercise or decline or fail to exercise any right or remedy it may have against Borrower or any security held by Bank, including without limitation the right to foreclose upon any such security by judicial or nonjudicial sale, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Grantor hereunder. Grantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Borrower or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Borrower. Grantor waives any setoff, defense or counterclaim that Borrower may have against Bank. Grantor waives any defense arising out of the absence, impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement or subrogation or any other rights against Borrower. Until all obligations under the Guaranty have been satisfied, Grantor shall have no right of subrogation or reimbursement, contribution or other rights against Borrower, and Grantor waives any right to enforce any remedy that Bank now has or may hereafter have against Borrower. Grantor waives all rights to participate in any security now or hereafter held by Bank. Grantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, and notices of acceptance of this Agreement and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness. Grantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping himself informed of the financial condition of Borrower and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of any indebtedness or nonperformance of any obligation of Borrower, warrants to Bank that Grantor will keep so informed, and agrees that absent a request for particular information by Grantor, Bank shall have no duty to advise Grantor of information known to Bank regarding such condition or any such circumstances. Grantor waives the benefits of California Civil Code sections 2809, 2810, 2819, 2845, 2847, 2848, 2849, 2850, 2899 and 3433. 
 10.  Borrower Insolvency . If Borrower becomes insolvent or is adjudicated bankrupt or files a petition for reorganization, arrangement, composition or similar relief under any present or future provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or if such a petition is filed against Borrower, and in any such proceeding some or all of any indebtedness or obligations under the Loan Documents are terminated or rejected or any obligation of Borrower is modified or abrogated, or if Borrower s obligations are otherwise avoided for insolvency, bankruptcy or any similar reason, Grantor agrees that Grantor s liability hereunder shall not thereby be affected or modified and such liability shall continue in full force and effect as if no such action or proceeding had occurred.  This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if any payment must be returned by Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower, Grantor, any other person, or otherwise, as though such payment had not been made. 
 11.  Notices . Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices or demands by any party relating to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection herewith shall be in writing and (except for financial statements and other informational documents which may be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid) shall be personally delivered or sent by a recognized overnight delivery service, certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by telefacsimile to Grantor or to Bank, as the case may be, at its addresses set forth below: 

The parties hereto may change the address at which they are to receive notices hereunder, by notice in writing in the foregoing manner given to the other. 
   12.  Jury Trial Waiver . EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE  

OBLIGATIONS OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY OBLIGATION, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER AR  ISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN O  RIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  EACH PARTY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER, HAS DETERMINED FO  R ITSELF THE NECESSITY TO REVIEW THE SAME WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.  
 13.  Reference Provision . 
 13.1 In the event the Jury Trial Waiver set forth above is not enforceable, the parties elect to proceed under this Judicial Reference Provision. 
 13.2 With the exception of the items specified in Section 13.3, below, any controversy, dispute or claim (each, a   Claim  ) between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement between the undersigned parties (collectively in this Section, the   Loan Documents  ), will be resolved by a reference proceeding in California in accordance with the provisions of Sections 638 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure (  CCP  ), or their successor sections, which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for the resolution of any Claim, including whether the Claim is subject to the reference proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, venue for the reference proceeding will be in the state or federal court in the county or district where the real property involved in the action, if any, is located or in the state or federal court in the county or district where venue is otherwise appropriate under applicable law (the   Court  ). 
 13.3 The matters that shall not be subject to a reference are the following: (i) nonjudicial foreclosure of any security interests in real or personal property, (ii) exercise of self-help remedies (including, without limitation, set-off), (iii) appointment of a receiver and (iv) temporary, provisional or ancillary remedies (including, without limitation, writs of attachment, writs of possession, temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions). This reference provision does not limit the right of any party to exercise or oppose any of the rights and remedies described in clauses (i) and (ii) or to seek or oppose from a court of competent jurisdiction any of the items described in clauses (iii) and (iv). The exercise of, or opposition to, any of those items does not waive the right of any party to a reference pursuant to this reference provision as provided herein. 
 13.4 The referee shall be a retired judge or justice selected by mutual written agreement of the parties. If the parties do not agree within ten (10) days of a written request to do so by any party, then, upon request of any party, the referee shall be selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). A request for appointment of a referee may be heard on an ex parte or expedited basis, and the parties agree that irreparable harm would result if ex parte relief is not granted.  Pursuant to CCP   170.6, each party shall have one peremptory challenge to the referee selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). 
 13.5 The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the reference proceedings. Accordingly, the referee shall be requested, subject to change in the time periods specified herein for good cause shown, to (i) set the matter for a status and trial-setting conference within fifteen (15) days after the date of selection of the referee, (ii) if practicable, try all issues of law or fact within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the conference and (iii) report a statement of decision within twenty (20) days after the matter has been submitted for decision. 
 13.6 The referee will have power to expand or limit the amount and duration of discovery. The referee may set or extend discovery deadlines or cutoffs for good cause, including a party s failure to provide requested discovery for any reason whatsoever.  Unless otherwise ordered based upon good cause shown, no party shall be entitled to  priority  in conducting discovery, depositions may be taken by either party upon seven (7) days written notice, and all other discovery shall be responded to within fifteen (15) days after service. All disputes relating to discovery which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the referee whose decision shall be final and binding. 
   13.7 Except as expressly set forth herein, the referee shall determine the manner in which the reference proceeding is conducted including the time and place of hearings, the order of presentation of evidence, and all other questions that arise with respect to the course of the reference proceeding. All proceedings and hearings conducted before the referee, except for trial, shall be conducted without a court reporter, except that when any party so requests, a court reporter will be used at any hearing conducted  

before the referee, and the referee will be provided a courtesy copy of the transcript.  The party making such a request shall have the obligation to arrange for and pay the court reporter.  Subject to the referee s power to award costs to the prevai  ling party, the parties will equally share the cost of the referee and the court reporter at trial.  
 13.8 The referee shall be required to determine all issues in accordance with existing case law and the statutory laws of the State of California.  The rules of evidence applicable to proceedings at law in the State of California will be applicable to the reference proceeding. The referee shall be empowered to enter equitable as well as legal relief, enter equitable orders that will be binding on the parties and rule on any motion which would be authorized in a court proceeding, including without limitation motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The referee shall issue a decision at the close of the reference proceeding which disposes of all claims of the parties that are the subject of the reference.  Pursuant to CCP   644, such decision shall be entered by the Court as a judgment or an order in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court and any such decision will be final, binding and conclusive.  The parties reserve the right to appeal from the final judgment or order or from any appealable decision or order entered by the referee.  The parties reserve the right to findings of fact, conclusions of laws, a written statement of decision, and the right to move for a new trial or a different judgment, which new trial, if granted, is also to be a reference proceeding under this provision. 
 13.9 If the enabling legislation which provides for appointment of a referee is repealed (and no successor statute is enacted), any dispute between the parties that would otherwise be determined by reference procedure will be resolved and determined by arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or justice, in accordance with the California Arbitration Act  1280 through  1294.2 of the CCP as amended from time to time.  The limitations with respect to discovery set forth above shall apply to any such arbitration proceeding. 
 13.10 THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT ALL CONTROVERSIES, DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RESOLVED UNDER THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL BE DECIDED BY A REFEREE AND NOT BY A JURY.  AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF ITS, HIS OR HER OWN CHOICE, EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES, AGREES THAT THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL APPLY TO ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 
 14.  General Provisions . 
 14.1  Successors and Assigns . This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder may be assigned by Grantor without Bank s prior written consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in Bank s sole discretion.

 14.3  Time of Essence . Time is of the essence for the performance of all obligations set forth in this Agreement.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. 

14.7   Survival  . All covenants, representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall continue   in full force and effect so long as any Obligations remain outstanding, any Guarantor Obligations remain outstanding, or Bank has any obligation to make Credit Extensions to Borrower.

 WESTERN ALLIANCE BANK, an Arizona corporation    

 1.  The Guaranty.  For valuable consideration, the undersigned ( Guarantor ) hereby unconditionally guarantees and promises to pay promptly to WESTERN ALLIANCE BANK, AN ARIZONA CORPORATION ( Lender ), or order, in lawful money of the United States, any and all Indebtedness of ADESTO TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION ( Borrower ) to Lender when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty is not limited as to the principal amount of the Indebtedness guaranteed and includes, without limitation, liability for all interest, fees, indemnities (including, without limitation, hazardous waste indemnities), and other costs and expenses relating to or arising out of the Indebtedness. The liability of Guarantor is continuing and relates to any Indebtedness, including that arising under successive transactions which shall either continue the Indebtedness or from time to time renew it after it has been satisfied. This Guaranty is cumulative and does not supersede any other outstanding guaranties, and the liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty is exclusive of Guarantor s liability under any other guaranties signed by Guarantor. If more than one individual or entity sign this Guaranty, their obligations under this Guaranty shall be joint and several. 
 2.  Definitions.  As used herein: 
 (a)  Borrower  means the individual or the entity named in Paragraph 1 of this Guaranty and, if more than one, then any one or more of them. 
 (b)  Guarantor  means the individual or the entity signing this Guaranty and, if more than one, then any one or more of them, jointly and severally. 
 (c)  Indebtedness  means any and all debts, liabilities, and obligations of Borrower to Lender, now or hereafter existing, whether voluntary or involuntary and however arising, whether direct or indirect or acquired by Lender by assignment, succession, or otherwise, whether due or not due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, held or to be held by Lender for its own account or as agent for another or others, whether Borrower may be liable individually or jointly with others, whether recovery upon such debts, liabilities, and obligations may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether such debts, liabilities, and obligations may be or hereafter become otherwise unenforceable. Indebtedness includes, without limitation, any and all obligations of Borrower to Lender for reasonable attorneys  fees and all other costs and expenses incurred by Lender in the collection or enforcement of any debts, liabilities, and obligations of Borrower to Lender. 
 3.  Obligations Independent.  The obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of Borrower or any other guarantor, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether action is brought against Borrower or any other guarantor or whether Borrower or any other guarantor be joined in any such action or actions. Anyone executing this Guaranty shall be bound by its terms without regard to execution by anyone else. 
 4.  Rights of Lender.  Guarantor authorizes Lender, without notice or demand and without affecting its liability hereunder, from time to time to: (a) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate, or otherwise change the time for payment, or otherwise change the terms, of the Indebtedness or any part thereof, including increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon, or otherwise change the terms of the Indebtedness; (b) receive and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Indebtedness and exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any such security; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lender in its discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute any Guarantor or any one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Indebtedness. 
 5.  Guaranty to be Absolute.  Guarantor agrees that until the Indebtedness has been paid in full and any terminated, Guarantor shall not be released by or because of the taking, or failure to take, any action that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of Guarantor under this Guaranty or that, but for this paragraph, might discharge or otherwise reduce, limit, or modify Guarantor s obligations under this Guaranty. Guarantor waives and surrenders any defense to any liability under this Guaranty based upon any such action, including but not limited to any action of Lender described in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Guaranty. It is the express intent of Guarantor that Guarantor s obligations under this Guaranty are and shall be absolute and unconditional.

6.   Guarantor s Waivers of Certain Rights and Certain Defenses.   Guarantor waives: (a) any right to require Lender to proceed against Borrower, p  roceed against or exhaust any security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in Lender s power whatsoever; (b) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Borrower, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liabil  ity of Borrower other than the indefeasible satisfaction in full, in cash of all Obligations; (c) any defense based on any claim that Guarantor s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrower; and (d) the benefit of any statute of limita  tions affecting Guarantor s liability hereunder. No provision or waiver in this Guaranty shall be construed as limiting the generality of any other waiver contained in this Guaranty.  
 7.  Waiver of Subrogation.  Until the Indebtedness has been paid in full and any commitments of Lender or facilities provided by Lender with respect to the Indebtedness have been terminated, Guarantor agrees not to exercise or assert any right of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution (contractual, statutory, or otherwise) including, without limitation, any claim or right of subrogation under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any successor statute, arising from the existence or performance of this Guaranty, and Guarantor waives any right to enforce any remedy which Lender now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, and waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Lender. 
 8.  Waiver of Notices.  Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of intent to accelerate, notices of acceleration, notices of any suit or any other action against Borrower or any other person, any other notices to any party liable on the Indebtedness (including Guarantor), notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional Indebtedness. 
 9.  Waivers of Other Rights and Defenses.  
 (a) Guarantor waives any rights and defenses that are or may become available to Guarantor by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code until the Obligations have been indefeasibly satisfied in full in cash and any commitments of Lender or facilities provided by Lender with respect to the Obligations have been terminated. 
 (b) Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that Guarantor may have because any of the Indebtedness is secured by real property. This means, among other things: (i) Lender may collect from Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower; and (ii) if Lender forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by Borrower: (1) the amount of the Indebtedness may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) Lender may collect from Guarantor even if Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Guarantor may have because any of the Indebtedness is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. 
 (c) Guarantor waives any right or defense it may have at law or equity, including California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a, to a fair market value hearing or action to determine a deficiency judgment after a foreclosure. 
 10.    Sec  u  rity.  To   s e c u re   all   of   Gu a rant o r ' s   obligatio n s    h ere u nd e r,   G u arant o r    h as    e n t ered    i n t o   a    c  e rtain Third Party Security Agreement, of even date herewith, with Lender (the  Security Agreement ). 
 11.  Subordination.  Any obligations of Borrower to Guarantor, now or hereafter existing, including but not limited to any obligations to Guarantor as subrogee of Lender or resulting from Guarantor s performance under this Guaranty, are hereby subordinated to the Indebtedness. In addition to Guarantor s waiver of any right of subrogation as set forth in this Guaranty with respect to any obligations of Borrower to Guarantor as subrogee of Lender, Guarantor agrees that, if Lender so requests, Guarantor shall not demand, take, or receive from Borrower, by setoff or in any other manner, payment of any other obligations of Borrower to Guarantor until the Indebtedness has been paid in full and any commitments of Lender or facilities provided by Lender with respect to the Indebtedness have been terminated. If any payments are received by Guarantor in violation of such waiver or agreement, such payments shall be received by Guarantor as trustee for Lender and shall be paid over to Lender on account of the Indebtedness, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Any security interest, lien, or other encumbrance that Guarantor may now or hereafter have on any property of Borrower is hereby subordinated to any security interest, lien, or other encumbrance that Lender may have on any such property.

12.   Revocation of Guaranty.  
 (a) Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally, knowingly, and expressly waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future Indebtedness and, in light thereof, all protection afforded Guarantor under Section 2815 of the California Civil Code. Guarantor fully realizes and understands that, upon execution of this agreement, Guarantor will not have any right to revoke this Guaranty as to any future Indebtedness and, thus, may have no control over such Guarantor s ultimate responsibility for the Indebtedness. If, contrary to the express intent of this agreement, any such revocation is effective notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) no such revocation shall be effective until written notice thereof has been received by Lender; (b) no such revocation shall apply to any Indebtedness in existence on such date (including any subsequent continuation, extension, or renewal thereof, or change in the interest rate, payment terms, or other terms and conditions thereof); (c) no such revocation shall apply to any Indebtedness made or created after such date to the extent made or created pursuant to a legally binding commitment of Lender which is, or is believed in good faith by Lender to be, in existence on the date of such revocation; (d) no payment by Borrower, or from any other source, prior to the date of such revocation shall reduce the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder; and (e) any payment by Borrower or from any source other than such Guarantor, subsequent to the date of such revocation, shall first be applied to that portion of the obligations, if any, as to which the revocation by such Guarantor is effective (and which are not, therefore, guarantied by such Guarantor hereunder), and, to the extent so applied, shall not reduce the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder. 
 (b) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this Guaranty may be revoked only in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph and shall not be revoked simply as a result of any change in name, location, or composition or structure of Borrower, the dissolution of Borrower, or the termination, increase, decrease, or other change of any personnel or owners of Borrower. 
 13.  Reinstatement of Guaranty.  If this Guaranty is revoked, returned, or cancelled, and subsequently any payment or transfer of any interest in property by Borrower to Lender is rescinded or must be returned by Lender to Borrower, this Guaranty shall be reinstated with respect to any such payment or transfer, regardless of any such prior revocation, return, or cancellation. 
 14.  Stay of Acceleration.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Indebtedness is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of Borrower or otherwise, all such Indebtedness guaranteed by Guarantor shall nonetheless be payable by Guarantor immediately if requested by Lender. 
 15.  No Deductions.  All payments by Guarantor hereunder shall be paid in full, without setoff or counterclaim or any deduction or withholding whatsoever, including, without limitation, for any and all present and future taxes. In the event that Guarantor or Lender is required by law to make any such deduction or withholding, Guarantor agrees to pay on behalf of Lender such amount directly to the appropriate person or entity, or if the Guarantor cannot legally comply with the foregoing, Guarantor shall pay to Lender such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by Lender of the full amount payable hereunder. Guarantor shall promptly provide Lender with evidence of payment of any such amount made on Lender s behalf. 
 16.  Information Relating to Borrower.  Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it shall have the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from Borrower such information concerning Borrower s financial condition or business operations as Guarantor may require, and that Lender has no duty, and Guarantor is not relying on Lender, at any time to disclose to Guarantor any information relating to the business operations or financial condition of Borrower. 
 17.  Borrower s Authorization.  Where Borrower is a corporation, partnership, trust, or limited liability company, it is not necessary for Lender to inquire into the powers of Borrower or of the officers, directors, partners, members, managers, or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any Indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder, subject to any limitations on Guarantor s liability set forth herein. 
 18.  Information Relating to Guarantor.  Guarantor authorizes Lender to verify or check any information given by Guarantor to Lender, check Guarantor s credit references, verify employment, and obtain credit reports. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the authorizations provided in this paragraph apply to any individual general partner of Guarantor and to Guarantor s spouse and any such general partner s spouse if Guarantor or such general partner is married and lives in a community property state.

19.   Guarantor s Covenants.   Until the Indebtedness has been paid in full and any commitments of Lender o  r facilities provided by Lender with respect to the Indebtedness have been terminated and each and every term, covenant, and condition of this Guaranty is fully performed, Guarantor agrees:  
 (a) to provide the following financial information and statements in form and content acceptable to Lender, and such additional information as requested by Lender from time to time: 
 (i) Guarantor s annual financial statements upon request of Lender. These financial statements must be audited, (with an opinion satisfactory to Lender) by a Certified Public Accountant ( CPA ) acceptable to Lender; 
 (ii) Guarantor s quarterly financial statements upon request of Lender. These financial statements must be certified and dated by an authorized financial officer of Guarantor; 
 (iii) copies of Guarantor s federal income tax return (with all forms K-1 attached) together with a statement of any contributions made by Guarantor to any subchapter S corporation or trust, and, if requested by Lender, copies of any extensions of the filing date. 
 20.  Taxes.  Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United States of America. If Guarantor must make a payment under this Guaranty, Guarantor represents and warrants that it will make the payment from one of its U.S. resident offices to a U.S. office of Lender so that no withholding tax is imposed on the payment. If notwithstanding the foregoing, Guarantor makes a payment under this Guaranty to which withholding tax applies, then Guarantor shall pay any taxes (other than taxes on net income (a) imposed by the country or any subdivision of the country in which Lender s principal office or actual lending office is located and (b) measured by the United States taxable income Lender would have received if all payments under or in respect of this Guaranty were exempt from taxes levied by Guarantor s country) that are at any time imposed on any such payments under or in respect of this Guaranty including, but not limited to, payments made pursuant to this paragraph. Further, Guarantor shall also pay to Lender, on demand, all additional amounts that Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield Lender would have received if such taxes had not been imposed. 
 21.  Change of Status.  Guarantor shall not enter into any consolidation, merger, or other combination unless Guarantor is the surviving business entity. Further, Guarantor shall not change its legal structure unless (a) Guarantor obtains the prior written consent of Lender and (b) all Guarantor s obligations under this Guaranty are assumed by the new business entity. 
 22.  Notices.  All notices required under this Guaranty shall be personally delivered or sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or by overnight courier, to the addresses on the signature page of this Guaranty, or sent by facsimile to the fax numbers listed on the signature page, or to such other addresses as Lender and Guarantor may specify from time to time in writing. Notices sent by (a) first class mail shall be deemed delivered on the earlier of actual receipt or on the fourth business day after deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, (b) overnight courier shall be deemed delivered on the next business day, and (c) telecopy shall be deemed delivered when transmitted. 
 23.  Successors and Assigns.  This Guaranty (a) binds Guarantor and Guarantor s executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, provided that Guarantor may not assign its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of Lender, and (b) inures to the benefit of Lender and Lender s indorsees, successors, and assigns. Lender may, without notice to Guarantor and without affecting Guarantor s obligations hereunder, sell, assign, grant participations in, or otherwise transfer to any other person, firm, or corporation the Indebtedness and this Guaranty, in whole or in part. Guarantor agrees that Lender may disclose to any assignee or purchaser, or any prospective assignee or purchaser, of all or part of the Indebtedness any and all information in Lender s possession concerning Guarantor, this Guaranty, and any security for this Guaranty. 
 24.  Amendments, Waivers, and Severability.  No provision of this Guaranty may be amended or waived except in writing. No failure by Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any of its rights, remedies, or powers shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, or power shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, or power. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision of this Guaranty. 
 25.  Costs and Expenses.  Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable attorneys  fees, including allocated costs of Lender s in-house counsel, and all other costs and expenses which may be incurred by Lender (a) in the enforcement of this Guaranty or (b) in the preservation, protection, or enforcement of any rights of Lender in any case commenced by or against Guarantor or Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any similar or successor statute.

26.   Governing Law and Jurisdiction.   This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California. Guarantor ir  revocably (a) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of California in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty and (b) waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any defen  se asserting an inconvenient forum in connection therewith. Service of process by Lender in connection with such action or proceeding shall be binding on Guarantor if sent to Guarantor by registered or certified mail at its address specified below.  
 27.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER, HAS DETERMINED FOR ITSELF THE NECESSITY TO REVIEW THE SAME WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. 
 28.  Reference Provision.  
 a. In the event the Jury Trial waiver is not enforceable, the parties elect to proceed under this Judicial Reference Provision. 
 b. With the exception of the items specified in Section 28(c) below, any controversy, dispute or claim (each, a  Claim ) between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement between the undersigned parties (collectively in this Section, the  Loan Documents ), will be resolved by a reference proceeding in California in accordance with the provisions of Sections 638 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure ( CCP ), or their successor sections, which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for the resolution of any Claim, including whether the Claim is subject to the reference proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, venue for the reference proceeding will be in the state or federal court in the county or district where the real property involved in the action, if any, is located or in the state or federal court in the county or district where venue is otherwise appropriate under applicable law (the  Court ). 
 c. The matters that shall not be subject to a reference are the following: (i) nonjudicial foreclosure of any security interests in real or personal property, (ii) exercise of self-help remedies (including, without limitation, set-off), (iii) appointment of a receiver and (iv) temporary, provisional or ancillary remedies (including, without limitation, writs of attachment, writs of possession, temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions). This reference provision does not limit the right of any party to exercise or oppose any of the rights and remedies described in clauses (i) and (ii) or to seek or oppose from a court of competent jurisdiction any of the items described in clauses (iii) and (iv). The exercise of, or opposition to, any of those items does not waive the right of any party to a reference pursuant to this reference provision as provided herein. 
 d. The referee shall be a retired judge or justice selected by mutual written agreement of the parties. If the parties do not agree within ten (10) days of a written request to do so by any party, then, upon request of any party, the referee shall be selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). A request for appointment of a referee may be heard on an ex parte or expedited basis, and the parties agree that irreparable harm would result if ex parte relief is not granted. Pursuant to CCP   170.6, each party shall have one peremptory challenge to the referee selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). 
 e. The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the reference proceedings. Accordingly, the referee shall be requested, subject to change in the time periods specified herein for good cause shown, to (i) set the matter for a status and trial-setting conference within fifteen (15) days after the date of selection of the referee, (ii) if practicable, try all issues of law or fact within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the conference and (iii) report a statement of decision within twenty (20) days after the matter has been submitted for decision. 
   f. The referee will have power to expand or limit the amount and duration of discovery. The referee may set or extend discovery deadlines or cutoffs for good cause, including a party s failure to provide requested discovery for any reason whatsoever. Unless otherwise ordered based upon good cause shown, no party shall be entitled to  priority  in conducting discovery, depositions may be taken by either party upon seven (7) days written notice, and all other discovery shall be responded to within fifteen (15) days  
 5 
  r.   4.6.11 
 WEST\2699754 6 8.2 
 355157- 0 00162 

after ser  vice. All disputes relating to discovery which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the referee whose decision shall be final and binding.  
 g. Except as expressly set forth herein, the referee shall determine the manner in which the reference proceeding is conducted including the time and place of hearings, the order of presentation of evidence, and all other questions that arise with respect to the course of the reference proceeding. All proceedings and hearings conducted before the referee, except for trial, shall be conducted without a court reporter, except that when any party so requests, a court reporter will be used at any hearing conducted before the referee, and the referee will be provided a courtesy copy of the transcript. The party making such a request shall have the obligation to arrange for and pay the court reporter. Subject to the referee s power to award costs to the prevailing party, the parties will equally share the cost of the referee and the court reporter at trial. 
 h. The referee shall be required to determine all issues in accordance with existing case law and the statutory laws of the State of California. The rules of evidence applicable to proceedings at law in the State of California will be applicable to the reference proceeding. The referee shall be empowered to enter equitable as well as legal relief, enter equitable orders that will be binding on the parties and rule on any motion which would be authorized in a court proceeding, including without limitation motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The referee shall issue a decision at the close of the reference proceeding which disposes of all claims of the parties that are the subject of the reference. Pursuant to CCP   644, such decision shall be entered by the Court as a judgment or an order in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court and any such decision will be final, binding and conclusive. The parties reserve the right to appeal from the final judgment or order or from any appealable decision or order entered by the referee. The parties reserve the right to findings of fact, conclusions of laws, a written statement of decision, and the right to move for a new trial or a different judgment, which new trial, if granted, is also to be a reference proceeding under this provision. 
 i. If the enabling legislation which provides for appointment of a referee is repealed (and no successor statute is enacted), any dispute between the parties that would otherwise be determined by reference procedure will be resolved and determined by arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or justice, in accordance with the California Arbitration Act  1280 through  1294.2 of the CCP as amended from time to time. The limitations with respect to discovery set forth above shall apply to any such arbitration proceeding. 
 j. THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT ALL CONTROVERSIES, DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RESOLVED UNDER THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL BE DECIDED BY A REFEREE AND NOT BY A JURY. AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF ITS, HIS OR HER OWN CHOICE, EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES, AGREES THAT THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL APPLY TO ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 
 29.  Remedies.  All rights and remedies provided in this Guaranty and any instrument or agreement referred to herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise provided by law. Any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude the further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. 
 30.  Severability.  The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Guaranty or any instrument or agreement referred to herein shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Guaranty or any instrument or agreement referred to herein.
