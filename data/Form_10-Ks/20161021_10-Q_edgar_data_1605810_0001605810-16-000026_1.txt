NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     AUGUST 31, 2016     (unaudited)              NOTE 1     ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS        Uni Line Corp. was incorporated   in the State of Nevada on September 05, 2013. We are in the development-stage formed to sell freshly squeezed juices from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom. We are located at Barons Court Road flat 1, London, W14 9DU, Great Britain and our telephone number is 44 020 3287 6608.        NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         Development Stage Company        The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated since inception has been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities.       The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.  Upon adoption, the Company no longer presents or discloses inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915.        Interim Financial Statements        The interim financial statements are condensed and should be read in conjunction with the company   s latest annual financial statements and it is management   s opinion that all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation for the interim periods have been made, and that all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature that there were no adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments.        Basis of Presentation    The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.          Going Concern        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company had no revenues as of August 31, 2016.  The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.         Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it August be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management   s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.            Accounting Basis         7  |   Page        The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (   GAAP    accounting).  The Company has adopted a February 28 fiscal year end.        Cash and Cash Equivalents    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of Three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had zero of cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2016.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments    The Company   s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.        Income Taxes    Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.  A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.        Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.    Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.        Stock-Based Compensation    Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.            Basic Income (Loss) Per Share    Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company   s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company   s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of August 31, 2016.        Comprehensive Income    The Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances.  When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders    Equity.  Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements        In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB   ) issued Accounting Standards Update (   ASU   ) 2014-10,    Development Stage Entities   .  The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage         8  |   Page        entity from the Master Glossary of the ASC thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments in this update are applied retrospectively.  The adoption of ASU 2014-10 removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements for the Company.        NOTE 3     LOAN FROM DIRECTOR        On January 1, 2014, a director loaned $100 to the Company to open bank account.       On April 3, 2014, a director loaned $3,000 to the Company.       On August 01, 2014, a director loaned $1,500 to the Company.       On June 30, 2014, a director loaned $2,000 to the Company.       On September 3, 2014, a director loaned $5,500 to the Company.       On December 1, 2014, a director was repaid the amount of $ 4,666 from the company account.       On April 23, 2016, a director prepaid expenses in the amount of $3,250 to our auditor.       On August 9, 2016, a director paid expenses in the amount of $3,000 to our auditor.       The remaining loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.       The balance due to the director was $13,684 as of August 31, 2016.        NOTE 4-   FIXED ASSETS        Company purchased Super Angel All Stainless Steel Twin Gear Juicer- 5500. 
          No depreciation was recorded during the period from inception through August 31, 2016.        NOTE 5     COMMON STOCK        The Company has 75,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock authorized.       On January 24, 2014, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock to a director for cash proceeds of $6,000 at $0.001 per share.            9  |   Page        As of August 31, 2016, the Company issued 2,110,000 shares of common stock to 28 shareholders for cash proceeds of $ of 21,088 at $0.01 per share.       There were 8,110,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2016.        NOTE 6     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES        The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. An officer has provided office services without charge.  There is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement.  Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein.  The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future.        NOTE 7     INCOME TAXES        As of August 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $ 39,622  that August be available to reduce future years    taxable income in varying amounts through 2031. Future tax benefits which August arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.       The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following:                     The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows:             Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $39,622 for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards August be limited as to use in future years.            NOTE 8     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS             10  |   Page        The Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to October 12, 2016 and to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.               FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS       Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "August," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what August occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.            ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION                EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS       At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director.  We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we August adopt such plans in the future.  There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees.             Results of Operation         Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.   We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.         Three and Six Months Periods Ended August 31, 2016 and 2015          Our net loss for the three and six months periods ended August 31, 2016 was $5,706 and $6,250 and net loss for the three and six months periods ended August 31, 2015 was $0. During the three and six months periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue.       The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,110,000 for the three and six months period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.               Liquidity and Capital Resources              11  |   Page         Three Months Period Ended August 31, 2016          As at August 31, 2016, our total assets were $1,150. Total assets were comprised of $1,150 in fixed assets (equipment purchase).  As at August 31, 2016 our current liabilities were $13,684. Stockholders    equity was $(12,534) as of August 31, 2016.                Cash Flows from Operating Activities         We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six months period ending August 31, 2016 net cash flows used in operating activities was $ 6,250 and for the three months period ending August 31, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $0.          Cash Flows from Investing Activities         We have not generated cash flows from investing activities for the period three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities     We have generated cash flows from financing activities for the period three months ended August 31, 2016 in the amount of $6,250 and we have not generated cash flows from financing activities for the period six months ending August 31, 2015.         Plan of Operation and Funding         We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.       Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next Three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing August not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we August not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements               12  |   Page        As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.         Going Concern         The independent auditors' review report accompanying our February 28, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.         ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.         No report required.             ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission   s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer   s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.       An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the Three-month period ended August 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                    PART II. OTHER INFORMATION              ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS         Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.             ITEM 2.
