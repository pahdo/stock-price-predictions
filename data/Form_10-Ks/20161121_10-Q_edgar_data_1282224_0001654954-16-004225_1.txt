SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 1   GENERAL 

Nature of Operations 

Dolphin
Digital Media, Inc. (the  Company, 
 Dolphin,   we,   us  or
 our ) is a producer of original high-quality digital
programming for online consumption and is committed to delivering
premium, best-in-class entertainment and securing premiere
distribution partners to maximize audience reach and commercial
advertising potential. Dolphin is also developing online kids
clubs. On March 7, 2016, the Company completed its merger with
Dolphin Films, Inc., an entity under common control. Dolphin Films,
Inc. ( Dolphin Films ) is a motion picture studio
focused on storytelling on a global scale for young,
always-connected audiences. 

Basis of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Dolphin, and all of its majority-owned and
controlled subsidiaries, including Dolphin Films, Inc., Hiding
Digital Productions, LLC, Dolphin Kids Clubs, LLC, Cybergeddon
Productions, LLC, Dolphin SB Productions LLC, Max Steel
Productions, LLC, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, Dolphin JB
Believe Financing, LLC and Dolphin JOAT Productions,
LLC 

Effective March 7,
2016, the Company acquired  Dolphin Films  from Dolphin
Entertainment, Inc. ( Dolphin Entertainment ), a
company wholly owned by William O Dowd, CEO, President,
Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder of Dolphin. The
acquisition from Dolphin Entertainment was a transfer between
entities under common control. As such, the Company recorded the
assets, liabilities and deficit of Dolphin Films on its
consolidated balance sheets at Dolphin Entertainment s
historical basis instead of fair value. Transfers of businesses
between entities under common control require prior periods to be
retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information.
Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements and related
notes of the Company have been retrospectively adjusted to include
the historical balances of Dolphin Entertainment prior to the
effective date of the acquisition. See Note 3 for additional
information regarding Dolphin Films acquisition. 

On May
9, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida
to effectuate a 20-to-1 reverse stock split. The reverse stock
split was approved by the Board of Directors and a majority of the
Company s shareholders and became effective May 10, 2016. The
number of common shares in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and all related footnotes has
been adjusted to retrospectively reflect the reverse stock
split. 

The
Company enters into relationships or investments with other
entities, and in certain instances, the entity in which the Company
has a relationship or investment may qualify as a variable interest
entity ( VIE ). A VIE is consolidated in the financial
statements if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary
of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power
to direct activities that most significantly impact the activities
of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to
benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the
VIE. The Company has included Max Steel Productions, LLC formed on
July 8, 2013 in the State of Florida and JB Believe, LLC formed on
December 4, 2012 in the State of Florida in its combined financial
statements as VIE s. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with United States ( U.S. )
generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for
interim financial information and the instructions to quarterly
report on Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), as amended, and Article 8 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s
management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
reflected in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. Operating results for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The balance
sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited
financial statements at that date, but does not include all the
information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read together with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015. 

6 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. The most significant estimates made by
management in the preparation of the financial statements relate to
ultimate revenue and costs for investment in digital and feature
film projects; estimates of sales returns and other allowances and
provisions for doubtful accounts and impairment assessments for
investment in digital and feature film projects. Actual results
could differ from such estimates. 

Restricted
Cash   

Restricted cash
represents amounts held as collateral required under the Company's
loan and security agreement. Proceeds from this loan were used for
the distribution and marketing costs of the Company's feature film.
See Note 5 for further discussion. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company maintained $1,250,000 in a separate bank account restricted
for this purpose.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
 FASB ) issued an accounting standards update on lease
accounting. This update requires lessees to put most leases on
their balance sheets. The new standard also requires new
disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the
amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The Accounting Standards Update (the  ASU ) will be
effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and
interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of
this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to
addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be
effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of
this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update of
consolidation of entities held by related parties under common
control. The update amends the consolidation guidance on how
variable interest entities should treat indirect interest in the
entity held through related parties. The ASU will be effective on a
retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new
guidance will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. which contemplate the continuation
of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred a net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $22,792,952.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an accumulated
deficit of $85,415,193. Further, the Company has a working capital
deficit of $32,884,818 and therefore does not have adequate capital
to fund its obligations as they come due or to maintain or develop
its operations. The Company is dependent upon funds from private
investors and support of certain stockholders. If the Company is
unable to obtain funding from these sources within the next 12
months, it could be forced to liquidate. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of these uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to
raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional
issuance of its common stock. There is no assurance that the
Company will be successful in raising additional capital. The
Company currently has the rights to several scripts that it intends
to obtain financing to produce and release during 2017. It expects
to earn a producer and overhead fee for each of these productions.
There can be no assurances that such productions will be released
or fees will be realized in future periods. The Company is
currently working on producing a variety of digital projects which
it intends to fund through private investors on a project basis and
expects to derive additional revenues from these productions in
2017. There can be no assurances that such income will be realized
in future periods.

NOTE
3   ACQUISITION OF DOLPHIN FILMS, INC. 

On
March 7, 2016, the Company, DDM Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida
corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
( Merger Subsidiary ), Dolphin Entertainment and
Dolphin Films completed their previously announced merger
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 14,
2015 (the  Merger Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary merged with and into
Dolphin Films (the  Merger ) with Dolphin Films
surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the Company
acquired Dolphin Films. At the effective time of the Merger, each
share of Dolphin Films  common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, issued and outstanding, was converted into the right to
receive the consideration for the Merger (the  Merger
Consideration ). The Company issued 2,300,000 shares of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share,
and 1,000,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par
value $0.001 per share to Dolphin Entertainment as the Merger
Consideration. 

William
O Dowd is the President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of the Company and, as of March 4, 2016, was the beneficial owner
of 52.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company,
par value $0.015 per share (the  Common Stock ). In
addition, Mr. O Dowd is the founder, president and sole
shareholder of Dolphin Entertainment, which is the sole shareholder
of Dolphin Films. The Merger Consideration was determined as a
result of negotiations between Dolphin Entertainment and a special
committee of independent directors of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the  Special Committee ), with the assistance
of separate financial and legal advisors selected and retained by
the Special Committee. The Special Committee unanimously determined
that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, were fair to and in the best
interests of the shareholders of the Company other than Mr.
O Dowd, and that it was advisable for the Company to enter
into the Merger Agreement. The Merger was consummated following the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
Company s shareholders.

Company retrospectively adjusted the historical financial results

NOTE
4   CAPITALIZED PRODUCTION COSTS, RECEIVABLES AND OTHER
CURRENT ASSETS 

Capitalized
production costs include the unamortized costs of completed web
series and feature films which have been produced by the Company
and costs of scripts for projects that have not been developed or
produced. These costs include direct production costs and
production overhead and are amortized using the
individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized
and participations and residuals costs are accrued in the
proportion that current year s revenue bears to
management s estimate of ultimate revenue at the beginning of
the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation,
exhibition or sale of the web series or feature film. 

In
April 2016, the Company began production of a new digital project
showcasing favorite restaurants of NFL players throughout the
country. The Company entered into a co-production agreement with an
unrelated party and is responsible for financing 50% of the
project s budget. Per the terms of the agreement, the Company
is entitled to 50% of the profits of the project, net of any
distribution fees. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company did not earn any revenues from web series and
for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the
Company earned revenues of $2,380,412. The Company had capitalized
production costs of $241,714 from web series as of September 30,
2016 and $2,439, (impaired during the nine months ended September
30, 2016) net of accumulated amortization, tax incentives and
impairment charges, as of December 31, 2015, recorded on its
consolidated condensed balance sheets. 

The
Company completed production of a motion picture during the year
ended December 31, 2014 with post production being completed during
the second quarter of 2015. The Company released the film
domestically October 14, 2016. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company earned revenues from its motion
picture business of $1,140,000 and $1,144,157, respectively. This
revenue was attributable to the delivery of this motion picture to
various international distributors pursuant to existing licensing
agreements. During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, it earned $13,071 and $33,584 from a film released in
December 2013. The Company amortized capitalized production costs
(included as direct costs) in the combined statements of operations
using the individual film forecast computation method in the amount
of $1,106,229 for each of the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016. $9,488 and $30,001, respectively were amortized for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $13,787,100 and
$14,896,389, respectively of capitalized production costs related
to these motion pictures. 

11 

In
addition, the Company has purchased scripts, including one from a
related party, for other motion picture productions and has
recorded $290,000 and $275,000 in capitalized production costs as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
associated with these scripts. The Company intends to produce these
projects but they were not yet in production as of September 30,
2016. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company
has total capitalized production costs of $14,318,814 and
$15,170,768, net of accumulated amortization, tax incentives and
impairment charges, recorded on its condensed consolidated balance
sheets. 

On
October 14, 2016, the Company released its motion picture
  Max Steel  
(the  Film ) in the US. The Film did not perform as
well as expected and the Company is assessing whether the fair
value of the film is less than the unamortized capitalized costs.
ASU 2012-07 states that the events arising after the measurement
date, that would not have been kown by market participants on the
measurement date, do not have to be taken into account when
preparing an impairment analysis. The Company considers evidence
that exists during each reporting period and subsequent periods to
assess what information market participants may have considered at
the balance sheet date. The film was released subsequent to
September 30, 2016, and as such, box office performance would not
have been known by market participants. Furthermore, the Company
considered other information such as distributor box office
estimates as of September 23, 2016, and did not identify any
impairment indicators as of September 30, 2016. The Company will
record any impairment in the unamortized capitalized costs of the
Film in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Receivable and Other Current Assets 

The
Company recorded $3,969,758 and $2,827,131 in receivables and other
current assets on its consolidated balance sheets as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These amounts were
primarily comprised of receivables from advertising revenue sharing
from its production, receivable from international license
agreements, subscription receivable and receivables of tax
incentives. For the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
completed delivery of film assets as required by certain
international license agreements for its feature film and recorded
a receivable of $891,459 related to these contracts. Tax incentives
earned with respect to expenditures on qualifying film productions
are included as an offset to capitalized production costs when the
qualifying expenditures have been incurred provided that there is
reasonable assurance that the credits will be
realized. 

NOTE
5   DEBT 

Kids Club Agreements 

During
February 2011, the Company entered into two agreements with
individual parties (each a  Kids Club Agreement ) for
the development of a child fan club for the promotion of a local
university and its collegiate athletic program (the  Group
Kids Club ). Under each Kids Club Agreement, each party paid
the Company $50,000 in return for the participation of future
revenue generated by the Group Kids Club. Pursuant to the terms of
each of the Kids Club Agreements, the amount invested by the
individual investor was to be repaid by the Group Kids Club, with a
specified percentage of the Group Kids Club s net receipts,
until the total investment was recouped. Each individual party was
to recoup its investment with a percentage of net revenue based
upon a fraction, the numerator of which was the amount invested
($50,000), and the denominator of which was $500,000 (the
 Investment Ratio ). Thereafter, each individual party
would share in a percentage of the net revenue of the Group Kids
Club, in an amount equal to one half of the Investment Ratio. As of
June 30, 2016, the Company had made aggregate payments of $45,000
under one of the two Kids Clubs Agreements. On July 1, 2016, the
Company agreed to terminate such Kids Club Agreement for (i)
$10,000, plus (ii) the balance of the original investment ($5,000).

additional revenues. The Equity Finance Agreements stated that
prior to December 31, 2012, the Company could utilize all, or any
portion, of the total equity investment to fund any chosen
production. Per the Equity Finance Agreements, the Company was
entitled to a producer s fee, not to exceed $250,000, for

to date, the Company was not required to pay the investors any
amount in excess of the existing liability already recorded as of

NOTE
11   VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

VIEs
are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have
equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant
decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting
rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses
or the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The
most common type of VIE is a special-purpose entity
( SPE ). SPEs are commonly used in securitization
transactions in order to isolate certain assets, and distribute the
cash flows from those assets to investors. The legal documents that
govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets
must be allocated to the SPE s investors and other parties
that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured
to insulate investors from claims on the SPE s, assets by
creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller
of the assets. 

The
primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets
and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party
that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of an entity
that most significantly impact the VIE s economic
performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from
the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess
whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE s economic
performance, the Company considers all the facts and circumstances,
including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights
and responsibilities. 

To
assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses or
the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially
be significant to the VIE, the Company considers all of its
economic interests, including debt and equity investments,
servicing fees, and derivative or other arrangements deemed to be
variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the
Company apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in
the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the
VIE. 

The
Company performs ongoing reassessments of (1) whether entities
previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework
have become VIEs, based on certain triggering events, and therefore
would be subject to the VIE consolidation framework, and (2)
whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the
Company s involvement with a VIE cause the Company s
consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of the
VIEs with which the Company is involved may change as a result of
such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied
prospectively with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated
VIE initially recorded at fair value unless the VIE is an entity
which was previously under common control, which in that case is
consolidated based historical cost. A gain or loss may be
recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying
amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the
fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual
arrangements. 

18 

The
Company evaluated certain entities of which it did not have a
majority voting interest and determined that it had (1) the power
to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly
impact their economic performance and (2) had the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from these entities.
As such the financial statements of Max Steel Productions, LLC and

Stock 

The
Company s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has
the power to designate the rights and preferences of the preferred
stock and issue the preferred stock in one or more
series. 

On
October 14, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation
to designate 4,000,000 preferred shares, as  Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock  with a $0.10 par value. Each
share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at
the holders request, into nineteen shares of Common Stock. Holders
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock do not have any voting
rights. 

On

Squared") entered into a Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement whereby

On
February 23, 2016, the Company amended its Articles of
Incorporation to designate 1,000,000 preferred shares as
 Series C Convertible Preferred Stock  with a $0.001
par value. The certificate of designation of the Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Certificate of
Designation ) provides that each share of Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock will be exercisable into one share of
Common Stock. Until the fifth anniversary of the date of the
issuance, the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will have
certain anti-dilution protections as provided in the Certificate of
Designation. Specifically, the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will be
converted (the  Conversion Number ) will be adjusted
for each future issuance of Common Stock (but not upon issuance of
Common Stock equivalents) (i) upon the conversion or exercise of
any instrument currently or hereafter issued (but not upon the
conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock), (ii) upon
the exchange of debt for shares of Common Stock, or (iii) in a
private placement, such that the total number of shares of Common
Stock held by an  Eligible Series C Preferred Holder 
(based on the number of shares of Common Stock held as of the date
of issuance) will be preserved at the same percentage of shares of
common stock outstanding currently held by such persons, which
currently is approximately 53% of the shares of the Company s
Common Stock outstanding. An Eligible Class C Preferred Stock
Holder means any of (i) Dolphin Entertainment for so long as Mr.
O Dowd continues to beneficially own at least 90% of Dolphin
Entertainment and serves on the board of directors or other
governing body of Dolphin Entertainment, (ii) any other entity in
which Mr. O Dowd beneficially owns more than 90%, or a trust
for the benefit of others but for which Mr. O Dowd serves as
trustee and (iii) Mr. O Dowd individually. The shares of
Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert
into the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion
Number in effect at that time ( Conversion Shares )
upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) upon
transfer of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to any holder
other than an Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder, (ii) if the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock plus Conversion Shares
(issuable upon conversion of each share of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock and the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock) held
by the Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holders in the aggregate
constitutes 10% or less of the sum of (x) the outstanding shares of
Common Stock plus (y) all Conversion Shares held by the Eligible
Class C Preferred Stock Holders and (iii) at such time as the
holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock ceases to be an
Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder. Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock will only be convertible by the holder upon the
Company satisfying certain  optional conversion
thresholds  as provided in the Certificate of Designation.
The Certificate of Designation also provides for a liquidation
value of $0.001 per share. The holders of Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock and Common Stock will vote together as a single
class on all matters upon which the Common Stock is entitled to
vote, except as otherwise required by law. The holders of Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to three votes for
each share of Common Stock into which such holders  shares of
Series C Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted. The
Certificate of Designation also provides for dividend rights of the
Series C Convertible Preferred Stock on parity with the
Company s Common Stock.

C. Noncontrolling
Interest 

On May

during the year ended December 31, 2012 for a 25% membership
interest in the newly formed entity. The Company holds the
remaining 75% and thus controlling interest in Dolphin Kids Clubs.
The purpose of Dolphin Kids Clubs is to create and operate online
kids clubs for selected charitable, educational and civic
organizations. The agreement encompasses kids clubs created between
January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. It is a  gross revenue
agreement  and the Company will be responsible for paying all
associated operating expenses. Revenues from Dolphin Kids Clubs
attributable to the noncontrolling interest were $1,556 and $6,813,
respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and $11,250 and $15,253 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, respectively. Per the terms of the operating
agreement, the revenues of the kids clubs are distributed equally
to the members until the noncontrolling member has received
$3,000,000 in revenues. Based on the revenues earned from the kids
clubs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded in other current liabilities $13,626 attributable to the
noncontrolling member. 

In
accordance with ASC 810-20, Dolphin Kids Clubs is consolidated in
the Company s financial statements. Amounts attributable to
the noncontrolling interest will follow the provisions in the
contractual arrangement. Noncontrolling interest is presented as a
separate component of shareholders  equity. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a
noncontrolling interest of $2,970,996 and $2,977,808 respectively
on its consolidated balance sheets for the 25% interest in Dolphin
Kids Clubs. 

NOTE
13   LOSS PER SHARE 

Net
loss per share is computed by dividing income available to holders
of Common Stock (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of
Common Stock outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted
earnings per share assumes that any dilutive convertible securities
outstanding were converted, with related preferred stock dilution
requirements and outstanding Common Stock adjusted accordingly. In
periods of losses, diluted loss per share is computed on the same
basis as basic loss per share as the inclusion of any other
potential shares outstanding would be anti-dilutive. The Company
included the preferred stock dividend of $4,284,494 in the
calculation of loss per share for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, as the loss for holders of Common Stock would be
increased by that amount. Due to the net losses reported dilutive
common equivalent shares were excluded from the computation of
diluted loss per share, as inclusion would be anti-dilutive for the
periods presented.

NOTE
14   WARRANTS

months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:

months ended September 30, 2016 to reduce the exercise price of the

NOTE
16   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Litigation 

On or
about January 25, 2010, an action was filed by Tom David against
Winterman Group Limited, Dolphin Digital Media (Canada) Ltd.,
Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale in the Superior Court of
Justice in Ontario (Canada) alleging breach of a commercial lease
and breach of a personal guaranty. On or about March 18, 2010,
Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale filed
a Statement of Defense and Crossclaim. In the Statement of Defense,
Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale
denied any liability under the lease and guaranty. In the
Crossclaim filed against Dolphin Digital Media (Canada) Ltd.,
Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale seek
contribution or indemnity against Dolphin Digital Media (Canada)
Ltd. alleging that Dolphin Digital Media (Canada) agreed to relieve
Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale from
any and all liability with respect to the lease or the guaranty. On
or about March 19, 2010, Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale
and Sara Stockdale filed a Third Party Claim against the Company
seeking contribution or indemnity against the Company, formerly
known as Logica Holdings, Inc., alleging that the Company agreed to
relieve Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara
Stockdale from any and all liability with respect to the lease or
the guaranty. The Third Party Claim was served on the Company on
April 6, 2010. On or about April 1, 2010, Dolphin Digital Media
(Canada) filed a Statement of Defense and Crossclaim. In the
Statement of Defense, Dolphin Digital Media (Canada) denied any
liability under the lease and in the Crossclaim against Winterman
Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale, Dolphin
Digital Media (Canada) seeks contribution or indemnity against
Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale
alleging that the leased premises were used by Winterman Group
Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara Stockdale for their own use. On
or about April 1, 2010, Dolphin Digital Media (Canada) also filed a
Statement of Defense to the Crossclaim denying any liability to
indemnify Winterman Group Limited, Malcolm Stockdale and Sara
Stockdale. The ultimate results of these proceedings against the
Company cannot be predicted with certainty. On or about March 12,
2012, the Court served a Status Notice on all the parties
indicating that since more than (2) years had passed since a
defense in the action had been filed, the case had not been set for
trial and the case had not been terminated, the case would be
dismissed for delay unless action was taken within ninety (90) days
of the date of service of the notice. The Company has not filed for
a motion to dismiss and no further action has been taken in the
case. The ultimate results of these proceedings against the Company
could result in a loss ranging from 0 to $325,000. On March 23,
2012, Dolphin Digital Media (Canada) Ltd filed for bankruptcy in
Canada. The bankruptcy will not protect the Company from the Third
Party Claim filed against it. However, the Company has not accrued
for this loss because it believes that the claims against it are
without substance and it is not probable that they will result in
loss. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not received any
other notifications related to this action. 

Tax Filings 

For the
year ended December 31, 2011, the Company accrued $120,000 for
estimated penalties associated with not filing certain information
returns. The penalties per return are $10,000 per entity per year.
The Company received notification from the Internal Revenue Service
concerning information returns for the year ended December 31,
2009. The Company responded with a letter stating reasonable cause
for the noncompliance and requested that penalties be abated.
During 2012, the Company received a notice stating that the
reasonable cause had been denied. The Company decided to pay the
penalties and not appeal the decision for the 2009 Internal Revenue
Service notification. There is no associated interest expense as
the tax filings are for information purposes only and would not
result in further income taxes to be paid by the Company. The
Company made payments in the amount of $40,000 during the year
ended December 31, 2012 related to these penalties. At each of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a
remainder of $40,000 in accruals related to these late filing
penalties and is presented as a component of other current
liabilities.

February 2012, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with

a two-year period once the website was delivered. The Company
expensed the payments since it cannot reasonably estimate future
cash flows or revenues from the website development. 

In
January 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with a
worldwide philanthropic organization to create an online kids club
to promote the organizations philanthropic philosophy and encourage
literacy programs. Effective July 1, 2015, the two parties agreed
to amend and restate the agreement. The agreement is for a period
of three years from the effective date and will automatically renew
for successive terms of three years unless terminated by either
party with written notice at least 180 day prior to the expiration
of the initial or any subsequent term. The Company is responsible
for the creation and marketing of the website, developing and
managing the sponsorship package, and hiring of certain employees
to administer the program. Each school sponsorship package is
$10,000 with the Company earning $1,250. The remaining funds are
used for program materials and the costs of other partners. On July
1, 2016, the Company and United Way Worldwide mutually agreed to
terminate the agreement. The Company intends to continue promoting
the online kids club with the remaining partners and it does not
anticipate any material change in the operations of the online kids
club. 

The
Company recorded revenues of $6,225 and $27,253 during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $45,000 and $61,011
respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, related to these agreements. 

Incentive Compensation Plan 

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company s Board of
Directors approved an Incentive Compensation Plan. The plan was
enacted as a way of attracting and retaining exceptional employees
and consultants by enabling them to share in the long term growth
and financial success of the Company. The plan will be administered
by the Board of Directors or a committee designated by the board.
As part of an increase in authorized shares approved by the Board
of Directors in 2012, 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock were
designated for this plan. No awards have been issued and, as such,
the Company has not recorded any liability or equity related to
this plan as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. 

Talent, Director and Producer Participations 

Per
agreements with talent, directors and producer s on certain
projects, the Company will be responsible for bonus and back end
payments upon release of a motion picture and achieving certain box
office performance as determined by the individual agreements. The
Company cannot estimate the amounts that will be due as these are
based on future box office performance. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company had not recorded any liability
related to these participations.

ITEM 2.     
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OVERVIEW 

Dolphin
Digital Media, Inc. specializes in the production and distribution
of online digital content. We also seek to develop online kids
clubs. On October 14, 2015, we and DDM Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly
owned subsidiary, entered into a merger agreement with Dolphin
Films, Inc. ("Dolphin Films") and Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.
("Dolphin Entertainment"), both entities owned by a related party.
The merger was approved by a majority of our shareholders on
February 22, 2016 at our annual meeting. On March 7, 2016, pursuant
to the merger agreement, Merger Subsidiary merged with and into
Dolphin Films with Dolphin Films surviving the merger. As a result
of the merger, we acquired Dolphin Films, a content producer in the
motion picture industry. As consideration for the merger, we issued
2,300,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and
1,000,000 shares of newly designated Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock to Dolphin Entertainment. The following management discussion
is based on financial information that has been retrospectively
adjusted as if the merger had occurred from the first date of
financial information presented. All financial information has been
retrospectively adjusted at the historical values of Dolphin Films,
as the merger was between entities under common
control. 

On May
9, 2016, we filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida
to effectuate a 1-to-20 reverse stock split. The reverse stock
split was effective as of May 10, 2016. The reverse stock split was
approved by our Board of Directors and a majority of our
shareholders. Shares of Common Stock, par value, $0.01 per share
("Common Stock"), have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the
reverse stock split in the following management
discussion. 

Revenues 

We
currently derive revenue through (i) the online distribution of web
series produced and distributed by Dolphin Digital Studios, our
digital entertainment division; (ii) international distribution of
motion pictures produced by Dolphin Films, our newly-acquired film
division and (iii) a portion of fees obtained from the sale of
memberships to online kids clubs. The table below sets forth the
components of revenue for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our primary
sources of revenue were from (i) the sale of international
distribution rights of a feature film released domestically on
October 14, 2016 and (ii) revenue from the sale of memberships to
online kids clubs. By contrast, our primary source of revenue
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was from
(i) the online distribution of a web series and (ii) revenue from
the sale of memberships to online kids clubs. 

Dolphin Digital Studios 

In
April 2016, we entered into a co-production agreement to produce a
digital project that showcases favorite restaurants of NFL players.
The show was produced during the second quarter throughout several
cities in the US and we anticipate that it will be available for
distribution in early 2017. We are currently sourcing distribution
platforms in which to release projects currently in production and
those for which we have the rights   and which we intend
to produce. We earn production and online distribution revenue
solely through the following: 

Producer s
Fees:   We earn fees for
producing each web series, as included in the production budget for
each project.   
   We either recognize
producer s fees on a percentage of completion or a completed
contract basis depending on the terms of the producer agreements,
which we negotiate on a project by project basis. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we began production of our new web
series but it had not been completed. In addition, we concentrated
our efforts in identifying potential distribution partners. Some of
our current agreements with   financing sources permit us to earn up to a
$250,000 producer   s   fee
for each web series  .  

28 

Initial
Distribution/  Advertising
Revenue  : We earn revenues from
the distribution of online content on advertising based video on
demand ( AVOD ) platforms.   Distribution   agreements contain revenue sharing provisions
which permit the producer to retain   a percentage   of all domestic and international advertising
revenue generated from the online distribution of a particular web
series  . Typically, these rates
range from 30% to 45% of such revenue  . We have previously distributed our productions
on various online platforms including Yahoo! and Facebook and most
recently Hulu, where we distributed our web series, 
  South Beach
- Fever    during the third
and fourth quarters of 2015.  

Secondary 
 Distribution
Revenue  : Once our contractual
obligation with the initial online distribution platform expires,
we have the ability to derive revenues from distributions of the
web series in ancillary markets such as DVD, television and
subscription video on demand ( SVOD ). No revenues from
this source have been derived during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We intend to source potential
secondary distribution partners for our web series, 
  South Beach
- Fever    once our
agreement with the initial distributor expires.  

Dolphin Films 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
derived revenues primarily through the international distribution
of our motion pictures titled  Believe  and  Max
Steel . 

The
production of the motion picture titled  Max Steel  was
completed during 2015. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
we obtained the financing necessary for the distribution and
marketing costs and the motion picture was released domestically on
October 14, 2016. The motion picture did not perform as well as
expected domestically but we have secured approximately $9 million
in international distribution agreements. We consider evidence that
exists during each reporting period and subsequent periods to
assess what information market participants may have considered at
the balance sheet date. The film was released subsequent to
September 30, 2016, and as such, box office performance would not
have been known by market participants. Furthermore, we considered
other information such as distributor box office estimates as of
September 23, 2016, and did not identify any impairment indicators.
Impairment indicators were not apparent until after the domestic
release of the film and any impairment will be recorded during the
fourth quarter of 2016.    We are performing
an impairment analysis to determine if the fair value of the film
is below the capitalized production costs.  Revenues from
this motion picture are expected to be generated from the following
sources: 

Theatrical 
   Theatrical revenues are
expected to be derived from the domestic theatrical release of
motion pictures licensed to a U.S. theatrical distributor that has
existing agreements with theatrical exhibitors. The financial terms
negotiated with its U.S. theatrical distributor provide that we
receive a percentage of the box office results, after related
distribution fees.  

International 
   International revenues are
expected to be derived through license agreements with
international distributors to distribute our motion pictures in an
agreed upon territory for an agreed upon time. Several of the
international distribution agreements were contingent on a domestic
wide release that occurred on October 14, 2016.  

Other 
   Dolphin Films  U.S.
theatrical distributor has existing output arrangements for the
distribution of productions to home entertainment, video on demand
( VOD ), pay-per-view ( PPV ), electronic
sell-through ( EST ), subscription based video on
demand ( SVOD ) and free and pay television markets.
The revenues expected to be derived from these channels are based
on the performance of the motion picture in the domestic box
office. We anticipate the revenues from these channels will be
received in 2017 or thereafter.   

Project Development and Related Services 

We have
a development team that dedicates a portion of its time and
resources to sourcing scripts for future developments. The scripts
can be for either digital or motion picture productions. During
2015, we acquired the rights to a script for a motion picture that
we intend to produce in early 2017. We also identified and acquired
two other scripts that we believe would appeal to one of our target
demographics. We have not yet determined if these projects would be
produced for digital or theatrical distribution. 

29 

Online Kids Clubs 

We
partnered with US Youth Soccer, in 2012, and United Way Worldwide,
in 2013, to create online kids clubs. Our online kids clubs derive
revenue from the sale of memberships in the online kids clubs to
various individuals and organizations. We share in a portion of the
membership fees as outlined in our agreements with the various
entities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we
terminated, by mutual accord the agreement with United Way
Worldwide. We have retained the trademark to the online kids club
and will continue to operate the site. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not record
significant revenues from the online kids clubs. We operate our
online kids club activities through our subsidiary, Dolphin Kids
Clubs, LLC ( Dolphin Kids Clubs ). We own 75% of
Dolphin Kids Clubs and the other 25% is owned by a former note
holder who agreed to convert $1.5 million aggregate principal
amount of an outstanding note into equity of Dolphin Kids Clubs and
made additional capital contributions of $1.5 million during the
year ended December 31, 2012. The agreement encompasses kids clubs
created between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. It is a
 gross revenue agreement  and we are responsible for
paying all associated operating expenses. Net income is
attributable to each member based on the thresholds established in
the operating agreement of the entity. 

Expenses 

Our
expenses consist primarily of (1) direct costs, (2) distribution
and marketing (3) selling, general and administrative expenses (4)
payroll expenses and (5) legal and professional fees. 

Direct
costs include amortization of deferred production costs, impairment
of deferred production costs, residuals and other costs associated
with production. Residuals represent amounts payable to various
unions or  guilds  such as the Screen Actors Guild,
Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America, based on
the performance of the digital production in certain ancillary
markets. Included within direct costs are immaterial impairments
for any of our projects. Capitalized production costs are recorded
at the lower of their cost, less accumulated amortization and tax
incentives, or fair value. If estimated remaining revenue is not
sufficient to recover the unamortized capitalized production costs
for that title, the unamortized capitalized production costs will
be written down to fair value. Material impairments would be
recorded as a separate item on our statement of
operations. 

Distribution and
marketing expenses include the costs of theatrical  prints
and advertising  ( P A ) and of DVD/Blu-ray
duplication and marketing. Theatrical P A includes the costs of
the theatrical prints delivered to theatrical exhibitors and the
advertising and marketing cost associated with the theatrical
release of the picture. DVD/Blu-ray duplication represents the cost
of the DVD/Blu-ray product and the manufacturing costs associated
with creating the physical products. DVD/Blu-ray marketing costs
represent the cost of advertising the product at or near the time
of its release. 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses include all overhead costs except for
payroll and legal and professional fees that are reported as a
separate expense item. Included within selling, general and
administrative expenses are the commissions that we pay our
advertising and distribution brokers, which can range up to 25% of
the distribution and advertising revenue that we
receive. 

Legal
and professional fees include fees paid to our attorneys, fees for
public relations consultants, fees for general business consultants
and fees paid to our sales agent for back office
services. 

Other Income and Expenses 

Other
income and expenses consist primarily of (i) interest payments to
Dolphin Entertainment, an entity owned by our CEO, in connection
with loans made to the Company; (ii) interest payments related to
the Loan and Security Agreements entered into to finance the
production of certain digital content and motion pictures (iii)
loss on extinguishment of debt and (iv) amortization of loan fees.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we entered into
agreements with certain debtholders, including Dolphin
Entertainment, to convert an aggregate of $23,508,267 principal and
interest into 4,701,654 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00
per share. The conversions occurred on days when the market price
of the stock was between $6.00 and $6.99 per share. As a result, we
recorded a loss on the extinguishment of the debt of approximately
$5.8 million. 

30 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenues 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated
revenue from (i) international distribution rights of our motion
picture,  Max Steel  and (ii) portion of fees obtained
from the sale of memberships to online kids clubs. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated our revenue
primarily from (i) online distribution of our web series,
 South Beach   Fever  and (ii) portion of fees
obtained from the sale of memberships to online kids
clubs. 

Revenues from
production and distribution decreased by $1.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in
the prior year primarily due to the recognition of the majority of
the revenue from the online distribution of our web series,
 South Beach   Fever  in 2015. During the same
period in 2016, we derived revenues from distribution to a few
international territories of the motion picture  Max
Steel , pursuant to the license agreements. The motion
picture was released in the U.S. on October 14, 2016 and we expect
to derive additional revenues in 2016 from the domestic release and
international distribution agreements. 

Revenues from
membership fees decreased by $0.03 million, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in the
prior year as a result of one individual that adopted a group of
schools in Louisiana during the second quarter of
2015. 

31 

Expenses 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our
primary operating expenses were direct costs, distribution and
marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses, legal and
professional fees and payroll expenses. 

Direct
costs decreased by approximately $0.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in the
prior year mainly due to a fee paid to our distributor in 2015
related to the release date of our motion picture and the
amortization of capitalized production costs of our web
series. 

Distribution and
marketing expenses increased by approximately $9.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
in the prior year mainly due to costs associated with the
distribution and marketing for the release of our motion picture,
 Max Steel . 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million
and decreased by $0.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in
the prior year. The increase in the three months is mainly due to
certain fees paid to the Writers Guild of America for pension and
health costs of writer s that were hired to develop scripts.
The decrease in the nine months is mainly due to marketing and
consulting fees incurred in 2015 related to our motion picture,
 Max Steel , and decrease in travel mainly due to the
completion of our film. 

Legal
and professional expenses decreased by approximately $0.1 million
and $0.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior
year. The decrease is primarily due to the expiration in December
of 2015 of a certain contract for international distribution back
office service and the termination of an agreement with a related
party for producer services. 

Payroll
expenses increased by approximately $0.03 million and $0.07
million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year
mostly due to certain payroll costs capitalized during the
production of our web series in 2015and cost of living salary
increases made at the beginning of 2016. 

32 

Other
Income and expenses 

Interest expense
increased by $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year and was
directly related to $12.5 million in loan and security agreements
that we entered into during 2015 for our film division. In
addition, we entered into additional loan and security agreements
for our digital business in the amount of $1.3 million. Each of
these agreements bears interest of up to 12% per annum. Interest
expense decreased by approximately $0.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last
year due to certain loan and security agreements that were
converted into shares of our common stock as discussed
below. 

On
March 29, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company entered into eleven
individual debt exchange agreements with parties to loan and
security agreements under which it issued promissory notes to each
of the parties. Pursuant to the terms of the debt exchange
agreements, the Company converted an aggregate $2,650,000 of
principal and $289,017 of accrued interest under the promissory
notes into an aggregate of 587,804 shares of Common Stock at a
post- split price of $5.00 per share as payment in full of each of
the promissory notes. The post-split market price per share for
576,676 shares of Common Stock (on a post-split basis) at
conversion was $6.00. For the remaining 11,128 shares of Common
Stock, the market price per share of Common Stock at conversion was
$6.08. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment
of debt on its consolidated statement of operations of $588,694 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to this
transaction. 

On
March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a subscription agreement
with Dolphin Entertainment. Pursuant to the terms of the
subscription agreement, the Company converted $3,073,410 of
principal and interest outstanding on a revolving promissory note
into 614,682 shares of Common Stock (on a post-split basis) at a
post-split price of $5.00 per share. At conversion, the post-split
market price per share of Common Stock was $6.00. As a result, the
Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $614,682
on its condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

On May
31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company entered into thirteen
individual debt exchange agreements with parties to loan and
security agreements under which it issued promissory notes to each
of the parties. Pursuant to the debt exchange agreements, the

accrued interest under the promissory notes into an aggregate of
3,499,168 shares of Common Stock at a price of $5.00 per share as
payment in full of each of the promissory notes. On May 31, 2016
and June 30, 2016, the market price per share of Common Stock was
$6.99 and $6.08, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded a
loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4,640,425 on its condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.

months ended September 30, 2015 based on 4,094,618 weighted average
shares outstanding as of September 30, 2015. Net losses for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
related to the factors discussed above. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash
Flows 

Cash
flows used in operating activities increased by approximately $9.5
million from approximately $(6.1) million used during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $(15.6) million
used during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase
was primarily due to $9.2 million used during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 for distribution and marketing costs for the
release of our motion picture,  Max
Steel . 

33 

Cash
flows from financing activities increased by approximately $7.7
million from approximately $6.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to approximately $14.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to
financing for the distribution and marketing costs for the release
of our motion picture. In addition, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we entered into various subscription agreements
for the sale of our common stock for a total of $6.2 million. In
comparison, during the same period in prior year, we received $4.5
million more of advances from our CEO. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cash available for working
capital of approximately $1.0 million and approximately $0.8
million, respectively, and a working capital deficit of
approximately $32.9 million and approximately $14.4 million,
respectively. 

These
factors, along with an accumulated deficit of $85.4 million, raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to raise any
necessary additional funds through loans and additional issuance of
its common stock. There is no assurance that the Company will be
successful in raising additional capital. The Company currently has
the rights to several scripts that it intends to obtain financing
to produce and release during 2017. It will earn a producer and
overhead fee for each of these productions. There can be no
assurances that such productions will be released or fees will be
realized in future periods. We expect to begin to generate cash
flows from our other sources of revenue, including the distribution
of at least one web series that, as discussed earlier has gone into
production. 

Financing
Arrangements 

Kids Club Agreements 

During
February 2011, we entered into two agreements with individual
parties (each a  Kids Club Agreement ) for the
development of a child fan club for the promotion of a local
university and its collegiate athletic program (the  Group
Kids Club ). Under each Kids Club Agreement, each party paid
us $50,000 in return for the participation of future revenue
generated by the Group Kids Club. Pursuant to the terms of each of
the Kids Club Agreements, the amount invested by the individual
investor was to be repaid by the Group Kids Club, with a specified
percentage of the Group Kids Club s net receipts, until the
total investment was recouped. Each individual party was to recoup
its investment with a percentage of net revenue based upon a
fraction, the numerator of which was the amount invested ($50,000),
and the denominator of which was $500,000 (the  Investment
Ratio ). Thereafter, each individual party would share in a
percentage of the net revenue of the Group Kids Club, in an amount
equal to one half of the Investment Ratio. As of June 30, 2016, we
had made aggregate payments of $45,000 under one of the two Kids
Clubs Agreements. On July 1, 2016, we agreed to terminate such Kids
Club Agreement for (i) $10,000, plus (ii) the balance of the
original investment ($5,000). We paid such individual party $15,000
on July 18, 2016 in full settlement of its obligations under such
Kids Club Agreement, and the Kids Club Agreement for such party was
terminated. As of September 30, 2016 there is only one Kids Club
Agreement outstanding. On October 3, 2016, we entered into a debt
exchange agreement and agreed to issue 12,000 shares of the
Company s common stock at an exchange price of $5.00 per
share to terminate the remaining Kids Club Agreement for (i)
$10,000 plus (ii) the original investment of $50,000. 

Equity Finance Agreements 

During
the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we entered into Equity
Finance Agreements (the  Equity Finance Agreements )
for the future production of web series and the option to
participate in the production of future web series. The investors
contributed a total equity investment of $1,000,000 and had the
ability to share in the future revenues of the relevant web series,
on a prorate basis, until the total equity investment was recouped
and then would have shared at a lower percentage of the additional
revenues. The Equity Finance Agreements stated that prior to
December 31, 2012, we could utilize all, or any portion, of the
total equity investment to fund any chosen production. Per the
Equity Finance Agreements, we were entitled to a producer s
fee, not to exceed $250,000, for each web series that it produced
before calculating the share of revenues owed to the investors. We
invested these funds in eleven projects. On January 1, 2013, the
production  cycle  ceased and the investors were
entitled to share in the future revenues of any productions for
which the funds invested were used. Based on the gross
producer s revenues for the productions to date and the
amount of investor funds used to date, we were not required to pay
the investors any amount in excess of the existing liability
already recorded as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Two of the productions were completed as of September 30, 2016 and
there was no producer gross revenue as defined in the Equity
Finance Agreements for each of the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The remaining projects were impaired
and there are no future projects planned with funds from the Equity
Finance Agreements. 

34 

On June
23, 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement (the
 Settlement ) with one of the investors that had
originally contributed $0.1 million. Pursuant to the terms of the
Settlement, we made a payment of $0.2 million to the investor on
June 24, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the total equity
investment remaining under the Equity Finance Agreements was $0.9
million. On October 3, 2016 and October 13, 2016, we entered into
debt exchange agreements with several investors to issue 66,200
shares of our common stock at an exchange price of $5.00 per share
to terminate three Equity Finance Agreements for a cumulative
original investment amount of $0.3 million. 

Loan
and Security Agreements 

First Group Film Funding 

During
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we entered into various
loan and security agreements with individual noteholders (the
 First Loan and Security Noteholders ) for an aggregate
principal amount of notes of $11,945,219 to finance future motion
picture projects (the  First Loan and Security
Agreements ). During the year ended December 31, 2015, one of
the First Loan and Security Noteholders increased its funding under
its respective First Loan and Security Agreement for an additional
$500,000 investment and we used the proceeds to repay $405,219 to
another First Loan and Security Noteholder. Pursuant to the terms
of the First Loan and Security Agreements, we issued notes that
accrued interest at rates ranging from 11.25% to 12% per annum,
payable monthly through June 30, 2015. During 2015, we exercised
our option under the First Loan and Security Agreements, to extend
the maturity date of these notes until December 31, 2016. In
consideration our exercise of the option to extend the maturity
date, we were required to pay a higher interest rate, increasing
1.25% to a range between 12.50% and 13.25%. The First Loan and
Security Noteholders, as a group, will receive our entire share of
the proceeds from these projects, on a prorata basis, until the
principal investment is repaid. Thereafter, the First Loan and
Security Noteholders, as a group, would have the right to
participate in 15% of our future profits from these projects
(defined as our gross revenues of such projects less the aggregate
amount of principal and interest paid for the financing of such
projects) on a prorata basis based on each First Loan and Security
Noteholder's loan commitment as a percentage of the total loan
commitments received to fund specific motion picture
productions. 

On May
31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we entered into various debt exchange
agreements on substantially similar terms with certain of the First
Loan and Security Noteholders to convert an aggregate of $11.3
million of principal and $1.8 million of accrued interest into
shares of Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of such debt exchange
agreements, we agreed to convert the debt at $5.00 per share and
issued 2,630,298 shares of Common Stock. On May 31, 2016 the market
price of a share of Common Stock was $6.99 and on June 30, 2016 it
was $6.08. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of
debt on our consolidated statement of operations of $3.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

We
anticipate that additional debt under the First Loan and Security
Agreements may be exchanged for shares of Common Stock 
 in the
near future. 

Web Series Funding 

During
the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we entered into various
loan and security agreements with individual noteholders (the
 Web Series Noteholders ) for an aggregate principal
amount of notes of $4.0 million which we used to finance production
of our 2015 web series (the  Web Series Loan and Security
Agreements ). Under the Web Series Loan and Security
Agreements, we issued promissory notes that accrued interest at
rates ranging from 10% to 12% per annum payable monthly through
August 31, 2015, with the exception of one note that accrued
interest through February 29, 2016. During 2015, we exercised our
option under the Web Series Loan and Security Agreements to extend
the maturity date of these notes until August 31, 2016. In
consideration for our exercise of the option to extend the maturity
date, we were required to pay a higher interest rate, increasing
1.25% to a range between 11.25% and 13.25%. Pursuant to the terms
of the Web Series Loan and Security Agreements, the First Loan and
Security Noteholders, as a group, would have the right to
participate in 15% of our future profits generated by the series
(defined as our gross revenues of such series less the aggregate
amount of principal and interest paid for the financing of such
series) on a prorata basis based on each Web Series Noteholder's
loan commitment as a percentage of the total loan commitments
received to fund the series. 

On
March 29, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we entered into eleven individual
debt exchange agreements (the  Web Series Debt Exchange
Agreements ) on substantially similar terms with the Web
Series Noteholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Web Series Debt
Exchange Agreements, we and each Web Series Noteholder agreed to
convert an aggregate of $2.6 million of principal and $0.3 million
of accrued interest under the Web Series Loan and Security
Agreements into an aggregate of 587,804 shares of Common Stock at
$5.00 per share as payment in full of each of the notes issued
under the Web Series Loan and Security Agreements. For 576,676 of
the shares issued in exchange for the notes, the market price per
share of Common Stock at the time of conversion was $6.00 per
share. For the remaining 11,128 shares, the market price per share
at the time of conversion was $6.08. As a result, we recorded a
loss on the extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of
operations $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, related to this transaction. 

35 

Second Group Film Funding 

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into various loan and
security agreements with individual noteholders (the  Second
Loan and Security Noteholders ) for an aggregate principal
amount of notes of $9.3 million to fund a new group of film
projects (the  Second Loan and Security Agreements ).
Of this amount, notes with an aggregate principal value of $8.8
million were issued in exchange for debt that had originally been
incurred by Dolphin Entertainment, Inc., primarily related to the
production and distribution of the motion picture,
 Believe . The remaining $0.5 million was issued as a
note in exchange for cash. Pursuant to the Second Loan and Security
Agreements, we issued notes that accrue interest at rates ranging
from 11.25% to 12% per annum, payable monthly through December 31,
2016. We have the option to extend the maturity date of these notes
until July 31, 2018. If we choose to exercise our option to extend
the maturity date, we would be required to pay a higher interest
rate, increasing 1.25% to a range between 11.25% and 13.25%. The
Second Loan and Security Noteholders, as a group, will receive our
entire share of the proceeds from these projects, on a prorata
basis, until the principal investment is repaid. Thereafter, the
Second Loan and Security Noteholders, as a group, would have the
right to participate in 15% of our future profits from such
projects (defined as our gross revenues of such projects less the
aggregate amount of principal and interest paid for the financing
of such projects) on a prorate basis based on each Second Loan and
Security Noteholder s loan commitment as a percentage of the
total loan commitments received to fund specific motion picture
productions. 

On May
31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we entered into various debt exchange
agreements on substantially similar terms with certain of the
Second Loan and Security Noteholders to convert an aggregate of
$4.0 million of principal and $0.3 million of accrued interest into
shares of the Common Stock. Pursuant to such debt exchange
agreements, we agreed to convert the debt at $5.00 per share and
issued 868,870 shares of Common Stock. On May 31, 2016, the market
price of a share of the Common Stock was $6.99 and on June 30,
2016, it was $6.08. As a result, we recorded a loss on the
extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of operations
of $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

We
anticipate that additional debt under the Second Loan and Security
Agreements may be exchanged for shares of our Common Stock in the
near future. 

Production Service Agreement 

During
2014, we entered into a financing deal in the amount of $10.4
million to produce  Max Steel . The loan is partially
secured by international distribution agreements made prior to the
commencement of principal photography and tax incentives. The
agreement contains repayment milestones to be made during the year
ended December 31, 2015, that if not met, accrue interest at a
default rate of 8.5% per annum above the published base rate of
HSBC. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement and due to delays in
the release of the film, we have accrued $1.0 million of interest.
The film was released October 14, 2016 and delivery to the
international distributors has begun. We intend to complete
delivery and begin collection from the international distributors
during the fourth quarter of 2016 to repay the loan. 

Loan and Security Agreement   (Prints and Advertising
Loan) 

On
August 12, 2016, Dolphin Max Steel Holding, LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Dolphin Films, entered into a loan and security
agreement (the  P A Loan ) providing for a $14.5
million non-revolving credit facility that matures on August 25,
2017. The proceeds of the credit facility will be used to pay a
portion of the print and advertising expenses of the domestic
distribution of our feature film,   Max Steel  . To secure Max Steel
Holding s obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement,
we granted to the lender a security interest in bank account funds
totaling $1,250,000 pledged as collateral recorded as restricted
cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September
30, 2016. The loan is partially secureby a $4.5 million corporate
guaranty from a party associated with the motion picture. The
lender has retained a reserve of $1.5 million for loan fees and
interest (the  Reserve ). Amounts borrowed under the
credit facility will accrue interest at either (i) a fluctuating
per annum rate equal to the 5.5% plus a base rate or (ii) a per
annum rate equal to 6.5% plus the LIBOR determined for the
applicable interest period. As of September 30, 2016, we recorded
$10.6 million, including the Reserve, related to this agreement. We
recorded 9.2 million in direct costs related to the marketing of
the feature film. 

Subscription
Agreements 

Convertible Note Agreement 

On
December 7, 2015 we entered into a subscription agreement with an
investor to sell up to $7 million in convertible promissory notes
of the Company. Under the subscription agreement, we issued a
convertible promissory note to the investor in the amount of
$3,164,000 at a conversion price of $5.00 per share. The
convertible promissory note was to bear interest on the unpaid
balance at a rate of 10% per annum and became due and payable on
December 7, 2016. The outstanding principal amount and all accrued
interest were mandatorily and automatically convertible into common
stock, at the conversion price, upon the average market price of
the common stock being greater than or equal to the conversion
price for twenty trading days. On February 5, 2016, this triggering
event occurred pursuant to the convertible note agreement. As such
632,800 shares of common stock were issued in satisfaction of the
convertible note payable. 

36 

April 2016 Subscription Agreements 

On
April 1, 2016, we entered into substantially identical subscription
agreements (the  April 2016 Subscription Agreements )
with certain private investors, pursuant to which we issued and
sold to the investors in a private placement (the
 Placement ) an aggregate of 1,075,000 shares (the
 Initial Subscribed Shares ) of Common Stock at a
purchase price of $5.00 per share (the  Purchase
Price ). The Placement provided us with $5,375,000 of
aggregate gross proceeds. On March 31, 2016, we received
$1,500,000, in advance for one of these agreements. The amount was
recorded as noncurrent debt on our condensed consolidated balance
sheet. Under the terms of the April 2016 Subscription Agreements,
each investor has the option to purchase additional shares of
Common Stock at the Purchase Price, not to exceed the number of
such investor s Initial Subscribed Shares, during each of the
second, third and fourth quarters of 2016 (each, a  Quarterly
Subscription ). Pursuant to its April 2016 Subscription
Agreement, one investor delivered notice of its election to
exercise the Quarterly Subscription to purchase (i) 100,000 shares
for an aggregate purchase price of $.5 million with shares issued
on June 28, 2016 and (ii) 120,000 shares for an aggregate purchase
price of $.6 million with shares issued on November 17,
2016. 

June 2016 Subscription Agreements 

On June
22, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we entered into two additional
subscription agreements with two investors. Pursuant to the terms
of the subscription agreements, we sold an aggregate of 70,000
shares of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $5.00 per
share 

Going
Concern 

In the
audit opinion for our financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2015, our independent auditors included an
explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern based upon our net loss for
the year ended December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit as of
December 31, 2015 and our level of working capital. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of these uncertainties. Management is planning to raise
any necessary additional funds through loans, project-specific
financing and additional sales of our Common Stock; however, there
can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any
necessary additional loans or capital. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

See
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the
Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 for discussion of significant accounting
policies, recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if
any, on the Company. These policies have been followed for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Recent
accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or will be required
to adopt in the future are summarized below. 

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update on lease
accounting. This update requires lessees to put most leases on
their balance sheets. The new standard also requires new
disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the
amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The accounting standards update will be effective on a
retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods
within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will
have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to
addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. The accounting
standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified
retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with
early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our
consolidated financial statements. 

37 

In
October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update of
consolidation of entities held by related parties under common
control. The update amends the consolidation guidance on how
variable interest entities should treat indirect interest in the
entity held through related parties. The accounting standards
update will be effective on a retrospective or modified
retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with
early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our
consolidated financial statements. 

Other
recent Accounting Standards Updates not effective until after
September 30, 2016 are not expected to have a significant effect on
our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements.

Report on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

Disclosure controls
and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30,
2016. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses disclosed
in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015, filed with the Commission on March 31, 2016, which have not
been fully remediated as of the date of the filing of this
report. 

Remediation of
Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

In
order to remediate the other material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting, we are in the process of
finalizing a remediation plan, under the direction of our Board of
Directors, and intend to implement improvements during fiscal year
2016 as follows: 

Document all
significant accounting policies and ensure that the accounting
policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S. and that internal controls are designed
effectively to ensure that the financial information is properly
reported. Management will engage independent accounting
specialists, if necessary, to ensure that there is an independent
verification of the accounting positions taken. 

We will implement a
higher standard for document retention and support for all items
related to revenue recognition. All revenue arrangements that are
entered into by us will be evaluated under the applicable revenue
guidance and management should document their position based on the
facts and circumstances of each agreement. 

In connection with
the reported inadequately documented review and approval of certain
aspects of the accounting process, management has plans to assess
the current review and approval processes and implement changes to
ensure that all material agreements, accounting reconciliations and
journal entries are reviewed and approved on a timely basis and
that this review process is documented by a member of management
separate from the preparer. A documented quarter end close
procedure will be established whereby management will review and
approve reconciliations and journal entries. Management will
formally approve new vendors that are added to the master vendor
file. 

In connection with
the reported inadequate segregation of duties, management intends
to hire additional personnel in the Accounting and Finance area.
This will allow for adequate segregation of duties in performing
the accounting processes.    

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
our last fiscal quarter there were no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect such internal controls
over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

We have recently issued, and may in the future issue, a significant
amount of common stock and, as a result, your ownership interest in
the Company may be substantially diluted and your investment in our
common stock could suffer a material decline in value. 

During
the period December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, the number of
shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding has increased
from 4,094,618 (adjusted for a 20:1 reverse stock split on May 10,
2016) to 10,674,215 shares. Of this amount, approximately 4.7
million shares of Common Stock have been issued in private
placements as payment to certain debtholders of the Company
pursuant to debt exchange agreements. Consequently, we have not
received any cash proceeds in connection with such issuances of
Common Stock. In addition, 1.2 million recently issued shares of
Common Stock were issued in private placements pursuant to
subscription agreements. Generally, these subscription agreements
and debt exchange agreements provide for past or future purchases
of, or exchanges of debt for, our shares of Common Stock at a price
of $5.00 per share which, upon each exercise or exchange thus far,
has been below the market price of our Common Stock. As a result of
both types of issuances, your ownership interest in the Company has
been, and may in the future be, diluted. In addition, we have
historically experienced extremely low trading volumes. The market
price for our Common Stock has been volatile in the past, and these
recent issuances could cause the price of our Common Stock to
fluctuate substantially in the future. Once restricted stock issued
in the private placements becomes freely tradable, current or
future holders of Common Stock may decide to trade their shares
and, if our stock is thinly traded, this could have a material
adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.
Furthermore, we anticipate future issuances of Common Stock in
exchange for debt or pursuant to subscription agreements, which
could further exacerbate any or all of these potential
risks.

substantially identical debt exchange agreements with three
investors to issue 66,200 shares of the Company s common
stock at an exchange price of $5.00 per share to terminate three
Equity Finance Agreements for a cumulative original investment
amount of $331,000. The Company issued the shares in reliance upon
the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the

506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The investor
represented to the Company that such investor was an accredited

On
October 13, 2016, the Company entered into six substantially
identical subscription agreements, pursuant to which the Company
issued 25,000 shares at $5.00 per share and received $125,000. The
Company issued the shares in reliance upon the exemption from
registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Rule 506 of Regulation
D promulgated thereunder. The investor represented to the Company
that such investor was an accredited investor as defined by Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act .

reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section
4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities

ITEM 5. OTHER
INFORMATION   

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

On
November 15, 2016, Dolphin Entertainment converted 2,300,000 shares
of Series B   Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the  Series B
Preferred ) into 2,185,000 shares of Common Stock. The
Company previously issued the shares of Series B Preferred to
Dolphin Entertainment as consideration for the merger in which the
Company acquired Dolphin Films. Mr. O Dowd is the founder,
president and sole shareholder of Dolphin Entertainment which,
immediately prior to the merger, was the sole shareholder of
Dolphin Films. On November 16, 2016, T Squared Partners LP
( T Squared ) converted 1,000,000 shares of Series B
Preferred into 950,000 shares of Common Stock. In connection with
the merger, the Company had exchanged 1,042,753 shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, previously held by T
Squared for 1,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred. Each share of
Series B Preferred was convertible into 0.95 shares of Common
Stock. As a result of these two conversions, there are no remaining
shares of Series B Preferred issued and outstanding. 

The
issuance by the Company of Common Stock to each of Dolphin
Entertainment and T Squared upon conversion of the shares of Series
B Preferred was made in reliance upon the exemption from
registration requirements in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act.
