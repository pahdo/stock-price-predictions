  DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
   Description of the Business   
   
                       Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. ( Ecosphere,   ETI  or the  Company ) is a technology development and intellectual property licensing company that develops patented and proprietary solutions for the global water, agriculture, energy and industrial markets. The Company helps customers increase production, reduce costs and protect the environment through a portfolio of more than 35 patented and patent-pending technologies: technologies like Ozonix , the Ecos PowerCube  and the Ecos GrowCube , which are for sale and/or available for exclusive licensing opportunities across a wide range of industries and applications throughout the world.  
   
 In recent years, the Company s patented technologies have been used to deploy more than 60+ mobile water treatment systems around the United States and throughout the world, to treat and recycle more than 6+ billion gallons of water and generate more than $70 million in equipment sales, field service and technology licensing revenue. As a result, the Company has received numerous awards and accolades including but not limited to 2010/2011/2012 Top 50 Water Companies Award by the Artemis Project, the 2012 North American Product Leadership Award by Frost   Sullivan, 2013 Energy Innovation Pioneer Award by IHS Ceraweek, 2013 New Energy Pioneer by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 2013 American Technology Award by TechAmerica Foundation, 2013 World Technology Awards Finalist, 2013 Water Management Company of the Year by the Oil   Gas Awards, 2013 Rising Star at the Governor s Innovators in Business Awards by Enterprise Florida and the 2014 Best of What s New Award in the Green Category from  POPULAR SCIENCE.   
   
 The Company is currently focused on licensing, selling and manufacturing its patented technologies and products across a wide variety of global industries and applications including but not limited to Agriculture, Energy, Food   Beverage, Industrial, Marine, Mining and Municipal markets. These sales and licensing efforts are made through the Company and its subsidiaries, which include wholly-owned Ecosphere Development Company, LLC ( EDC ), majority-owned Sea of Green Systems, Inc ( SOGS ) and minority-owned Fidelity National Environmental Solutions, LLC ( FNES ). 
   
   Basis of Presentation   
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America ( U.S. ) as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or for any future period. The information included in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations contained in this report and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 Due to the nature of its technology licensing business model, Ecosphere presently, in contrast to before the oil and gas bust, does not have any regularly recurring revenue. The Company reported a net loss of $6,574,640 and $21,339,777 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash used in operating activities of $2,524,298 and $1,403,481 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit of $4,919,513 and $138,530,829, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. To support its operations, the Company has a number of plans to monetize its intellectual property, which is described below.  
   
 In order to stay operational, the Company s principal lender has continued to advance funds to the Company on an as needed basis.  During 2015 and through the date of this Report, the Company received $2,904,000 from its principal lender convertible at $0.115 per share and due in December 2017. The loan is secured by a variety of security interests on intellectual property including all fields of use of its Ozonix  patents excluding agriculture and on other assets of the Company (See Note 5). Until the Company can generate sufficient working capital to begin to repay this indebtedness and other indebtedness, this lender has rights, which are superior to the Company s shareholders as well as other creditors. Following September 30, 2016, the lender advanced another $500,000 with a conventional non-convertible note due in December 2017 (see Note 16).

ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

Due to the rapid decline in the oil and gas industry, in 2014 Ecosphere s management began to start diversifying its Ozonix  technology into other water treatment industries and applications, resulting in limited sales in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Malaysia.  
   
 As oil and gas drilling was reduced, Ecosphere s management, engineering and manufacturing teams have used their collective knowledge over the past 20 years to develop a comprehensive product portfolio for the fast growing, global Precision-Agriculture market that uses software, sensors and data driven analytics that can be accessed through the Internet by computers and smartphones to improve plant quality and increase crop yields.  
   
 In May 2016, Ecosphere entered into a long-term land lease to lease six acres of I-502 heavy industrial agricultural land in Washington State, zoned for legal I-502 marijuana cultivation and processing. In April 2016, Ecosphere formed a new subsidiary, EDC, of which the Company owns 100% and intends to develop the 6 acres of land and build state-of-the-art, turn-key growing facilities that it will rent to legal, licensed I-502 growers in Washington through EDC. These turnkey, high-tech growing facilities will incorporate Ecosphere s automated growing systems, as well as Ecosphere s patented water treatment technology purchased exclusively from SOGS, to maximize quality and yield for EDC s tenants, who will pay monthly rent and licensing fees to EDC in exchange for using its turnkey growing facilities. Phase 1 is presently being constructed on behalf of a subtenant that is a related party to the Company. This tenant has signed a 30-year lease to pay $250,000 per month for the term of the lease. 
   
 Ecosphere has spent the past two years locating and acquiring the I-502 zoned property as well as designing and engineering the equipment and facilities it plans to build and lease in Washington State. This new business segment will require infrastructure and equipment financing of up to $4 million ($1 million per phase) to develop the entire 6 acres, which EDC will build-out in phases for each licensed grower that agrees to its long-term leases. In June 2016, Ecosphere and EDC closed its first $1 million round of financing for Phase 1 of the Cannatech Agriculture Center in Washington State and has begun constructing its first turn-key growing facility.  EDC expects to complete construction in late January 2017 and assuming the first tenant receives its license from the Washington State Liquor Control Board, it could receive rental payments commencing as early as June 2017. The Company s is obligated to pay its principal lender a 7% royalty on Phase 1 revenues and a 10% royalty to the Company s CEO on all EDC revenues. Upon full completion of all four Phases, management expects that the 6-acre facility will generate approximately $1 million per month (which is for all four phases) through a combination of land, equipment, technology and consulting leases from its I-502 tenants for a period of 30 years, which is the term of the land lease. SOGS will receive 10% of revenues earned by EDC in connection with the rental income received from its tenants. Additionally, SOGS will sell to EDC all plant nutrients for EDC to in turn sell to its tenants. However, no assurance can be given on the outcome of this project and/or other future opportunities.  
   
 The Company and SOGS subsequent to September 30, 2016 have begun delivery of approximately $1.5M worth of precision, automated growing equipment to its customers operating in the Marijuana industry. As part of a 17-unit production run, which is made up of a 10-unit order for a licensed medical grower in North Las Vegas, Nevada and a 5-unit order for an equipment sales and leasing company operating throughout the United States, SOGS has now delivered six of its turn-key, state of the art DWC100 growing systems to its Las Vegas customer and expects to ship the remaining four DWC100 units in the coming weeks. In addition, SOGS has completed the manufacturing of one DWC100 unit, three DWC45 units and one VEG50 unit for its equipment-leasing customer and expects to also deliver these units in the quarter ending December 31, 2016. 
   
 Ecosphere and SOGS have engineered, manufactured and delivered a proprietary nutrient and fertilizer mixing system using Ecosphere s ultrasonic and hydrodynamic cavitation technologies to reduce nutrient and fertilizer particle sizes and increase plant growth efficiencies in the marijuana industry that will be marketed by SOGS under the Cavisonix  name. Ecosphere and SOGS have entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with its nutrient and fertilizer supplier to market and sell SOGS proprietary line of nutrients and fertilizers to the global agricultural markets. These potential customers include but are not limited to vegetable and fruit crops, turf-grass industries, vineyards, wineries, grapes, nightshades, potatoes, onions, corn, blueberries and all crops that use liquid based fertilizers. In exchange for these rights, SOGS is to receive a per gallon royalty fee on all nutrients and fertilizers sold to customers in the global agricultural markets. SOGS will be the exclusive reseller of its Cavisonix  nutrients to the global marijuana industry. 
   
 Ecosphere continues to actively market exclusive and non-exclusive licensing opportunities for sale to strategic, well positioned partners that wish to bring our patented Ozonix  and Ecos PowerCube  technologies to specific industries in their respective countries and regions of the world. Due to this expanded diversification strategy in addition to ongoing sales and licensing efforts of its patented technologies and products along with additional financing received, management believes it will have liquidity for the next 12 months and has identified the following liquidity sources that it expects to realize. The Company is presently in discussions with several potential customers to license its technologies, but no assurance can be made whether negotiations will be consummated.

ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

Ecosphere owns 100% of the global rights to its patented Ozonix  technology for all non-energy related applications, including but not limited to food and beverage, industrial, marine and municipal wastewater treatment, and any other industry in which water is treated with conventional liquid chemicals.  Ecosphere also owns 100% of the global right to its patented Ecos PowerCube  technology for all industries and applications worldwide.  
   
 Ecosphere s business model revolves upon the licensing of its intellectual property to strategic customers and partners around the world that are well positioned and capitalized to bring Ecosphere s patented technologies to their respective industries and countries. Additionally, Ecosphere has its own in-house design, engineering and manufacturing facilities to support customers and licensees that choose to not manufacture Ecosphere s patented technologies themselves. In addition to the various licensing opportunities that are available for its patented Ozonix  and Ecos PowerCube  technologies globally, the Company s 30.6% interest in FNES is also available for sale to strategic buyers. 
   
 Management believes that the realization of any of the above events will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. Historically, in the 18 years since inception, Ecosphere often has had liquidity problems but it has always found financing and new business to support its operations. Management believes that it will do so again although no assurances can be given. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 In addition to needing capital to support its operations, as of the date of this Report, Ecosphere has approximately $0.7 million of its convertible notes payable, notes payable and related party notes payable due within the next 12 months .

  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ecosphere and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries (Sea of Green Systems, Inc., Ecosphere Mining, LLC and Ecosphere Development Company, LLC). All other subsidiaries are inactive. The Company accounted for its 30.6% investment in FNES under the equity method (See Note 14) through September 30, 2015. All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
   
  Noncontrolling Interest  
   
 In October 2013, the Company s subsidiary, Ecosphere Mining, LLC, granted to its directors an aggregate of 5% ownership in Ecosphere Mining, LLC. Further in June 2015, the Company granted a note holder a 2.5% interest in Ecosphere Mining, LLC. Accordingly, the Company is presenting noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its consolidated balance sheets and reported noncontrolling interest net income or loss under the heading  Net (income) loss applicable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries  in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations based on its 92.5% ownership. 
   
 Through August 13, 2015, the Company owned 100% of SOGS. From August 14, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the Company reduced its ownership in SOGS through the sale and issuance of shares of SOGS common stock and at December 31, 2015, the Company s ownership in SOGS was approximately 69.49%. Accordingly, the Company is presenting noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its condensed consolidated balance sheets and reported noncontrolling interest net income or loss under the heading  Net (income) loss applicable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries  in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations based on its ownership. As of January 7, 2016 and through the date of this Report, ETI s ownership in SOGS has been reduced to 59.92%. 
   
 The Company s interest in SOGS may be further diluted by the following (excludes pledged shares held by ETI):

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of inventory, estimates of depreciable lives and valuation of property and equipment, estimates of amortization periods for intangible assets, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of derivative instruments, valuation of equity based instruments issued for other than cash, valuation of derivatives, valuation of remaining interest in FNES equity method investment and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
   
  Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at September 30, 2016. 
   
  Restricted Cash  
   
 Restricted cash as of September 30, 2016, represents $10,000 held pursuant to certain restrictions related to the Company's short-term financing arrangements. 
   
  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
   
 Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The Company reviews its accounts to estimate losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Any required allowance is based on specific analysis of past due accounts and also considers historical trends of write-offs. Past due status is based on how recently payments have been received from customers. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an allowance of $285,170 or 100% of the balance in connection with related party accounts receivable and at March 31, 2016, the Company recorded an additional allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,643 in connection with two of the Company s customers that have had uncollectable balances for 3 months or more. No additional allowances were recorded in 2016. 
   
  Inventory   
   
 Inventory is comprised of raw materials to manufacture Ozonix  and Ecos GrowCube  equipment, one prototype Ecos PowerCube  being held at the corporate offices in Stuart, FL and one self-contained, outdoor Ecos GrowCube  that is being used in Washington State for demonstration purposes. Both the Ecos PowerCube  and Ecos GrowCube  have been completed for future sale and demonstration purposes where no binding sales contract exists. In addition, the Company has work-in-process representing indoor Ecos GrowCube  units being manufactured for various equipment orders received in 2015 and 2016 from SOGS. Inventory on hand at each respective balance sheet date is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using a weighted average methodology. See Note 5 for security interest in inventory. 
   
  Property, Equipment and Capitalized Leases  
   
 Property and equipment is stated at cost. For equipment manufactured for use by the Company, cost includes direct component parts plus direct labor. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives generally ranging from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  
   
  Debt Issuance Cost  
   
 The Company accounts for debt issuance cost in accordance with ASC 470,  Debt . The costs associated with the issuance of debt are presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability and amortized over the life of the underlying debt instrument.  
   
  Patents  
   
 Patents are stated at cost and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited. All patents at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have either been acquired from a related company or assigned to the Company by the Company's founder. Patents are recorded at the historical cost basis. The Company recognized amortization expense of $8,625 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  (Unaudited)  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   
   
 The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less, costs to sell. 
   
  Investment in Unconsolidated Investee  
   
 The Company accounts for investments in which the Company owns more than 20% of the investee, using the equity method in accordance with ASC Topic 323,  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method, an investor initially records an investment in the stock of an investee at cost, and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor's share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition. The amount of the adjustment is included in the determination of net income by the investor, and such amount reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated statements including adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between investor cost and underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment. The investment of an investor is also adjusted to reflect the investor's share of changes in the investee's capital. Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred which is other than temporary and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value is in excess of what would otherwise be recognized by application of the equity method. 
   
  Derivative Instruments  
   
 ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging  ( ASC Topic 815 ), establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify and have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. The Company does not have any derivative instruments for which it has applied hedge accounting treatment. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  
   
 The Company measures its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as makes related disclosures, in accordance with ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC Topic 820 ). For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Amounts recorded for notes payable, net of discount, also approximate fair value because current interest rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities are substantially the same. 
   
 ASC Topic 820 provides guidance with respect to valuation techniques to be utilized in the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. Approaches include, (i) the market approach (comparable market prices), (ii) the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and (iii) the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). ASC Topic 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 
   
 Level 1:  
 Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2:

Revenue Recognition  
   
 For each of our revenue sources we have the following policies: 
   
  Equipment and Component Sales   
   
 Revenues and related costs on production type contracts are recognized using the  percentage of completion method  of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35,  Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts  ( ASC 605-35 ). Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All unallocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company will recognize the loss as it is determined. Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account. The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts,  an asset account, or  Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,  a liability account. 
   
 Production type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method, the Company accounts for these contracts using the  completed contract method  of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57. Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All unallocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company will recognize the loss as it is determined. The deferred asset (accumulated contract costs) in excess of the deferred liability (billings and/or cash received) is classified as a current asset under  Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts . The deferred liability (billings and/or cash received) in excess of the deferred asset (accumulated contract costs) is classified under current liabilities as  Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts . 
   
 A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.  
   
 The Company may manufacture products in anticipation of a future contract. Since there are no binding contracts relating to the purchase of these products, ASC 605-35 is not applicable. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, economic risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured, and any future obligations of the Company are insignificant. 
   
  Field Services  
   
 Revenue from water treatment contracts is earned based upon either, the volume of water processed plus additional period based contractual charges or a flat service fee and is recognized in the period the service is provided. Payments received in advance of the performance of services or of the delivery of goods are deferred as liabilities until the services are performed or the goods are delivered.  
   
 Some projects the Company undertakes are based upon our providing water processing services for fixed periods of time. Revenue from these projects is recognized based upon the number of days the service has been provided during the reporting period. 
   
  After Market Part Sales  
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of aftermarket parts during the period in which the parts are delivered to the buyer. 
   
  Royalties  
   
 Revenue from technology license royalties will be recorded if and as the royalties are earned. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded royalty revenue of $20,968 in connection with a licensing agreement.  
   
  Licensing Revenue   
   
 The Company typically amortizes licensing revenue over the life of a licensing agreement in accordance with SAB Topic 13f and the unamortized portion is recorded as deferred revenue. See Note 6.

Product Sales   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products during the period in which the parts are delivered to the buyer. 
   
 The Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in revenues and shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues. 
   
  Equity-based Compensation  
   
 Compensation expense for all stock-based employee and director compensation awards granted is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  ( ASC Topic 718 ). The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. Vesting terms vary based on the individual grant terms.  
   
 The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are freely transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The BSM option pricing model considers, among other factors, the expected term of the award and the expected volatility of the Company s stock price. Expected terms are calculated using the Simplified Method, volatility is determined based on the Company's historical stock price trends and the discount rate is based upon treasury rates with instruments of similar expected terms. Stock based compensation granted to non-employees is accounted for in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC Topic 505-50,  Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees.  
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. 
   
  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  
   
 The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 740-10-25, Income Taxes   Overall   Recognition ( ASC Topic 740-10-25 ) with respect to the accounting for uncertainty of income tax positions. ASC Topic 740-10-25 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As of September 30, 2016, tax years since 2012 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from the Internal Revenue Service for any of the open tax years. 
   
  Net Loss Per Share  
   
 The Company displays loss per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260 ). ASC 260 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted loss per share ( EPS ). Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares issuable and outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share include the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no potential common shares were included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because they were anti-dilutive.

The Company has defaulted on its required payments and the settlement amount increased to $150,000. The Company had originally accrued $197,500 in liabilities related to this settlement. As a result of the settlement, the Company reduced legal expense by $47,500 (as the original expense was charged to this account) leaving an accrued balance of $125,000 at December 31, 2012, which was comprised of the $150,000 obligation less the initial $25,000 payment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accrued balance of $70,833, which is comprised of the $150,000 obligation less $79,167 in payments. Since the Company has not been current in regards to payment, the Company will no longer record a $50,000 gain upon final payment in accordance with the settlement.

In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those set forth under  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  Company Overview  
   
 Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. ( Ecosphere,   ETI  or the  Company ) is a technology development and intellectual property licensing company that develops patented and proprietary solutions for the global water, agriculture, energy and industrial markets. The Company helps customers increase production, reduce costs and protect the environment through a portfolio of more than 35 patented and patent-pending technologies:  technologies like Ozonix , the Ecos PowerCube  and the Ecos GrowCube , which are for sale and/or available for exclusive licensing opportunities across a wide range of industries and applications throughout the world.  
   
 The Company is currently focused on licensing, selling and manufacturing its patented technologies and products across a wide variety of global industries and applications including but not limited to Agriculture, Energy, Food   Beverage, Industrial, Marine, Mining and Municipal markets. These sales and licensing efforts are made through the Company and its subsidiaries, which include wholly-owned Ecosphere Development Company, LLC ( EDC ), majority-owned Sea of Green Systems, Inc ( SOGS ) and minority-owned Fidelity National Environmental Solutions, LLC ( FNES ). 

Recent Developments and Success  
   
 In 2014, Ecosphere s management, engineering and manufacturing teams have used their collective knowledge over the past 20 years to develop a comprehensive product portfolio for the fast growing, global Precision-Agriculture market that uses software, sensors and data driven analytics that can be accessed through the Internet by computers and smartphones to improve plant quality and increase crop yields.  
   
 In May 2016, Ecosphere entered into a long-term land lease to lease six acres of I-502 heavy industrial agricultural land in Washington State, zoned for legal I-502 cultivation and processing. In April 2016, Ecosphere formed a new subsidiary, Ecosphere Development Company, LLC ( EDC ), of which the Company owns 100% and intends to develop the 6 acres of land and build state-of-the-art, turn-key growing facilities which it will rent to legal, licensed I-502 growers in Washington through EDC. These turnkey, high-tech growing facilities will incorporate Ecosphere s automated growing systems, as well as Ecosphere s patented water treatment technology purchased exclusively from SOGS, to maximize quality and yield for EDC s tenants, who will pay monthly rent and licensing fees to EDC in exchange for using its turnkey growing facilities. Phase 1 is presently being constructed on behalf of a subtenant. 
   
 Ecosphere has spent the past two years locating and acquiring the I-502 zoned property as well as designing and engineering the equipment and facilities it plans to build and lease in Washington State. This new business segment will require infrastructure and equipment financing of up to $4 million ($1 million per phase) to develop the entire 6 acres, which EDC will build-out in phases for each licensed grower that agrees to its long-term leases. In June 2016, Ecosphere and EDC closed its first $1 million round of financing for Phase 1 of the Cannatech Agriculture Center in Washington State and has begun constructing its first turn-key growing facility.  EDC expects to complete construction in late January 2017 and assuming the first tenant receives its license from the Washington State Liquor Control Board, it could receive rental payments commencing as early as June 2017. The Company s is obligated its principal lender 7% royalty and 10% royalty to the Company s CEO. Upon full completion of all four Phases, management expects that the 6-acre facility will generate approximately $1 million per month (which is for all four phases) through a combination of land, equipment, technology and consulting leases from its I-502 tenants for a period of 30 years, which is the term of the land lease. SOGS will receive 10% of revenues earned by EDC in connection with the rental income received from its tenants. Additionally, SOGS will sell to EDC all plant nutrients for EDC to in turn sell to its tenants. However, no assurance can be given on the outcome of this project and/or other future opportunities.  
   
 The Company and SOGS have begun delivery of approximately $1.5M worth of precision, automated growing equipment to its customers operating in the Marijuana industry. As part of a 17-unit production run, which is made up of a 10-unit order for a licensed medical grower in North Las Vegas, Nevada and a 5-unit order for an equipment sales and leasing company operating throughout the United States, SOGS has now delivered six of its turn-key, state of the art DWC100 growing systems to its Las Vegas customer and expects to ship the remaining four DWC100 units in the coming weeks. In addition, SOGS has completed the manufacturing of one DWC100 unit, three DWC45 units and one VEG50 unit for its equipment-leasing customer and expects to also deliver these units in the quarter ending December 31, 2016.

ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Liquidity   
   
 As of November 17, 2016, Ecosphere had cash on hand of approximately $25,000. Due to the nature of its technology licensing business model, Ecosphere presently does not have any regularly recurring revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. To support its operations, the Company has a number of plans to monetize its intellectual property, which is described below.  
   
 In order to stay operational, the Company s principal lender has continued to advance funds to the Company on an as needed basis.  During 2015 and through the date of this Report, the Company received $2,904,000 from its principal lender which loan is convertible at $0.115 per share and due in December 2017. The loan is secured by a variety of security interests on intellectual property including all fields of use of its Ozonix  patents excluding agriculture and on other assets of the Company. Until the Company can generate sufficient working capital to begin to repay this indebtedness and other indebtedness, this lender has rights, which are superior to the Company s shareholders as well as other creditors.  
   
 Due to the rapid decline in the oil and gas industry, in 2014 Ecosphere s management began to start diversifying its Ozonix  technology into other water treatment industries and applications, resulting in increased customer adoption in the United States, Canada, Brazil and most recently Malaysia.  
   
 As its primary focus over the past two years, Ecosphere s management, engineering and manufacturing teams have used their collective knowledge over the past 20 years to develop a comprehensive product portfolio for the fast growing, global Precision-Agriculture market that uses software, sensors and data driven analytics that can be accessed through the Internet by computers and smartphones to improve plant quality and increase crop yields.  
   
 EDC expects substantial lease revenues which may begin as early as June 2017. To meet its working capital needs until then, Ecosphere is seeking to raise up to $1 million for EDC.  
   
 Ecosphere and SOGS have engineered, manufactured and delivered a proprietary nutrient and fertilizer mixing system using Ecosphere s ultrasonic and hydrodynamic cavitation technologies to reduce nutrient and fertilizer particle sizes and increase plant growth efficiencies that will be marketed by SOGS under the Cavisonix  name. Ecosphere and SOGS have entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with its nutrient and fertilizer supplier to sell SOGS proprietary line of nutrients and fertilizers to the marijuana industry as well as the global agricultural markets. In exchange for these rights, SOGS is to receive a per gallon royalty fee on all nutrients and fertilizers sold to customers in the global agricultural markets, except marijuana. These potential customers include but are not limited to vegetable and fruit crops, turf-grass industries, vineyards, wineries, grapes, nightshades, potatoes, onions, corn, blueberries and all crops that use liquid based fertilizers.  
   
 Ecosphere continues to actively market exclusive and non-exclusive licensing opportunities for sale to strategic, well positioned partners that wish to bring our patented Ozonix  and Ecos PowerCube  technologies to specific industries in their respective countries and regions of the world. Due to this expanded diversification strategy in addition to ongoing sales and licensing efforts of its patented technologies and products along with additional financing received, management believes it will have liquidity for the next 12 months and has identified the following liquidity sources that it expects to realize. With our management focused on EDC s business and SOGS without any sales and marketing staff or resources, our penetration of these multiple fields and territories will be necessarily constrained.  
   
 Ecosphere owns 100% of the global rights to its patented Ozonix  technology for all non-energy related applications, including but not limited to food and beverage, industrial, marine and municipal wastewater treatment, and any other industry in which water is treated with conventional liquid chemicals.  Ecosphere also owns 100% of the global right to its patented Ecos PowerCube  technology for all industries and applications worldwide.  
   
 Ecosphere s business model revolves upon the licensing of its intellectual property to strategic customers and partners around the world that are well positioned and capitalized to bring Ecosphere s patented technologies to their respective industries and countries. Additionally, Ecosphere has its own in-house design, engineering and manufacturing facilities to support customers and licensees that choose to not manufacture Ecosphere s patented technologies themselves. In addition to the various licensing opportunities that are available for its patented Ozonix  and Ecos PowerCube  technologies globally, the Company s 30.6% interest in FNES is also available for sale to strategic buyers.

ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management believes that the realization of any of the above events will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. Historically, in the 18 years since inception, Ecosphere often has had liquidity problems but it has always found financing and new business to support its operations. Management believes that it will do so again although no assurances can be given. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 In addition to needing capital to support its operations, as of the date of this Report, Ecosphere has approximately $0.7 million of its convertible notes payable, notes payable and related party notes payable due within the next 12 months .  
   
      CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   
   
 This report contains forward-looking statements, including statements that relate to our liquidity, completion of Phase 1 by EDC and expanding our technology into other industries. Forward looking statements can be identified by words such as  anticipates,   intends,   plans,   seeks,   believes,   estimates,   expects  and similar references to future periods.  
   
 Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the condition of the credit and financial markets, our ability to raise short-term and long-term working capital, future legislation and regulations which affect the marijuana industry, Washington State Liquor Control Board review of tenant applications, the qualifications of future tenants with such regulations and the ability to find purchasers and investors for our technologies. Forward-looking statements contained in this report also include statements related to the Company s efforts to increase liquidity and its prospective business relationships, including, but not limited to, the following: the ultimate success of our recent pilot demonstration with a U.S. power company and our ability to turn that pilot into a business relationship going forward; and our ability to finance, develop, and successfully operate EDC s operations in the State of Washington. In addition, our expectation that certain lenders will not exercise their default rights constitutes a forward-looking statement. 
   
 Further information on our risk factors is contained in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  
   
 Research and development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $210,944 and $236,552 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles do not permit the Company to categorize a significant portion of the Company s selling, general and administrative expenses which totaled $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 all of which were largely a part of the research and development of its precision agriculture technology, the Company s management considers such expenses as being research since they were incurred developing new technology.
