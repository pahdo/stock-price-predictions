TWO HANDS CORPORATION  
  (formerly Innovative Product Opportunities Inc.)  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 Two Hands Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated on April 3, 2009 in the State of Delaware and established a fiscal year end of December 31. 
   
 Our business is a research and product development firm.  Over the past few years we have specialized in computer vision and gesture recognition technologies.  We have leveraged our relationship with our product development team of programmers and designers to implement our vision for building a state of the art co-parenting application due to launch in the first quarter of 2017.   The operations of the business are carried on by a 100% owned subsidiary, I8 Interactive Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada. 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements of Two Hands Corporation (formerly Innovative Product Opportunities Inc) have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements for interim financial statements. Therefore, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Two Hands Corporation (formerly Innovative Product Opportunities Inc.) in our Form 10-K filed on March 29, 2016. 
   
 The interim financial statements present the balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flows of Two Hands Corporation (formerly Innovative Product Opportunities Inc.).  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
   
 The interim financial information is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the full year. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  Currently, the Company does not have significant operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of $23,429,869. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of its common stock in order to implement its business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this situation.  Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. The Company is funding its initial operations by way of loans from its Chief Executive Office and others, and the use of equity to pay some operating expenses.  The Company's officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company. 
   
 USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
   
 Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

6 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
   
 For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
 REVENUE RECOGNITION 
   
 The Company recognizes revenues and the related costs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and acceptance has occurred or service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  Amounts invoiced or collected in advance of product delivery or providing services are recorded as deferred revenue or customer deposits.  The company accrues for sales returns, bad debts, and other allowances based on its historical experience. Net sales under certain long-term contracts for product design, which may provide for periodic payments, are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimated cost-at-completion for these contracts are reviewed on a routine periodic basis, and adjustments are made periodically to the estimated cost-at-completion, based on actual costs incurred, progress made, and estimates of the costs required to complete the contractual requirements. When the estimated cost-at-completion exceeds the contract value, the contract is written down to its net realizable value, and the loss resulting from cost overruns is immediately recognized. 
   
 To properly match net sales with costs, certain contracts may have revenue recognized in excess of billings (unbilled revenues), and other contracts may have billings in excess of net sales recognized (customer deposits). Under long-term contracts, the prerequisites for billing the customer for periodic payments generally involve the Company's achievement of contractually specific, objective milestones. 
   
 Revenue for services contracts will be recognized under a proportional performance model if the following criteria are met (i) the arrangement provides for periodic billings as services are provided (ii) the customer receives value as the services as rendered, not just upon the completion of the services and (iii) the customer need not re-perform services that it has already received if it terminates the service contract early and hires another service provider to complete the service deliverable. If these criteria are not met, the Company will recognize revenue on the service contracts using the completed contract method. 
   
 INCOME TAXES 
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC ) 740, Income Taxes. Under the assets and liability method of FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. 
   
 NET LOSS PER SHARE 
   
 Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the periods presented. 
   
 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
   
 The financial statements are presented in the Company s functional currency which is the United States dollars.  In accordance with FASB ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the periods presented.  Related translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit), whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations. 

7 

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
   
 The Company measures stock-based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. 
   
 The Company also grants awards to non-employees and determines the fair value of such stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty's performance is completed. 
   
 The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. 
   
 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
   
 The Company has adopted ASC Topic 220 - Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and the display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners or distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, Topic 220 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under the current accounting standards as a component of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income is displayed in the statement of stockholders' deficit and in the balance sheet as a component of stockholders' deficit. 
   
 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
   
 In accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, the Company has determined the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The statement establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred sources of values, followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs.  The statement requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 
     
 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
   Level 2   Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
 Level 3   Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. 
   Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
   
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.  The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early adoption is permitted in annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

8 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases .  ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
 Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
   
 This report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements  that involve risks and uncertainties.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in our Form 10-K filed on March 29, 2016, and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. 
   
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report, and in our Form 10-K filed on March 29, 2016. 
   
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
   
 We incorporated on April 3, 2009 as Two Hands Corporation (formerly Innovative Product Opportunities Inc.) under the laws of the State of Delaware. We expect to incur losses in the foreseeable future due to significant costs associated with our business start-up, developing our business and costs associated with on-going operations. Our business is a research and product development firm specializing in computer vision and gesture recognition technologies targeted at the staging and lighting industry. The operations of the business are carried on by a 100% owned subsidiary, I8 Interactive Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of Canada. 
   
 MANAGEMENT'S STRATEGIC VISION 
   
 We strive to create a complete co-parenting solution. It is our ultimate goal to improve the lives of families especially the lives of children that are affected by a divorce. 
   
  Two Hands  is the product of years of searching for the ideal solution that will reduce the stress and worries of co-parenting. Our application fulfills our mission and vision that focuses on organization and communication to improve family relationships despite a divorce. 
   
 We would like to be recognized as the company that improves family relationships and improved organization and communication between family members. 
   
 Our mission is to equip parents with the best tools to be able to communicate with each other in a divorced or separated household.   Two Hands App  began as an idea to help ease the worries of parents when it comes to co-parenting after a divorce or a separation. 
   
 A personal experience has led the creator of the app to come up with a better solution that uses the internet foremost to provide better communication and organization between divorced parties. 
   
 After years of collaborating with fellow parents and co-parents, and through the help of our designers and programmers,  Two Hands App  was conceived. It has all the important features that any parent, co-parent or caregiver would ever need to deal with any kind of activity concerning children.  Two Hands App  focuses on reducing the stress of parents and their children. 
   
  Two Hands App  is accessed primarily through the internet which makes it easier to connect to people and manage one or two households at the same time. We have made it possible for the application to be accessed from all kinds of devices and have made it easier to understand even for someone who is not tech savvy. 
   
  Two Hands App  is under development. Our team of designers and developers understand that along with constant changes in technology, the lives of families and children are also changing as well. There is no doubt that we keep abreast with life s constant changes to provide the best service for co-parents everywhere. 
   
 We plan to launch our application in the first quarter of 2017. 

13 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
 COMPARISON OF RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SETPEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015. 
   
 REVENUES 
   
 Our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $29,692 and $118,530 of revenue for installation of a touch and gesture interactive bar-top experience, respectively, compared to $23,064 and $35,900 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. We are completely dependent upon the willingness of our management to fund our initial operations by way of loans from our Chief Executive Officer and shareholders. 
   
 COSTS OF GOODS SOLD 
   
 Our costs of goods for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $18,604 and $37,095, respectively, compared to $0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 OPERATING EXPENSES 
   
 Our general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $137,780 and $374,344, respectively, compared to $103,908 and $135,634 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The expenses can be primarily attributed to our need to pay for professional fees, our transfer agent, officer compensation and investment relations. Our bad debt expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,992, compared to $0 and $8,250 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 120,000,000 and 120,075,000 shares of common stock of the Company valued at $156,000 and $256,000 for consulting services, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we issued 25,000 and 260,670 shares of common stock of the Company valued at $5,000 and $242,072 for consulting services, respectively. 
   
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 
   
 Accretion of debt discount for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $56,969 and $93,270, respectively, compared to $17,293 and $51,313 for the three and nine months ended September e 30, 2015, respectively. Gain on extinguishment of the debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,886, compared to $0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 NET INCOME/LOSS 
   
 Our net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $318,142 and $623,160, respectively, compared to $104,387 and $417,619 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Our losses are due to costs associated with professional fees, our transfer agent, investor relations, bad debt and stock-based compensation for services. 
   
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 LIQUIDITY 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $665 and total current liabilities of $407,468, resulting in a working capital deficit of $406,803.  At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $665.  Our cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $24,900. Our current cash balance and cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund our operations. Our cash flow from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,542. Our cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0. The Company has an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of $23,429,869. The deficit reported at September 30, 2016 is largely a result of operating expenses for officer compensation, professional fees, our transfer agent, investor relations, stock-based compensation and loss on issuance of stock-based compensation for services. 
   
 Over the next 12 months we expect to expend approximately $50,000 in cash for legal, accounting and related services and an additional $150,000 in cash to implement our business plan. We hope to be able to compensate our independent contractors with stock-based compensation, which will not require us to use our cash, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts. 

14 

We expect to be able to secure capital through advances from our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others in order to pay expenses such as organizational costs, filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees. We believe it will be difficult to secure capital in the future because we have no assets to secure debt and there is currently no trading market for our securities.  We will need additional capital in the next twelve months and if we cannot raise such capital on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our operations or terminate our business entirely. 
   
 The inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures for developing products and services, or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations.  Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders. 
   
 OPERATING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS 
   
 We are currently funding our operations by way of cash advances from our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others.  We hope to be able to compensate our independent contractors with stock-based compensation, which will not require us to use our cash, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts.  We expect that we will be required to raise an additional $200,000 in cash by issuing new debt or equity for operating costs in order to implement our business plan in the next twelve months. The funds are loaned to the Company as required to pay amounts owed by the Company.  As such, our operating capital is currently limited to the personal resources of our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others.  The loans from our Chief Executive Officer, note holders, shareholders and others are unsecured and non-interest bearing and have no set terms of repayment. Our common stock started trading over the counter and has been quoted on the Over-The Counter Bulletin Board since February 17, 2011. The stock currently trades under the symbol  IPRU.OB.  
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS 
   
 We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 As a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 
   
  ITEM 4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
   
 As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our company's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated. 

15 

We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 
   
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 
   
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  
   
 We may be involved from time to time in ordinary litigation, negotiation and settlement matters that will not have a material effect on our operations or finances. We are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against our Company or our officers and directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact on our operations or finances. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  
   
 A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
   
  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.  
   
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we did not have any unregistered sales of equity securities. 
   
  ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.  
   
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we did not have any defaults upon senior securities. 
   
  ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES  
   
 Not applicable. 
   
  ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.  
   
 Not applicable.
