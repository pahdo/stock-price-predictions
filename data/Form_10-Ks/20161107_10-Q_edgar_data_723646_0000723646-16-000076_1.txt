FRANKLIN FINANCIAL SERVICES CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 - Basis     of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Franklin Financial Services Corporation (the Corporation), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Farmers and Merchants Trust Company of Chambersburg (the Bank) and Franklin Future Fund Inc.  Farmers and Merchants Trust Company of Chambersburg is a commercial bank that has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Franklin Financial Properties Corp.      Franklin Financial Propert  ies   Corp. holds real estate assets that are leased by the Bank. Franklin Future Fund Inc. is a non-bank investment company. The activities of non-bank entities are not significant to the consolidated totals.  All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of   September    3  0  , 201  6  , and for all other periods presented have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation s 201  5   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The consolidated results of operations for the   three and   nine   month   period  s   ended   September     3  0  , 201  6   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  Management has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. 

The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 201  5   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. 

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold.  Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods.   

Earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period end.  A reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share follows: 

Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Statements of Cash Flow (  Topic   320  ).    In   August   2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic   320  ).   ASU 2016-15 clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are intended to reduce diversity in practice.  The ASU contains additional guidance clarifying when an entity should separate cash receipts and cash payments and classify them into more than one class of cash flows (including when reasonable judgement is required to estimate and allocate cash flows) versus when an entity should classify the aggregate amount into one class of cash flows on the basis of predominance.  The amendments are effective fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after  

6   

December 15, 2017.    The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the amended standard on its consolidated financial statements.   

Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326).   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   ASU 2016-13 requires credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model).  Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument (considering estimated prepayments, but not expected extensions or modifications unless reasonable expectation of a troubled debt restructuring exists) from the date of initial recognition of that instrument.  The ASU replaces the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities.  The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ), should be determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis.  However, upon initial recognition, the allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price ( gross up approach ) to determine the initial amortized cost basis.  The subsequent account for PCD financial assets is the same expected loss model described above.    The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   The amendments in this Update (ASU 2014-09) establish a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for virtually all industries under U.S. GAAP, including those that previously followed industry-specific guidance such as the real estate, construction and software industries. The revenue standard s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps:   (  i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The ASU is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Three basic transition methods are available   full retrospective, retrospective with certain practical expedients, and a cumulative effect approach. Under the third alternative, an entity would apply the new revenue standard only to contracts that are incomplete under legacy U.S. GAAP at the date of initial application (e.g. January 1, 2017) and recognize the cumulative effect of the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. That is, prior years would not be restated and additional disclosures would be required to enable users of the financial statements to understand the impact of adopting the new standard in the current year compared to prior years that are presented under legacy U.S. GAAP. Early adoption is prohibited under U.S. GAAP. The Corporation does not believe ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on its financial statements.    

Financial Instruments   Overall   (Topic 825-10). In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Topic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  ASU 2016-01 amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  Some of the amendments in ASU 2016-01 include the following: 1) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; and 4) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value; among others.  For public business entities, the amendments of ASU 2016-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Corporation does not believe ASU 2016-01 will have a material effect on its financial statements. 

Leases (Topic 842)  . In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02, Leases.  F  r  om the lessee s perspective, the new standard established a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income  

7   

statement for a lessees.  From the lessor s perspective, the new standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating.  A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee.  If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as financing.  If the lessor doesn t convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. 

The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.      

Note 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 

The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss  es   included in shareholders' equity are as follows:

Note   4  . Investments 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as of   September    3  0  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5     are   as follows  : 

At   September     3  0  , 201  6     and December 31, 201  5  , the fair value of investment securities pledged to secure public funds, trust balances, deposit and other obligations   totaled $  86  .  0   million   and $  79  .6   million  , respectively. 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at   September    3  0  , 201  6  , by contractual maturity are shown below.     Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayment or call options embedded in the securities.

Impairment  : 

The investment portfolio contained fifty securities with $29.0 million of temporarily impaired fair value and $756 thousand in unrealized losses at September 30, 2016. The total unrealized loss position has improved from a $1.3 million unrealized loss at year-end 2015.   

For securities with an unrealized loss, Management applies a systematic methodology in order to perform an assessment of the potential for other-than-temporary impairment.  In the case of debt securities, investments considered for other-than-temporary impairment: (1) had a specified maturity or repricing date; (2) were generally expected to be redeemed at par, and (3) were expected to achieve a recovery in market value within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the Bank considers whether it intends to sell these securities or whether it will be forced to sell these securities before the earlier of amortized cost recovery or maturity. Equity securities are assessed for other-than-temporary  

10   

impairment based on the length of time of impairment, dollar amount of the impairment and general market and financial conditions relating to specific issues.  The impairment identified on debt and equity securities and subject to assessment at September 30, 2016, was deemed to be temporary and required no further adjustments to the financial statements, unless otherwise noted.  

The following table reflects temporary impairment in the investment portfolio (excluding restricted stock), aggregated by investment category, length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and the number of securities in each category as of   September     30  , 201  6    and December 31, 201  5  : 

The unrealized loss in the municipal bond portfolio decreased to   $92   thousand from   $218   thousand at December 31, 2015 as market prices improved during the quarter.  There are three securities in this portfolio with an unrealized loss and the loss in this portfolio is deemed to be non-credit related and no other-than-temporary impairment charges have been recorded.  

The trust preferred portfolio contains seven securities with a fair value of $5.4 million and an unrealized loss of $555 thousand The trust-preferred securities held by the Bank are single entity issues, not pooled trust preferred securities.  Therefore, the impairment review of these securities is based only on the issuer and the security cannot be impaired by the performance of other issuers as if it was a pooled trust-preferred bond. All of the Bank s trust preferred securities are single issue, variable rate notes with long maturities (2027   2028).  None of these bonds have suspended or missed a dividend payment. At September 30, 2016, the Bank believes it will be able to collect all interest and principal due on these bonds     and no other-than-temporary-impairment charges were recorded.   

There is one PLMBS bond showing a small unrealized loss of $7 thousand.  However, the PLMBS sector as a whole is showing a     n  et   unrealized gain of $50 thousand at quarter end.  This is primarily a result of the cumulative OTTI charges recorded on this portfolio.  Due to the nature of these bonds, they are evaluated closely. These bonds were all rated AAA at time of purchase, but have since experienced rating declines. Some have experienced increased delinquencies and defaults, while others have seen the credit support increase as the bonds paid-down. The Bank monitors the performance of the PLMBS investments on a regular basis and reviews delinquencies, default rates, credit support levels and various cash flow stress test scenarios. In determining the credit related loss, Management considers all principal past due   60   days or more as a loss. If additional principal moves beyond 60 days past due, it will also be considered a loss.  The Bank recorded a   $30   thousand impairment charge during the first nine months of 2016 and has recorded   $585   thousand of  

11   

cumulative impairment charges on this portfolio. Management continues to monitor these securities and it is possible that additional write-downs may occur if current loss trends continue.

The Bank held $1.1 million of restricted stock at September 30, 2016.  Except for   $30   thousand, this investment represents stock in FHLB Pittsburgh. The Bank is required to hold this stock to be a member of FHLB and it is carried at cost of   $100   per share. The level of FHLB stock held is determined by FHLB and is comprised of a minimum membership amount plus a variable activity amount. FHLB stock is evaluated for impairment primarily based on an assessment of the ultimate recoverability of its cost. As a government sponsored entity, FHLB has the ability to raise funding through the U.S. Treasury that can be used to support its operations.  There is not a public market for FHLB stock and the benefits of FHLB membership (e.g., liquidity and low cost funding) add value to the stock beyond purely financial measures. Management intends to remain a member of the FHLB and believes that it will be able to fully recover the cost basis of this investment.           

Note   5  . Loans 

The Bank reports i  t  s loan portfolio based on the primary collateral of the loan. It further classifies these loans by the primary purpose, either consumer or commercial.

The Bank expects its pension expense to increase to approximately $  922   thousand in 2016 compared to $  387   thousand in 2015  . This increase is   due to a pension settlement expense of approximately   $  564   thousand   that will be recorded during the second half of 2016  , as a result of lump sum distributions  .    No   pension contributions were made or are expected to be made in 2016. 

Note   9  .  Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Corporation s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique.  Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Corporation could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated.  The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective   period  -ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates.  As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates maybe different than the amounts reported at each year-end. 

FASB ASC Topic 820,  Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including those financial assets and liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. The Corporation does not report any nonfinancial assets at fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC Topic 820 are as follows: 

Level 1  : Valuation is based on unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2  :    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.  There may be substantial differences in the assumptions used for securities within the same level.  For example, prices for U.S. Agency securities have fewer assumptions and are closer to level 1 valuations than the private label mortgage backed securities that require more assumptions and are closer to level 3 valuations. 

Level 3  : Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation s assumptions regarding what market participants would assume when pricing a financial instrument.   

An asset s or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Corporation s financial instruments at   September   30, 2016     and   December 31, 201  5  . 

Cash and Cash Equivalents:    For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Investment securities  :  The fair value of investment securities is determined in accordance with the methods described under FASB ASC Topic 820 as discussed below. 

21   

Restricted stock:    The carrying value of restricted stock approximates its fair value based on redemption provisions for the restricted stock. 

Loans held for sale  : The fair value of loans held for sale is determined by the price set between the Bank and the purchaser prior to origination. These loans are usually sold at par.  

Net loans   (including impaired loans)  :    The fair value of fixed-rate loans is estimated for each major type of loan (e.g. real estate, commercial, industrial and agricultural and consumer) by discounting the future cash flows associated with such loans using rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of comparable credit quality.  The model considers scheduled principal maturities, repricing characteristics, prepayment assumptions and interest cash flows.  The discount rates used are estimated based upon consideration of a number of factors including the treasury yield curve, expense and service charge factors. For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit quality, carrying values approximate the fair value. 

Accrued Interest Receivable:    T  he carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Deposits   and     Short-term borrowings  :    The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.  The fair value of fixed-rate certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates approximating those currently offered for certificates of deposit with similar remaining maturities.    For short-term borrowings  , the carrying value approximates a reasonable estimate of the fair value. 

Accrued interest payable:    The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

The following information regarding the fair value of the Corporation s financial instruments should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Corporation since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Corporation s assets and liabilities.  Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Corporation s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.   

22   

The fair value of the Corporation's financial instruments are as follows: 

23   

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

For financial assets   and liabilities   measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used at   September   30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5   are as follows: 

The Corporation used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair values for financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Investment securities  :  Level 1 securities represent equity securities that are valued using quoted market prices from nationally recognized markets. Level 2 securities represent debt securities that are valued using a mathematical model based upon the specific characteristics of a security in relationship to quoted prices for similar securities.      

24   

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

For financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used at   September 3  0, 2016   and December 31, 201  5     are as follows: 

(1) 

Includes assets directly charged-down to fair value during the year-to-date period.     

The Corporation used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair values for financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

Impaired loans  : Impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.  Collateral values are estimated using Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria.  

Premises held-for-sale  : The fair value of premises held for sale, upon initial recognition, is estimated using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.    

Other real estate  : The fair value of other real estate, upon initial recognition, is estimated using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy based on observable market data and Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria.  In connection with the measurement and initial recognition of the foregoing assets, the Corporation recognizes charge-offs through the allowance for loan losses.    Subsequent charge-offs are recognized as an expense. 

The Corporation did   not   record any liabilities at fair value for which measurement of the fair value was made on a nonrecurring basis at   September   30, 2016  . For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, there were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level   1   and Level   2   during the period ending   September   30, 2016  . 

The following table presents additional quantitative information about Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

Note 1  0  .  Financial Derivatives 

The Board of Directors has given Management authorization to enter into derivative activity including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, forward-rate agreements, options and futures contracts in order to hedge interest rate risk.  The Bank is exposed to credit risk equal to the positive fair value of a derivative instrument, if any, as a positive fair value indicates that the counterparty to the agreement is financially liable to the Bank.  To limit this risk, counterparties must have an investment grade long-term debt rating and individual counterparty credit exposure is limited by Board approved parameters.    The final swap transaction matured in 2015.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements ( Swap Agreements ) 

As of   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank had   no   swap agreements outstanding.   The Bank ha  d   entered into interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset/liability management program.  The swap agreements   we  re free-standing derivatives and   we  re recorded at fair value in the Corporation s consolidated statements of condition.  The Bank   wa  s party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, the Bank d  id   not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes.  The master netting arrangements provide  d   for a single net settlement of all swap agreements, as well as collateral, in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract.  Collateral, in the form of marketable securities,   wa  s posted by the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds.   

Note 1  1  . Capital Ratios 

Capital adequacy is currently defined by regulatory agencies through the use of several minimum required ratios.    In July 2013, Federal banking regulators approved the final rules from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for the regulation of capital requirements for bank holding companies and U.S banks, generally referred to as  Basel III.  The Basel III standards were effective for the Corporation and the Bank, effective January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions).  Basel III imposes significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios than those previously in place.  The capital ratios to be considered  well capitalized  under Basel III are: (1) Common Equity Tier 1(CET1) of 6.5%, (2) Tier 1 Leverage of 5%, (3)Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital of 8%, and (4) Total Risk-Based Capital of 10%.  The CET1 ratio is a new capital ratio under Basel III and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% has been increased from   6%  . The rules also include changes in the risk weights of certain assets to better reflect credit and other risk exposures. In addition, a capital conservation buffer will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2016 at   0.  6  25%  , increasing each year until fully implemented in 2019 at   2.5%   above the minimum capital ratios required to avoid any capital distribution restrictions. The capital conservation buffer will be applicable to all of the capital ratios except for the Tier1 Leverage ratio. When fully implemented, the capital conservation buffer will have the effect of increasing the minimum capital ratios by 2.5%.  As of   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank was  well capitalized  under the  

26   

Basel III requirements and believes it would be  well capitalized  on a fully-phased in basis had such a requirement been in effect.  

The following table   summarizes regulatory capital information as of   September    3  0  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5     (restated) for the Corporation and the Bank  .    The adequately capitalized minimum ratios, except for the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, include the   0  .625%   Capital Conservation buffer effective for 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management has identified critical accounting policies for the Corporation  .  These policies are particularly sensitive, requiring significant judgements, estimates and assumptions to be made by Management. T  here were no changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the 201  5   Annual Report on Form 10-K in regards to application or related judgments and estimates used.  Please refer to Item 7 of the Corporation s 201  5   Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed disclosure of the critical accounting policies. 

Results of Operations 

Year-to-Date Summary 

At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , total assets were $1.  107   billion, an increase of $  71  .  8   million from December 31, 201  5  . Net loans   in  creased to $  8  47  .  9   million and total deposits increased to $  9  78  .  6   million.  The Corporation reported net income for the first   nine   months of 201  6   of $  6  .  4   million.  This is a   19  .  8  %    de  crease versus net income of $  7  .  9   million for the same period in 201  5  .    Net income for 201  6   was     negatively affected by a provision for loan loss expense that was $  2  .  3   million more than 2015, while 2015 was enhanced by two nonrecurring events that increased noninterest income by $899 thousand.      Despite the nonrecurring events in 2015, t  otal revenue (interest income and noninterest income)   for the first   nine months   of 2016 inc  reased   by    $  471   thousand   year-over-year. Interest income   in  creased $  1.6 million  ,    while interest expense   decrease  d     by    $  1  58   thousand  , resulting in a $  1.  8     million     in  crease in net interest income. The provision for loan losses was $  3  .  3     million for the first   nine   months of 2016  , $  2  .  3     million     more   than in 201  5  , as a result of loan growth and one large loan charge-off  .    Noninterest income   de  creased $  1.1 million   due to the nonrecurring events in 2015  , while     n  oninterest expense   in  creased   $  493   thousand.   Income tax expense   de  creas  ed from $  1.  8   million   in   201  5   to $  1.2 million   in 201  6  . The effective tax rate   de  creased from   18  .  3  % in 201  5   to   1  5  .  8  % in 201  6  .     Diluted earnings per share   de  creased to $  1.  48   in 201  6   from $  1.  87   in 201  5  .

GAAP versus non-GAAP Presentations       The Corporation supplements its traditional GAAP measurements with certain non-GAAP measurements to evaluate its performance and to eliminate the effect of intangible assets.  By eliminating intangible assets, the Corporation believes it presents a measurement that is comparable to companies that have no intangible assets or to companies that have eliminated intangible assets in similar calculations. However, not all companies may use the same calculation method for each measurement. The non-GAAP measurements are not intended to be used as a substitute for the related GAAP measurements. The following table shows the calculation of the non-GAAP measurements.

Compar  ison of the three months ended September    3  0  , 2016   to the three months ended   September    3  0  , 2015  : 

Net Interest Income 

The most important source of the Corporation s earnings is net interest income, which is defined as the difference between income on interest-earning assets and the expense of interest-bearing liabilities supporting those assets.  Principal categories of interest-earning assets are loans and securities, while deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt are the principal categories of interest-bearing liabilities.  Demand deposits enhance net interest income because they are noninterest-bearing deposits. For the purpose of this discussion, balance sheet items refer to the average balance for the year and net interest income is adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis.  This tax-equivalent adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax-free assets by increasing the tax-free income by an amount equivalent to the Federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the Corporation s 34% Federal statutory rate.   

Tax equivalent net interest income increased $699   thousand to $9.  4   million in   the third quarter of   2016 compared to $8.  7   million in   the same period   in 2015.    B  alance sheet   volume   contributed $853 thousand to this increase, but was reduced by $154 thousand due to lower rates.       

31   

The following table   presents   average balances,   tax-equivalent (T/E) interest income, and   yields   earned or rates paid on the assets or liabilities.  All nontaxable interest income has been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34%.    

32   

Provision for Loan Losses 

P  rovision expense   for the third quarter was   $  1.1 million, compared to $400 thousand in 2015.        The     increase in the provision expense was due to a higher level of charge-offs and growth in the loan portfolio  .        For more information refer to the Loan Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses discussion in the Financial Condition section. 

Noninterest Income  

For the   third quarter   of 201  6  , noninterest income   de  creased $  180 thousand   from the same period in 201  5  .  Investment and trust service fees   in  creased due to   an increase in recurring fee income in 2016  .    Loan service charges decreased due to higher volume of prepayment penalties   during   the third quarter of 2015.    The change in debit card income was due to increased usage by customers in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.   The loss on the sale of other real estate owned was from the sale of three properties in 2016 compared to none in 2015.   The Corporation recorded an other than temporary impairment (OTTI) charge in 2016   a   none in 2015.  Other income was higher in 2015, due to a $103 thousand gain from the proceeds of a bank owned life insurance policy.   

The following table presents a comparison of noninterest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

33   

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense for the   third quarter   of 201  6     in  creased $  117   thousand compared to the same period in 201  5  .  The   in  crease in salaries and benefits was primarily   due   to a $147 thousand increase in salary expense due to merit increases   and increased staffing levels   and a $227 thousand increase in pension expense due to pension settlement expenses compared to the same period in 2015  .    Legal and professional fees increased due to fees associated with a lawsuit brought against the Corporation in 2015.  This lawsuit was more thoroughly described on a Form 8-K that was filed on July 29, 2016.  It is expected that the Corporation will incur additional legal expenses until this lawsuit is resolved.   Foreclosed real estate expense decreased   due to   $250 thousand   write down   on other real estate owned (OREO) property in 2015  .          

The following table presents a comparison of noninterest expense for the three months ended   September    3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  : 

Provision for Income Taxes 

For the   third quarter   of 201  6  , the Corporation recorded a Federal income tax expense of $  383   thousand compared to $  306   thousand for the same quarter in 201  5  . The effective tax rate   was     15.6  % for the   third   quarter of 201  6   compared to   10.6  % for the same period in 201  5  .    The increase was due to a reduction in pretax income in 2016   from   increased provision expense  . In addition, the   2015   rate was lower than normal due to     the reversal of $250 thousand of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset due to the large security gain on the conversion of Integrity Bancshares.  Without this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 19.3% in 2015.   The variances from the federal statutory rate are generally due to tax-exempt income from investments, loans and bank-owned life insurance.   All taxable income for the Corporation is taxed at a rate of 34%. 

Compar  ison of the nine months ended September    3  0  , 2016   to the   nine   months ended   September    3  0  , 2015  : 

Net Interest Income 

Tax equivalent net interest income increased $1.9 million to $27.4 million in 2016 compared to $25.5 million in 2015.    B  alance sheet   volume   contributed $  2.3   million to this increase, but this was reduced by $369 thousand due to lower rates.    See the Financial Condition discussion for changes in the composition of the balance sheet.

34   

Provision for Loan Losses 

P  rovision expense   for the first nine months of 2016 was   $  3.3 million, compared to $1.0 million in 2015.   The increase in the provision expense was due to a higher level of charge-offs and growth in the loan portfolio   compared.        For more information refer to the Loan Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses discussion in the Financial Condition section. 

Noninterest Income  

For the   first nine months   of 201  6  , noninterest income   de  creased $  1.1 million   from the same period in 201  5  .  Investment and trust service fees   de  creased due to   a decline in estate fees and insurance commissions from 2015 to 2016  .    Loan service charges decreased due to less loan prepayment fees in 2016, compared to 2015.    Deposit service charges   in  creased due to   increased enrollment and use of the Bank s overdraft program  .    The change in debit card income was due to increased usage by customers in 2016.  During 2016, five properties held as other real estate owned were sold with a total net loss, compared to one property sold at a gain in 2015.  The Corporation recorded a nonrecurring gain on the conversion of an investment security in 2015.  Other income in 2015 included a $171 thousand gain from an   investment the Corporation owned in an offshore insurance company that liquidated and paid out the investors  .         

35   

The following table presents a comparison of noninterest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense for the   first     nine months   of 201  6     in  creased $  493   thousand compared to the same period in 201  5  .  The   in  crease in salaries and benefits was primarily   due   to a $436 thousand increase in salary expense due to merit increases   and increased staffing levels  , a $194 thousand increase in pension expense due to pension settlement expenses and $  8  8 thousand for stock option   compensation  .    Legal and professional fees increased due to fees associated with a lawsuit brought against the Corporation in 2015.  This lawsuit was more thoroughly described on a Form 8-K that was filed on July 29, 2016.  It is expected that the Corporation will incur additional legal expenses until this lawsuit is resolved.   The shares tax increase was due to growth in the Bank s balance sheet and shareholders  equity that resulted in a higher premium. Intangible amortization expense decreased as the core deposit intangible was fully amortized as of June 2015.  ATM/Debit card processing increased due to the purchase of EMV debit card inventory  .        Foreclosed real estate expense decreased in 2016, due to a $250 thousand write-down on one property in 2015.  Other expense decreased due to a one-time expense taken in 2015 to fund a deferred director s compensation plan and   several one-time expenses the Bank took   in 2015   related to bra  nch assets taken out of service. 

The following table presents a comparison of noninterest expense for the   nine   months ended   September    3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

Provision for Income Taxes 

For the   first     nine months   of 201  6  , the Corporation recorded a Federal income tax expense of $  1.2 million   compared to $  1.8 million   for the same   period   in 201  5  . The effective tax rate   was     15.8  % for the   first     nine months   of 201  6   compared to   18.3  % for the same period in 201  5  .    The decrease   in 2016   was due to a reduction in pretax income   from   increased provision expense  . In addition, the   2015   rate was lower than normal due to   the reversal of   $250 thousand of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  , due to the large security gain on the conversion of Integrity Bancshares  , established in prior years on other than temporary impairment charges in the equity portfolio.  Without this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 20.9%   in 2015  .     The   variances from the federal statutory rate are generally due to tax-exempt income from investments, loans and bank-owned life insurance.   All taxable income for the Corporation is taxed at a rate of 34%. 

Financial Condition 

Summary  : 

At   September 30  , 201  6  , assets totaled $1.  107     b  illion, an increase of $  71.8   million from the 201  5   year-end balance of   $1.035 b  illion. Investment securities   de  creased $  4.1   million, while net loans   in  creased $  76.0   million   (9.8%)   due to growth in the commercial loan portfolio  . Deposits   increased    $  60.0   million   (6.5%)   during   the first nine months   of 201  6   due to   increases in every deposit category except time deposits  . Shareholders  equity increased $  5.5   million during the first   nine   months as retained earnings increased $  3.7     million, accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased    $  1.2 million   and the Corporation s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) added an additional $  1.1 million   in new capital.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $  40.6   million at   September 30  , 201  6,    a  n     in  crease of $  1.4   million from the prior year-end balance of $  39.2   million.    Interest-bearing deposits are held primarily at the Federal Reserve   ($1.1 million) and in short-term bank owned certificates of deposit ($22.6 million). 

Investment Securities:       

The investment portfolio has decreased $5.7 million on a cost basis, since year-end 2015. The composition of the portfolio has remained consistent with municipal securities and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities comprising the greatest portion of the portfolio at approximately 44% and 43% of the portfolio fair value, respectively. The Bank invested $16.6 million during the first nine months of 2016 with the purchases spread between, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities.  The average life of the portfolio was 3.74 years.   

The investment portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $2.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 million at the prior year-end. The increase in the unrealized gain is due primarily to the decline in intermediate and long term interest rates.  The portfolio averaged $159.2 million with a yield of 2.82% for the first nine months of 2016. This compares to an average of $175.2 million and a yield of 2.84% for the same period in 2015.   

The Bank holds only one equity security, a Pennsylvania community bank. The municipal bond portfolio is well diversified geographically (issuers from within 28 states) and is comprised primarily of general obligation bonds (75%).  Many municipal bonds have credit enhancements in the form of private bond insurance or other credit support. The largest geographic municipal bond exposure is to 16 issuers in the state of Pennsylvania with a fair value of $9.0 million and 14 issuers in the state of Texas with a fair value of $8.7 million. The average rating of the municipal portfolio from Moody s is Aa2. It contains $68.1 million of bonds rated A3 or higher and one bond of $600 thousand that is not rated by Moody s rating agency.  No municipal bonds are rated below investment grade.  

The holdings of trust preferred investments and private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLMBS) are unchanged since year-end and are detailed in separate tables. 

37   

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows  : 

The investment portfolio contained fifty securities with $29.0 million of temporarily impaired fair value and $756 thousand in unrealized losses at September 30, 2016. The total unrealized loss position has improved from a $1.3 million unrealized loss at year-end 2015.   

For securities with an unrealized loss, Management applies a systematic methodology in order to perform an assessment of the potential for other-than-temporary impairment.  In the case of debt securities, investments considered for other-than-temporary impairment: (1) had a specified maturity or repricing date; (2) were generally expected to be redeemed at par, and (3) were expected to achieve a recovery in market value within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the Bank considers whether it intends to sell these securities or whether it will be forced to sell these securities before the earlier of amortized cost recovery or maturity. Equity securities are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment based on the length of time of impairment, dollar amount of the impairment and general market and financial conditions relating to specific issues.  The impairment identified on debt and equity securities and subject to assessment at September 30, 2016, was deemed to be temporary and required no further adjustments to the financial statements, unless otherwise noted.  

38   

The following table reflects temporary impairment in the investment portfolio (excluding restricted stock), aggregated by investment category, length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and the number of securities in each category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The unrealized loss in the municipal bond portfolio decreased to $92 thousand from $218 thousand at December 31, 2015 as market prices improved during the quarter.  There are three securities in this portfolio with an unrealized loss and the loss in this portfolio is deemed to be non-credit related and no other-than-temporary impairment charges have been recorded.  

The trust preferred portfolio contains seven securities with a fair value of $5.4 million and an unrealized loss of $555 thousand The trust-preferred securities held by the Bank are single entity issues, not pooled trust preferred securities.  Therefore, the impairment review of these securities is based only on the issuer and the security cannot be impaired by the performance of other issuers as if it was a pooled trust-preferred bond. All of the Bank s trust preferred securities are single issue, variable rate notes with long maturities (2027   2028).  None of these bonds have suspended or missed a dividend payment. At September 30, 2016, the Bank believes it will be able to collect all interest and principal due on these bonds     and no other-than-temporary-impairment charges were recorded.   

There is one PLMBS bond showing a small unrealized loss of $7 thousand.  However, the PLMBS sector as a whole is showing an unrealized gain of $50 thousand at quarter end.  This is primarily a result of the cumulative OTTI charges recorded on this portfolio.  Due to the nature of these bonds, they are evaluated closely. These bonds were all rated AAA at time of purchase, but have since experienced rating declines. Some have experienced increased delinquencies and defaults, while others have seen the credit support increase as the bonds paid-down. The Bank monitors the performance of the PLMBS investments on a regular basis and reviews delinquencies, default rates, credit support levels and various cash flow stress test scenarios. In determining the credit related loss, Management considers all principal past due 60 days or more as a loss. If additional principal moves beyond 60 days past due, it will also be considered a loss.  The Bank recorded a $30 thousand impairment charge during the first nine months of 2016 and has recorded $585 thousand of cumulative impairment charges on this portfolio. Management continues to monitor these securities and it is possible that additional write-downs may occur if current loss trends continue.  

39   

The Bank held $1.1 million of restricted stock at September 30, 2016.  Except for $30 thousand, this investment represents stock in FHLB Pittsburgh. The Bank is required to hold this stock to be a member of FHLB and it is carried at cost of $100 per share. The level of FHLB stock held is determined by FHLB and is comprised of a minimum membership amount plus a variable activity amount. FHLB stock is evaluated for impairment primarily based on an assessment of the ultimate recoverability of its cost. As a government sponsored entity, FHLB has the ability to raise funding through the U.S. Treasury that can be used to support its operations.  There is not a public market for FHLB stock and the benefits of FHLB membership (e.g., liquidity and low cost funding) add value to the stock beyond purely financial measures. Management intends to remain a member of the FHLB and believes that it will be able to fully recover the cost basis of this investment.  

Loans:       

Residential real estate:    This category is comprised of consumer purpose loans secured by residential real estate and to a lesser extent, commercial purpose loans secured by residential real estate.  The consumer purpose category represents traditional residential mortgage loans and home   equity products (primarily junior liens and lines of credit).   Commercial purpose loans in this category represent loans made for various business needs, but are secured with residential real estate. In addition to the real estate collateral, it is possible that additional security is provided by personal guarantees or UCC filings. These loans are underwritten as commercial loans and are not originated to be sold. 

Total residential real estate loans   increased $  3.2 million   over 201  5  , primarily in the commercial first lien and consumer junior liens and lines of credit categories   due to a home equity special promotion in 2015 and 2016  .  For the first   nine   months of 201  6  , the Bank originated   $  10.2   million in   mortgages, including   approximately $  6.6   million for   a fee through a third party brokerage agreement. The Bank   does not originate or hold any loans that would be considered sub-prime or Alt-A, and does not generally originate mortgages outside of its primary market area.  

Residential real estate construction:    The largest component of this category represents loans to residential real estate developers ($  7.1   million), while loans for individuals to construct personal residences totaled $  1.6 million   at   September   3  0  , 201  6  .  The Bank s exposure to residential construction loans is concentrated primarily in south central Pennsylvania.  

Real estate construction loans,   including residential real estate and   land development loans,   occasionally   provide an interest reserve in order to assist the developer during the development stage when minimal cash flow is generated. All real estate construction loans are underwritten in the same manner, regardless of the use of an interest reserve.   At September 30, 2016,   the Bank had $  7  .  3   million in residential real estate construction loans funded with an interest reserve and capitalized $  93   thousand of interest   from these reserves on active projects.    Real estate construction loans are monitored on a regular basis by either an independent third party inspector or the assigned loan officer depending on loan amount or complexity of the project. This monitoring process includes at a minimum, the submission of invoices and AIA documents of costs incurred by the borrower, on-site inspections, and a signature by the assigned loan officer for disbursement of funds.       

Commercial real estate   (CRE)  :     This category includes commercial, industrial, farm and agricultural loans, where real estate serves as the primary collateral for the loans  . Total commercial   real estate   loans   in  creased to $  375.3   million from $  340.7   million at the end of   201  5, an increase of $34.6   million.  The increases were primarily in commercial construction   and   multi-family units. The largest secto  rs (by collateral) in the commercial real estate category are: office buildings ($57.7 million), hotels and motels ($45.7 million), land development ($42.9 million), apartment units ($37.3 million), and auto dealerships ($32.8 million).    

Commercial     (C I):        This category includes commercial, industrial, farm, agricultural, and   municipal loans.  C I loans increased $  38  .  3   million to $2  54  .3 million at   September   30, 2016, compared to $215.9 million at the end of 2015  , primarily in the municipal loan portfolio  . The largest sectors (by industry) in the commercial loan category are: retail trade ($2  5  .  3   million),   manufacturing   ($1  5  .  8   million) and health care ($15.  6   million).  At   September   30, 2016, the Bank had $1  37  .  8   million in municipal loans. The   Ba  nk is   very   active in its market in pursuing commercial lending opportunities, but   has historically   supplement  ed   in-market growth with purchased loan participations  , when appropriate  . The Bank purchases commercial loan participations in an effort to increase its commercial lending and diversify its loan mix, both geographically and by industry sector.  Purchased loans are originated primarily within the south central Pennsylvania market   and are purchased from only a few select counter parties. For the first   nine   months of 201  6  , the Bank   purchased $1  2  .  2   million of   loan   participations and commitments.  At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank   held $132.  0   million in   purchased loan participations in its portfolio.       

Consumer loans decreased $  381   thousand due primarily   to regular payments and maturities.   The majority of the Bank s consumer loans, approximately $3.0 million, are personal lines of credit.   The   Bank believes the   consumer portfolio will continue to   decline  .

The following table   presents   a summary of loans outstanding, by primary collateral as of: 

Loan Quality  :    

Management utilizes a risk rating scale ranging from 1 (Prime) to 9 (Loss) to evaluate loan quality. This risk rating scale is used primarily for commercial purpose loans. Consumer purpose loans are identified as either a pass or substandard rating. Substandard consumer loans are loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing.  Loans rated 1   4 are considered pass credits. Loans that are rated 5 are pass credits, but have been identified as credits that are likely to warrant additional attention and monitoring. Loans rated 6 (Special Mention) or worse begin to receive enhanced monitoring and reporting by the Bank. Loans rated 7 (Substandard) or 8 (Doubtful) exhibit the greatest financial weakness and present the greatest possible risk of loss to the Bank. Nonaccrual loans are rated no better than 7.   The following factors represent some of the factors used in determining the risk rating of a borrower: cash flow, debt coverage, liquidity, management, and collateral. Risk ratings, for pass credits, are generally reviewed annually for term debt and at renewal for revolving or renewing debt. The Bank monitors loan quality by reviewing four measurements: (1) loans rated 6 or worse (collectively  watch list ), (2) delinquent loans, (3) other real estate owned (OREO), and (4) net-charge-offs. Management compares trends in these measurements with the Bank s internally established targets, as well as its national peer group. 

Watch list loans exhibit financial weaknesses that increase the potential risk of default or loss to the Bank. However, inclusion on the watch list, does not by itself, mean a loss is certain. The watch list totaled $23.1 million at quarter end and includes both performing and nonperforming loans.  It is comprised of $4.4 million rated 6 and $18.7 million rated 7. The Bank has no loans rated 8-doubtful or 9-loss. The watch list totaled $27.3 million at June 30, 2016 and $27.9 million at the prior year-end. The decrease in the watch list from year-end, and the prior quarter  is due primarily to a $5.6 million credit (year-end balance) that was partially charged-off in 2016 and sold during the third quarter of 2016 (see the Allowance for Loan Losses discussion).  The credit composition of the portfolio, by primary collateral is shown in Note 7 of the accompanying financial statements. The Bank s Loan Management Committee reviews these loans and risk ratings on a quarterly basis in order to proactively identify and manage problem loans. In addition, a committee meets monthly to discuss possible workout strategies for OREO and all credits rated 7 or worse. Management also tracks other commercial loan risk measurements including high loan to value loans, concentrations, participations and policy exceptions and reports these to the Credit Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors. The Bank also uses a third-party consultant to assist with internal loan review with a goal of reviewing 60% of commercial loans each year. The FDIC defines certain supervisory loan-to-value lending limits.  The Bank s internal loan to-value limits are all equal to, or have  

41   

a lower loan-to-value limit, than the supervisory   limits.  At September 30, 2016, the Bank had loans of $  18.5   million that exceeded the supervisory limit. 

Delinquent loans are a result of borrowers  cash flow and/or alternative sources of cash being insufficient to repay loans.  The Bank s likelihood of collateral liquidation to repay the loans becomes more probable the further behind a borrower falls, particularly when loans reach 90 days or more past due. Management monitors the performance status of loans by the use of an aging report. The aging report can provide an early indicator of loans that may become severely delinquent and possibly result in a loss to the Bank.    See Note 6 in the   accompanying financial statements for a note that presents the aging of payments in the loan portfolio.  

Nonaccruing loans generally represent Management s determination that the borrower will be unable to repay the loan in accordance with its contractual terms and that collateral liquidation may or may not fully repay both interest and principal. It is the Bank s policy to evaluate the probable collectability of principal and interest due under terms of loan contracts for all loans 90-days or more, nonaccrual loans, or impaired loans. Further, it is the Bank s policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans that are not adequately secured and in the process of collection.  Upon determination of nonaccrual status, the Bank subtracts any current year accrued and unpaid interest from its income, and any prior year accrued and unpaid interest from the allowance for loan losses.  Management continually monitors the status of nonperforming loans, the value of any collateral and potential of risk of loss.  Nonaccrual loans are rated no better than 7 (Substandard). 

42   

Loan quality, as measured by the balance of nonperforming loans, has declined from year-end.  The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets:  

43   

The following table identifies the most significant loans in nonaccrual status. These three nonaccrual loans account for 8  0  % of the total nonaccrual balance. The table also indicates those significant nonaccrual loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A TDR loan is maintained on nonaccrual status until a satisfactory repayment history is established.  All loans on the watch list that are not on nonaccrual or past due 90 days more are considered potential problem loans. Potential problem loans at September 30, 2016 totaled $17.1 million compared to $22.1 million at year-end 2015. 

(1) Appraisal value, as reported, does not reflect the pay-off of any senior liens or the cost to liquidate the collateral, but does reflect only the Bank s share of the collateral if it is a participated loan.  

Credit 1 is a TDR that is performing in accordance with the modified terms. Credit 2 is a hotel and entertainment complex being operated as part of an estate liquidation and is currently listed for sale. Credit 3is a new nonaccrual loan as a result of a TDR default.  

In addition to monitoring nonaccrual loans, the Bank also closely monitors impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (TDR).  A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments due according to the originally contracted terms of the loan agreement.  Nonaccrual loans and TDR loans are always considered impaired. For impaired commercial loans with balances less than $250 thousand and all consumer purpose loans, a specific reserve analysis is not performed and these loans are added to the general allocation pool. In accordance with financial accounting standards, TDR loans are always considered impaired until they are paid off.  However, an impaired TDR loan can be a performing loan. Impaired loans totaled $15.7 million at quarter-end compared to $16.8 million at year-end 2015.  

A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the creditor (the Bank), for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions may include lowering the rate, extending the maturity, reamortization of the payment, or a combination of multiple concessions.   The Bank reviews all loans rated 6 or worse when it is providing a loan restructure, modification or new credit facility to determine if the action is a TDR.  If a TDR loan is placed on nonaccrual status, it remains on nonaccrual status for at least six months to ensure performance. All TDR loans are in compliance with their modified terms. See Note 6 in the accompanying financial statements for information on TDR loans in the portfolio.

The following table shows the composition of impaired loans as of: 

Allowance for Loan Losses:    

Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (ALL). The ALL is determined by segmenting the loan portfolio based on the loan s collateral. The Bank further classifies the portfolio based on the primary purpose of the loan, either consumer or commercial.  When calculating the ALL, consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews, historical charge-offs, the adequacy of the underlying collateral (if collateral dependent) and other relevant factors. The Bank begins enhanced monitoring of all loans rated 6 (OAEM) or worse, and obtains a new appraisal or asset valuation for any loan rated 7 (substandard) or worse. Management, at its discretion, may determine that additional adjustments to the appraisal or valuation are required.  Valuation adjustments will be made as necessary based on factors, including, but not limited to: the economy, deferred maintenance, industry, type of property/equipment, age of the appraisal, etc. and the knowledge Management has about a particular situation. In addition, the cost to sell or liquidate the collateral is also estimated and deducted from the valuation in order to determine the net realizable value to the Bank.     When determining the allowance for loan losses, certain factors involved in the evaluation are inherently subjective and require material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Management monitors the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on an ongoing basis and reports its adequacy quarterly to the Credit Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors.  Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 is adequate. 

The analysis for determining the ALL is consistent with guidance set forth in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The analysis has two components, specific and general allocations. The specific component addresses specific reserves established for impaired loans. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments due according to the originally contracted terms of the loan agreement.  Collateral values discounted for market conditions and selling costs are used to establish specific allocations for impaired loans. It is possible that as a result of the credit analysis, a specific reserve is not required for an impaired loan. For impaired commercial loans with balances less than $250 thousand and all consumer purpose loans, a specific reserve analysis is not performed and these loans are added to the general allocation pool. At September 30, 2016, impaired loans totaled $15.7 million compared to $16.8 million at year-end 2015.  The Bank does not have a specific reserve established for any of its impaired loans. At year-end 2015, the Bank had one impaired loan with a specific reserve of $9 thousand that paid-off during the first quarter of 2016. Note 6 in the accompanying financial statements provide additional information about the ALL established for impaired loans. 

The general allocation component addresses the reserves established for pools of homogenous loans. The general component includes a quantitative and qualitative analysis. When calculating the general allocation, the Bank segregates its loan portfolio into the following sectors based primarily on the type of supporting collateral:  residential real estate, commercial, industrial or agricultural real estate; commercial and industrial (C I non-real estate), and consumer.  The residential real estate sector is further segregated by first lien loans, junior liens and home equity products, and residential real estate construction. The quantitative analysis uses the Bank s twenty quarter rolling historical loan loss experience adjusted for factors derived from current economic and market conditions that have been determined to have an effect on the probability and magnitude of a loss. Prior to 2015, the Bank was using an eight quarter rolling history for the quantitative analysis. The change to a longer historical period is based upon improving charge-offs and a more stable and slowly improving economy.   As credit quality improved the Bank began to see lower charge-offs.  The Bank believes that  

45   

an eight quarter historical period presented the loss history during a very favorable period and it may not accurately reflect historical trends.  It believes that a twenty quarter period covers a longer economic cycle and more accurately reflects its loss history and therefore is a more appropriate factor for calculating the general reserve in the current environment.  The historical loss experience factor for the general allocation was 1.02% of gross loans ($8.8 million) at September 30, 2016 compared to 1.07% and $8.4 million at the prior year-end.  Included in the general loan loss reserve is an unallocated reserve of $1.3 million, unchanged from December 31, 2015.  

The qualitative analysis utilizes a risk matrix that incorporates qualitative and environmental factors such as: loan volume, management, loan review process, credit concentrations, competition, and legal and regulatory issues. These factors are each risk rated from minimal to high risk and in total can add up to a maximum qualitative factor of 37.5 basis points. At quarter-end, this factor was 22.5 basis points compared to 21.5 at year-end 2015.  These factors are determined on the basis of Management s observation, judgment and experience.   

Real estate appraisals and collateral valuations are an important part of the Bank s process for determining potential loss on collateral dependent loans and thereby have a direct effect on the determination of loan reserves, charge-offs and the calculation of the allowance for loan losses.  As long as the loan remains a performing loan, no further updates to appraisals are required. If a loan or relationship migrates to risk rating of 7 or worse, an evaluation for impairment status is made based on the current information available at the time of downgrade and a new appraisal or collateral valuation is obtained.  

In determining the allowance for loan losses, Management, at its discretion, may determine that additional adjustments to the fair value obtained from an appraisal or collateral valuation are required. Adjustments will be made as necessary based on factors, including, but not limited to the economy, deferred maintenance, industry, type of property or equipment etc., and the knowledge Management has about a particular situation. In addition, the cost to sell or liquidate the collateral is also estimated and deducted from the valuation in order to determine the net realizable value to the Bank. If an appraisal is not available, Management may make its best estimate of the real value of the collateral or use last known market value and apply appropriate discounts.  If an adjustment is made to the collateral valuation, this will be documented with appropriate support and reported to the Loan Management Committee. 

46   

The following table shows the loans that were evaluated for the allowance for loan losses under a specific reserve (individually) and those that were evaluated under a general reserve (collectively), and the amount of the allowance established in each loan class as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

During the first nine months of 2016, the Bank recorded $3.3 million for the loan loss provision expense compared to $1.0 thousand during the prior year.  Charged-off loans usually result from: (1) a borrower being legally relieved of loan repayment responsibility through bankruptcy,     (2)     insufficient collateral sale proceeds to repay a loan; or (3) the borrower and/or guarantor does not own other assets that, if sold, would generate sufficient sale proceeds to repay a loan. The Bank recorded net loan charg  e-offs of $2.7 million for the first nine   months of 2016. 

At December 31, 2015, Special Mention loans included a $5.4 million commercial real estate loan.   The loan represented the Bank s portion of a participated loan transaction where the Bank was not the lead lender  .    The Bank placed the loan on nonaccrual at March 31, 2016 with a specific loan loss reserve of $74 thousand. The reserve was determined using a September 2015 property appraisal obtained by the lead bank that showed a collateral value in excess of $19.0 million. Based on its ownership percentage, the Bank discounted the appraised value by 30% plus costs, to calculate its specific loan loss reserve. The bank group subsequently negotiated a forbearance agreement with the borrower that required the sale of the property.  A specialty broker was engaged by the lead bank to provide an opinion of value and to sell the property. The broker s opinion of value was less than half the September 2015 appraised value. Due to the significant decline in value since the 2015 appraisal, the Bank raised questions about the broker s valuation with the bank group.   Despite objections raised by the Bank, the lead bank listed the property at a price consistent with the broker s valuation.  This decision resulted in a $1.9 million charge-off on this credit during the s  econd quarter of 2016.    During the third quarter of 2016, the bank group agreed to sell the loan and this decision resulted in an additional $759 thousand charge-off.  Overall, the total charge-off on this credit, $2.7 million, accounted for 91% of the total gross charge-offs of $3.0 million in 2016.

The following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods ended:  

Other Real Estate Owned:    

The Bank holds $5.8 million of other real estate owned (OREO), comprised of four properties compared to $6.5 million and seven properties at December 31, 2015.  The most significant OREO holdings are listed in the table below. Property 1 was part of a participated loan and the workout is being handled by the lead bank.  In early May 2016, an agreement of sale was executed.  The agreement allows for a lengthy due diligence and approval process prior to settlement.  Therefore, the final outcome is not certain.  Property 2 was part of a participated loan and the workout is being handled by the lead bank.  During 2016  , the Bank sold five properties for a loss of $31 thousand, recorded   a write down of $46 thousand on one property and incurred expense of $  4  7 thousand to hold and maintain OREO. Note 7 of the accompanying financial statements provides additional information on activity in OREO. 

The following table provides additional information on significant other real estate owned properties: 

At   September   3  0  , 201  6  , the   Bank   had $  349   thousand   of residential properties in the process of foreclosure compared to $  218     thousand   at the end of 201  5  . 

48   

Deposits:   

Total deposits increased $  60.0   million during the first   nine months   of 201  6   to $  978.6   million. Non-interest bearing deposits   in  creased $  22.3   million, while savings and interest-bearing checking increased $  46.2   million and time deposits   de  creased $  8.4 million  . The   in  crease in non-inte  rest bearing checking accounts occurred   primarily   in     state/municipal accounts ($11.4 million) and small business checking accounts ($10.6 million)  .    Interest bearing checking increased by $13.1 million, primarily from commercial deposits.    The Bank s Money Management product   increased $26.9 million, primarily from state/municipal deposits  .        Retail time deposits decreased since year-end, as customers moved funds to more liquid accounts.  As of   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank had $  3  .  3   million in CDARS reciprocal   time   deposits included in brokered time deposits.    

Borrowings: 

The Corporation had short-term borrowings of $  8  .5 million   at September 30, 2016 and no   borrowings at September 30, 2015.   

Shareholders  Equity: 

Total shareholders  equity increased $  5.5   million to $  116.9   million at   September    3  0  , 201  6  , compared to $  111.4   million at the end of 201  5  .  The increase in retained earnings from the Corporation s net income of $  6.4   million was partially offset by the cash dividend of $  2.6 million  . The Corporation s dividend payout ratio is   41  .  1  % for the first   nine months   of 201  6   compared to   29  .  4%   in 201  5  .   

As part of its quarterly dividend decision, the Corporation considers current and future income projections, dividend yield, payout ratio, and current   and future capital ratios  . Year-to-date, the Corporation paid dividends of $0.  61   per share, compared to $  0  .  55   for the same period in 201  5  ,    a 10.9  % increase.  For the   third   quarter of 201  6  , the Corporation paid a $  0  .  21   per share dividend, compared to $  0  .1  9   paid in the   third   quarter of 201  5  .    On   October 13, 2016   the Board of Directors declared a $0.  2  1 per share regu  lar quarterly dividend for the fourth   quarter of 201  6  , which will be paid on   November 23  , 201  6  . 

In addition, the Corporation considers how dividend decisions may affect the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP), which has raised $  1.1 million   in new capital this year with   49  ,  401   new shares purchased.    On April 14, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $350,000 in shares of common stock during each calendar quarter   through March 31, 2017. In   2016, the Corporation repurchased   30  ,  196   shares of its common stock for $  700   thousand.

In July 2013, Federal banking regulators approved the final rules from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for the regulation of capital requirements for bank holding companies and U.S banks, generally referred to as  Basel III.  The Basel III standards were effective for the Corporation and the Bank, effective January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions).  Basel III imposes significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios than those previously in place.  The capital ratios to be considered  well capitalized  under Basel III are: (1) Common Equity Tier 1(CET1) of 6.5%, (2) Tier 1 Leverage of 5%, (3)Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital of 8%, and (4) Total Risk-Based Capital of 10%.  The CET1 ratio is a new capital ratio under Basel III and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% has been increased from 6%. The rules also include changes in the risk weights of certain assets to better reflect credit and other risk exposures. In addition, a capital conservation buffer will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625%, increasing each year until fully implemented in 2019 at 2.5% above the minimum capital ratios required to avoid any capital distribution restrictions. The capital conservation buffer will be applicable to all of the capital ratios except for the Tier1 Leverage ratio. When fully implemented, the capital conservation buffer will have the effect of increasing the minimum capital ratios by 2.5%.  As of September 30, 2016, the Bank was  well capitalized  under the Basel III requirements and believes it would be  well capitalized  on a fully-phased in basis had such a requirement been in effect.  

The following table summarizes regulatory capital   information as of   September    3  0  , 201  6 and December 31, 2015 (restated) for the Corporation and the Bank  .    The adequately capitalized minimum ratios, except for the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, include the 0.625% Capital Conservation buffer effective for 2016. 

Economy    

The Corporation s primary market area includes Franklin, Fulton, Cumberland and Huntingdon County, PA.  This area is diverse in demographic and economic makeup.  County populations range from a low of approximately 1  5  ,000 in Fulton County to over 2  38,  000 in Cumberland County. Unemployment in the Bank s market area has remained virtually unchanged over the past year and ranges from a low of   4  .  7  % in Cumberland County to high of   7.1  % in   Huntingdon   County.  The market area has a diverse economic base and local industries include warehousing, truck   rail shipping centers, light and heavy manufacturers, health-care, higher education institutions, farming and agriculture, and a varied service sector.  The Corporation s primary market area is located in south central Pennsylvania and provides easy access to the major metropolitan markets on the east coast via trucking and rail transportation. Because of this, warehousing and distribution companies continue to find the area attractive. The local economy is not overly dependent on any one industry  

50   

or business and Management believes that the Bank s primary market area continues to be well suited for growth as the recession eases.  

The following provides selected economic data for the Bank s primary market: 

Economic Data 

Unlike many companies, the assets and liabilities of the Corporation are financial in nature. As such, interest rates and changes in interest rates may have a more significant effect on the Corporation s financial results than on other types of industries  . Because of this, the Corporation watches the actions of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) as it makes decisions about interest rate changes  . The FOMC   continues to hold short-term rates at historic lows.  It continues to monitor employment and inflation data as it considers the timing of an increase in the Fed Funds rate.   

Liquidity 

The Corporation must meet the financial needs of the customers that it serves, while providing a satisfactory return on the shareholders  investment.  In order to accomplish this, the Corporation must maintain sufficient liquidity in order to respond quickly to the changing level of funds required for both loan and deposit activity.  The goal of liquidity management is to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of depositors who want to withdraw funds and of borrowers who request loan disbursements. The Bank regularly reviews it liquidity position by measuring its projected net cash flows (in and out) at a 30 and 90-day interval.  The Bank stresses this measurement by assuming a level of deposit out-flows that have not historically been realized. In addition to this forecast, other funding sources are reviewed as a method to provide emergency funding if necessary.  The objective of this measurement is to identify the amount of cash that could be raised quickly without the need to liquidate assets.  The Bank also stresses its liquidity position utilizing different longer-term scenarios.  The varying degrees of stress create pressure on deposit flows in its local market, reduce access to wholesale funding and limit access of funds available through brokered deposit channels. In addition to stressing cash flow, specific liquidity risk indicators are monitored to help identify risk areas.  This analysis will help identify and quantify the potential cash surplus/deficit over a variety of time horizons to ensure the Bank has adequate funding resources.  Assumptions used for liquidity stress testing are subjective.  Should an evolving liquidity situation or business cycle present new data, potential assumption changes will be considered.  The Bank believes it can meet all anticipated liquidity demands. 

Historically, the Corporation has satisfied its liquidity needs from earnings, repayment of loans and amortizing investment securities, maturing investment securities, loan` sales, deposit growth and its ability to access existing lines of credit.  All investment securities are classified as available for sale; therefore, securities that are not pledged as collateral for borrowings are an additional source of readily available liquidity, either by selling the security or, more preferably, to provide collateral for additional borrowing. At   September   3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank had approximately $  86.0   million (fair value) in its investment portfolio pledged as collateral for deposits.  Another source of available liquidity for the Bank is a line of credit with the FHLB.  At   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank had approximately $  130   million available on this line of credit and $6  .0   million of unsecured lines of   credit at a correspondent bank. A  t    September   3  0  , 201  6  , the Bank had an excess borrowing capacity   at FHLB   of $  266.7   million, which includes the amount available on the line of credit.  The Bank has  

51   

established credit at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and as of quarter-end had the ability to borrow approximately $  23   million.   

Off Balance Sheet Commitments 

The Corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk.  These commitments consist mainly of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments.  Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not   generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Corporation  .  Unused commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $  299.1   million and   $291.4   million, respectively, at   September    3  0  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  . 

The Corporation has entered into various contractual obligations to make future payments.  These obligations include time deposits, long-term debt, operating leases, deferred compensation and pension payments.  These amounts have not changed materially from those reported in the Corporation s 201  5   Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

Item   3  .  Quantitative and Qualitative     Disclosures about   Market Risk 

There were no material changes in the Corporation s exposure to market risk during the   nine     months ended   September    3  0  , 201  6  . For more information on market risk refer to the Corporation s 201  5   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4.  Controls   and Pr    ocedures 

Evaluation of Controls and Procedures 

The Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon the evaluation, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September    3  0  , 201  6  , the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.   There were no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended   September    3  0  , 201  6  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. 

The management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Part II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.             Legal Proceedings 

The nature of the Corporation s business generates a certain amount of litigation involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including the matter disclosed in our Form 8-K filed July 29, 2016.  In management s opinion, we do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position.  We cannot now determine, however, whether or not any claims asserted against us, including the disclosed matter, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period. In addition, no material proceedings are pending or are known to be threatened or contemplated against us by governmental authorities. 

Item 1A.     Risk Factors   

There were no material changes in the Corporation s risk factors during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For more information, refer to the Corporation s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2.     Unregistered  Sales of Equity     Securities and Use of Proceeds  

The Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan on April 14, 2016 that authorizes the repurchase of up to $350,000 in shares of common stock during each calendar quarter through March 31, 2017.   

As of September 30, 2016, 30,196 shares have been purchased under this plan.  The following table reports stock repurchases made during the 2016 and total shares repurchased under this plan:
