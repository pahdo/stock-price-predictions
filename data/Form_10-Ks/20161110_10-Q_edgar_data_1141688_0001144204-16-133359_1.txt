  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.    Interim Financial Statements  

The unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Landmark Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) and its subsidiary, Landmark National Bank (the  Bank ),
have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements and should be read in
conjunction with the Company s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, containing the latest audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto. The consolidated financial statements in this report have not been audited by an independent registered
public accounting firm, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, considered
necessary for a fair presentation of financial statements have been reflected herein. The results of the nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other period.
The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure up to the date the financial statements were issued. 

2.    Investments  

A summary of investment securities
available-for-sale is as follows: 

The tables above show that
some of the securities in the available-for-sale investment portfolio had unrealized losses, or were temporarily impaired, as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This temporary impairment represents the estimated amount of loss that would be realized
if the securities were sold on the valuation date. Securities which were temporarily impaired are shown below, along with the length
of time in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

The Company s U.S.
federal agency portfolio consists of securities issued by the government-sponsored agencies of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
( FHLMC ), Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ).
The receipt of principal and interest on U.S. federal agency obligations is guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored agency
guarantor, such that the Company believes that its U.S. federal agency obligations do not expose the Company to credit-related
losses. Based on these factors, along with the Company s intent to not sell the securities and its belief that it was more
likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis, the Company believed
that the U.S. federal agency obligations identified in the tables above were temporarily impaired as of the date of the respective
table. 

The Company s portfolio
of municipal obligations consists of both tax-exempt and taxable general obligations securities issued by various municipalities.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not intend to sell and it was more likely than not that the Company will not be required
to sell its municipal obligations in an unrealized loss position until the recovery of their costs. Due to the issuers  continued
satisfaction of the securities  obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and the expectation that they will
continue to do so, the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers  financial condition and other objective evidence, the
Company believed that the municipal obligations identified in the tables above were temporarily impaired as of the date of the
respective table. 

The Company s agency
mortgage-backed securities portfolio consists of securities underwritten to the standards of and guaranteed by the government-sponsored
agencies of FHLMC, FNMA and the Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ). The receipt of principal, at par,
and interest on agency mortgage-backed securities is guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored agency guarantor, such that
the Company believed that its agency mortgage-backed securities did not expose the Company to credit-related losses. Based on these
factors, along with the Company s intent to not sell the securities and the Company s belief that it was more likely
than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis, the Company believed
that the agency mortgage-backed securities identified in the tables above were temporarily impaired as of the date of the respective
table. 

The table below of the
amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities includes scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments,
based on observable market inputs, for agency mortgage-backed securities. Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities
because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. The amortized cost and fair value
of investment securities at September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

Sales proceeds and gross realized gains and
losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are as follows for the periods indicated: 

Securities with carrying
values of $204.5 million and $171.6 million were pledged to secure public funds on deposit, repurchase agreements and as collateral
for borrowings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Except for U.S. federal agency obligations, no investment
in a single issuer exceeded 10% of consolidated stockholders  equity. 

3.    Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses  

Loans consisted of the
following as of the dates indicated below: 

The following tables provide
information on the Company s activity in the allowance for loan losses by loan class: 

The following tables provide information on
the Company s activity in the allowance for loan losses by loan class and allowance methodology: 

The
Company recorded net loan charge-offs of $915,000 during the first nine months of 2016 compared to net loan recoveries of $1.3
million during the first nine months of 2015. The net loan charge-offs during the first nine months of 2016 were primarily related
to an agriculture loan relationship which was subject to a trouble debt restructuring ( TDR ) and the liquidation of
the assets securing a previously identified and impaired commercial loan. The charge-off associated with this commercial loan exceeded
the related allowance recorded at March 31, 2016, which contributed to the provision for loan losses during the second quarter
of 2016. The net loan recoveries during the first nine months of 2015 were primarily associated with the recovery of $1.7 million
on a $4.3 million construction loan which was fully charged-off during 2010 and 2011. As of September 30, 2016,  the Company
has recovered approximately $2.4 million of the loan and continues to pursue collection of the remaining amount. 

The Company s impaired loans decreased from $6.8 million at
December 31, 2015 to $6.1 million at September 30, 2016. The difference between the unpaid contractual principal and the impaired
loan balance is a result of charge-offs recorded against impaired loans. The difference in the Company s non-accrual loan
balances and impaired loan balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was related to TDRs that are current and accruing
interest, but still classified as impaired. Interest income recognized on a cash basis was immaterial during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The following tables present
information on impaired loans: 

The Company s key
credit quality indicator is a loan s performance status, defined as accruing or non-accruing. Performing loans are considered
to have a lower risk of loss. Non-accrual loans are those which the Company believes have a higher risk of loss. The accrual of
interest on non-performing loans is discontinued at the time the loan is ninety days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured
and in process of collection. Loans are placed on non-accrual or are charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal
or interest is considered doubtful. There were no loans ninety days delinquent and accruing interest at September 30, 2016 or December
31, 2015. 

The following tables present
information on the Company s past due and non-accrual loans by loan class: 

Under the original terms
of the Company s non-accrual loans, interest earned on such loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 would
have increased interest income by $43,000 and $121,000, respectively. No interest income related to non-accrual loans was included
in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company also categorizes
loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to service their debt such as current
financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among
other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on
a quarterly basis. Non-classified loans generally include those loans that are expected to be repaid in accordance with contractual
loan terms. Classified loans are those that are assigned a special mention, substandard or doubtful risk rating using the following
definitions: 

Special Mention: Loans are currently
protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged but such protection is potentially
weak. These loans constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard.
The credit risk may be relatively minor, yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific
asset. 

Substandard: Loans are inadequately protected by the current
net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. Loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that
jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some
loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful: Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses
inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full,
on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

The following table
provides information on the Company s risk categories by loan class: 

At September 30, 2016,
the Company had eleven loan relationships consisting of seventeen outstanding loans that were classified as TDRs. During the third
quarter of 2016, the Company classified a $302,000 agriculture loan relationship consisting of three loans as a TDR after extending
the maturities of the loans. The collateral securing the loans was deemed to be insufficient, resulting in a charge-off of $215,000.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company classified an $8,000 commercial loan as a TDR after modifying the payments to interest
only. Also during the second quarter of 2016, the Company classified an $188,000 one-to-four family residential real estate loan
as a TDR after agreeing to a loan modification which adjusted the payment schedule. No loan modifications were classified as TDRs
during the first quarter of 2016. The Company recorded charge-offs of $215,000 and a provision for loan loss of $2,000 against
TDRs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. No loan modifications were classified as TDRs during the third
quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company classified a commercial loan relationship consisting of $2.7 million
in real estate and land loans as a TDR after agreeing to a bankruptcy plan with the borrower. The bankruptcy plan restarted the
amortization period of the loans which extended the maturities of the loans. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company classified
a $44,000 agriculture loan relationship consisting of two loans as a TDR after extending the maturity of the loans. During the
first nine months of 2016, a $56,000 one-to-four family residential real estate loan and a $25,000 agriculture loan, which were
both classified as TDRs during 2015, were paid off. During the first nine months of 2015, a land loan relationship consisting of
three loans totaling $1.6 million, which was previously classified as a TDR during 2012, was paid off with proceeds from the sale
of assets and a new loan on the remaining assets was originated at market terms. The Company did not record any charge-offs or
provision for loan losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company evaluates
each TDR individually and returns the loan to accrual status when a payment history is established after the restructuring and
future payments are reasonably assured. There were no loans modified as TDRs for which there was a payment default within 12 months
of modification as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. At September 30, 2016, there was a commitment of $84,000 to lend additional
funds on one construction and land loan classified as a TDR. The Company had no allowance recorded against loans classified as
TDRs at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. There were no loans modified as TDRs in the process of foreclosure at September
30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

The following table
presents information on loans that are classified as TDRs: 

4.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    

The Company tests goodwill
for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances warrant. The Company s annual step one impairment test as of
December 31, 2015 concluded that its goodwill was not impaired. The Company concluded there were no triggering events during the
first nine months of 2016 that required an interim goodwill impairment test. 

Lease intangible assets
are amortized over the life of the lease. Core deposit intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of ten years
on an accelerated basis. A summary of the other intangible assets that continue to be subject to amortization is as follows: 

The following sets forth estimated amortization
expense for core deposit and lease intangible assets for the remainder of 2016 and in successive years ending December 31: 

Mortgage loans serviced
for others are not reported as assets. The following table provides information on the principal balances of mortgage loans serviced
for others: 

Custodial escrow balances
maintained in connection with serviced loans were $7.2 million and $3.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Gross service fee income related to such loans was $308,000 and $285,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and is included in fees and service charges in the consolidated statements of earnings. Gross service fee income
related to such loans was $912,000 and $808,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Activity for mortgage servicing rights and
the related valuation allowance follows: 

The fair value of mortgage
servicing rights was $4.1 million and $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Fair value at September
30, 2016 was determined using discount rates ranging from 9.50% to 9.51%; prepayment speeds ranging from 5.50% to 15.09%, depending
on the stratification of the specific mortgage servicing right; and a weighted average default rate of 2.20%. Fair value at December
31, 2015 was determined using discount rates ranging from 9.50% to 10.00%; prepayment speeds ranging from 5.15% to 33.78%, depending
on the stratification of the specific mortgage servicing right; and a weighted average default rate of 2.25%. 

The Company had a mortgage
repurchase reserve of $361,000 and $351,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which represents the Company s
best estimate of probable losses that the Company will incur related to the repurchase of one-to-four family residential real estate
loans previously sold or to reimburse investors for credit losses incurred on loans previously sold where a breach of the contractual
representations and warranties occurred. The Company did not incur any losses charged against the reserve or make any provisions
to the reserve during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. The Company had no losses or recoveries during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and recovered $10,000 of losses against the mortgage repurchase reserve during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any outstanding mortgage repurchase requests. 

5.    Earnings per Share    

Basic earnings per
share have been computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings
per share include the effect of all potential common shares outstanding during each period. The shares used in the calculation
of basic and diluted earnings per share are shown below: 

(1) Share and per share values for the periods ended September
30, 2015 have been adjusted to give effect to the 5% stock dividend paid during December 2015. 

The diluted earnings
per share computations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include all unexercised stock options because
no stock options were anti-dilutive during such periods. 

6.    Repurchase Agreements    

The Company has overnight
repurchase agreements with certain deposit customers whereby the Company uses investment securities as collateral for non-insured
funds. These balances are accounted for as collateralized financing and included in other borrowings on the balance sheet. The
following is a summary of the balances of and collateral for the Company s repurchase agreements: 

Repurchase agreements
are comprised of non-insured customer funds, totaling $12.5 million at September 30, 2016, and $12.0 million at December 31, 2015,
which were secured by $16.7 million and $15.7 million of the Company s investment portfolio at the same dates, respectively. 

The investment securities
are held by a third-party financial institution in the customer s custodial account. The Company is required to maintain
adequate collateral for each repurchase agreement. Changes in the fair value of the investment securities impact the amount of
collateral required. If the Company were to default, the investment securities would be used to settle the repurchase agreement
with the deposit customer. 

7.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements    

Fair value is the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1   Quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement
date. 

Level 2   Significant other
observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3   Significant unobservable
inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability. 

Fair value estimates
of the Company s financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including methods and assumptions
utilized, are set forth below: 

Methods and Assumptions Utilized   

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
is considered to approximate fair value. 

The Company s
investment securities classified as available-for-sale include U.S. treasury securities, U.S. federal agency securities, municipal
obligations, agency mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposits and common stocks. Quoted exchange prices are available
for the Company s U.S treasury securities and common stock investments, which are classified as Level 1. U.S. federal agency
securities and agency mortgage-backed obligations are priced utilizing industry-standard models that consider various assumptions,
including time value, yield curves, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual
prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions
are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. These measurements are classified as Level 2. Municipal securities are valued using a type of
matrix, or grid, pricing in which securities are benchmarked against U.S. treasury rates based on credit rating. These model and
matrix measurements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

It is not practical
to determine the fair value of bank stocks due to restrictions placed on the transferability of FHLB and FRB stock. 

The estimated fair
value of the Company s loan portfolio is based on the segregation of loans by collateral type, interest terms, and maturities.
The fair value is estimated based on discounting scheduled and estimated cash flows through maturity using an appropriate risk-adjusted
yield curve to approximate current interest rates for each category. No adjustment was made to the interest rates for changes in
credit risk of performing loans where there are no known credit concerns. Management segregates loans in appropriate risk categories.
Management believes that the risk factor embedded in the interest rates along with the allowance for loan losses applicable to
the performing loan portfolio results in a fair valuation of such loans. The fair values of impaired loans are generally based
on market prices for similar assets determined through independent appraisals or discounted values of independent appraisals and
brokers  opinions of value. This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of fair value
prescribed by ASC Topic 820 and is classified as Level 3. 

Mortgage loans originated
and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, determined on an aggregate
basis. The mortgage loan valuations are based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans and are classified as Level 2. 

The carrying amounts of accrued interest
receivable and payable are considered to approximate fair value. 

The estimated fair
value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest-bearing demand deposits, savings, money market accounts, and checking
accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value of interest-bearing time deposits is based on the discounted
value of contractual cash flows of such deposits. The discount rate is tied to the FHLB yield curve plus an appropriate servicing
spread. Fair value measurements based on discounted cash flows are classified as Level 2. These fair values do not incorporate
the value of core deposit intangibles which may be associated with the deposit base. 

The fair value of advances
from the FHLB, subordinated debentures, and other borrowings is estimated using current yield curves for similar borrowings adjusted
for the Company s current credit spread and classified as Level 2. 

The Company s
derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sales contracts on mortgage
loans held for sale. The fair values of these derivatives are based on quoted prices for similar loans in the secondary market.
The market prices are adjusted by a factor, based on the Company s historical data and management s judgment about
future economic trends, which considers the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. These instruments
are classified as Level 2. The amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and
gains on sale of loans, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments   

The fair value of letters
of credit and commitments to extend credit is based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements. The aggregate
of these fees is not material. 

Transfers   

The Company did not
transfer any assets or liabilities among levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or during the year ended December
31, 2015. 

Valuation Methods for Instruments
Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   

The following table
represents the Company s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, allocated to the appropriate fair value hierarchy: 

Changes in the fair
value of available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income to the extent the changes are not considered
other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairment tests are performed on a quarterly basis and any decline in the
fair value of an individual security below its cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a write-down of that security s
cost basis. 

Valuation Methods for Instruments
Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis   

The Company does not
value its loan portfolio at fair value. Collateral-dependent impaired loans are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair
value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs. Collateral values are determined based on appraisals performed by qualified
licensed appraisers hired by the Company and then further adjusted if warranted based on relevant facts and circumstances. The
appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales and income approach.
Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales
and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for
determining fair value. Impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated at least quarterly for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly,
based on the same factors identified above. The carrying value of the Company s impaired loans was $6.1 million and $6.8
million, with an allocated allowance of $37,000 and $88,000, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

8.    Regulatory Capital Requirements    

Banks and bank holding
companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines
and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain
off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject
to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believed
that as of September 30, 2016, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject at that
time. 

Prompt
corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition.
If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions
are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. On January 1, 2015, the Company and
the Bank became subject to new capital rules (the  Basel III Rules ) that implemented the Basel III regulatory capital
reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act.  The Basel III Rules are applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements, as
well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than  small bank holding companies  (generally, non-public
bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1.0 billion). 

The Basel III Rules
have maintained the general structure of the prompt corrective action framework, while incorporating increased requirements.  The
Basel III Rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio of
Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%,
and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital,
is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016
at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level
of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer increases the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital and
total risk based capital ratios as of March 31 of each year until the final level of 2.5% is reached. The Bank made the one-time
accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) opt-out election on its first Call Report filed after January 1, 2015,
which allowed banks under $250 billion a one-time opt-out election to remove the impact of certain unrealized capital gains and
losses from the calculation of capital.  

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action then in effect. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management
believes have changed the institution s category. 

The following is a
comparison of the Company s regulatory capital to minimum capital requirements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

*The ratios for September 30, 2016 include a capital conservation
buffer of 0.625%.

9.    Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The main
provisions of the update require the identification of performance obligations within a contract and require the recognition of
revenue based on a stand-alone allocation of contract revenue to each performance obligation. Performance obligations may be satisfied
and revenue recognized over a period of time if: 1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by
the entity s performance as the entity performs, or 2) the entity s performance creates or enhances an asset that the
customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or 3) the entity s performance does not create an asset with an alternative
use to the entity, and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. For public entities the
amendments of the update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods
within that reporting period. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

In January 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities. The
main provisions of the update are to eliminate the available for sale classification of accounting for equity securities and to
adjust the fair value disclosures for financial instruments carried at amortized costs such that the disclosed fair values represent
an exit price as opposed to an entry price. The provisions of this update will require that equity securities be carried at fair
market value on the balance sheet and any periodic changes in value will be adjustments to the income statement. A practical expedient
is provided for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, such that these securities can be carried at cost
less any impairment. The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017. Upon the effective date of the update, changes in the value of the Company's common stock investments will be adjustments
to the income statement. Management does not expect the remaining requirements of this update to have a material impact on the
Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued an update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases creating FASB Topic 842, Leases. The guidance is intended to increase transparency
and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring more
disclosures related to leasing transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued an update ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance
in this update affects any entity that issues share-based payment awards including income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flow. The amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as  CECL.  The provisions
of the update eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold under current GAAP which requires reserves to be based on an
incurred loss methodology. Under CECL reserves required for financial assets measured at amortized cost will reflect an organization s
estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected term of the financial asset and thereby require the use of reasonable
and supportable forecasts to estimate future credit losses. Because CECL encompasses all financial assets carried at amortized
cost, the requirement that reserves be established based on an organization s reasonable and supportable estimate of expected
credit losses extends to held to maturity debt securities. Under the provisions of the update, credit losses recognized on available
for sale debt securities will be presented as an allowance as opposed to a write-down. In addition, CECL will modify the accounting
for purchased loans, with credit deterioration since origination, so that reserves are established at the date of acquisition for
purchased loans. Under current GAAP a purchased loan s contractual balance is adjusted to fair value through a credit discount
and no reserve is recorded on the purchased loan upon acquisition. Since under CECL reserves will be established for purchased
loans at the time of acquisition the accounting for purchased loans is made more comparable to the accounting for originated loans.
Finally, increased disclosure requirements under CECL oblige organizations to present the currently required credit quality disclosures
disaggregated by the year of origination or vintage. FASB expects that the evaluation of underwriting standards and credit quality
trends by financial statement users will be enhanced with the additional vintage disclosures. For public entities the amendments
of the update are effective beginning January 1, 2020. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of CECL on the Company s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as its required disclosures. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments (a consensus
of Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU attempts to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified
in the statement of cash flows. The purpose of this update is to reduce existing diversity in practice in eight areas addressed
by the update. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management has concluded that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will not have a
material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Overview .
  Landmark Bancorp, Inc. is a one-bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is engaged
in the banking business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Landmark National Bank. Except as otherwise required by the context,
references to the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer collectively to Landmark
Bancorp, Inc. and Landmark National Bank The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol  LARK. 
The Bank is dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services to its local communities. Our strategy includes continuing
a tradition of holding quality assets while growing our commercial, commercial real estate and agriculture loan portfolios. We
are committed to developing relationships with our borrowers and providing a total banking service. 

The Bank is principally
engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits, together with borrowings and other
funds, to originate one-to-four family residential real estate, construction and land, commercial real estate, commercial, agriculture,
municipal and consumer loans. Although not our primary business function, we do invest in certain investment and mortgage-related
securities using deposits and other borrowings as funding sources. 

Our results of operations
depend generally on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets and interest
expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that
influence interest rates, loan demand and deposit flows. In addition, we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that
our interest-earning assets mature or reprice at different times, or at different speeds, than our interest-bearing liabilities.
Our results of operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges, loan fees and gains from the sale
of newly originated loans, gains or losses on investments and certain other non-interest related items. Our principal operating
expenses, aside from interest expense, consist of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, federal
deposit insurance costs, data processing expenses, provision for loan losses and certain other non-interest related expenses. 

We are significantly
impacted by prevailing economic conditions including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulations of financial
institutions. Deposit balances are influenced by numerous factors such as competing investments, the level of income and the personal
rate of savings within our market areas. Factors influencing lending activities include the demand for housing and the interest
rate pricing competition from other lending institutions. 

Currently, our business
consists of ownership of the Bank, with its main office in Manhattan, Kansas and twenty-eight additional branch offices in central,
eastern, southeast and southwest Kansas. 

Critical
Accounting Policies   .  Critical accounting policies are those which are both most important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Our critical
accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of investment securities, accounting for income taxes
and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which involve significant judgment by our management.  Information
about our critical accounting policies is included under Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Summary
of Results .  During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded net earnings of $2.1 million, which was a decrease of $435,000
from the $2.5 million of net earnings in the third quarter of 2015.  The decrease in net earnings during the third quarter
was primarily the result of an $794,000 decline in gains on sales of loans. Our gains on sales of loans declined during the third
quarter of 2016 as a result of the loss of several mortgage lenders during the second quarter of 2016. 

During
the first nine months of 2016, we recorded net earnings of $6.6 million, which was a decrease of $1.3 million from the $7.9 million
of net earnings in the first nine months of 2015.  The decrease in net earnings was partially the result of a $1.7 million
recovery on a previously charged-off construction loan, which contributed to a $700,000 credit to the provision for loan losses
during the first nine months of 2015 compared to  a $500,000 provision
for loan losses during the same period of 2016. In addition, gains on sales of loans declined $1.8 million during the first nine
months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 due to the loss of several mortgage lenders.  

The following table
summarizes earnings and key performance measures for the periods presented. 

(2)  Ratios have been
                                         annualized and are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. 

(3)  Net interest margin
                                         is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis, using a 34% federal tax rate. 

Interest Income.
  Interest income of $7.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $150,000, or 2.1%, as compared to the
same period of 2015. Interest income on loans increased $135,000, or 2.6%, to $5.4 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due to an increase in our average loan balances from $427.0 million during
the third quarter of 2015 to $437.1 million during the third quarter of 2016 and to higher tax equivalent yields earned on loans,
which increased from 4.92% to 4.94% between the same periods. Interest income on investment securities increased $15,000, or 0.80%,
to $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $1.9 million in the same period of 2015. The increase in interest
income on investment securities was primarily the result of an increase in our average balance of investment securities from $357.2
million during the third quarter of 2015 to $370.7 million during the third quarter of 2016. Partially offsetting the higher average
balances of investment securities was a decrease in our tax equivalent yield, which decreased from 2.62% in the third quarter
of 2015 to 2.56% during the third quarter of 2016. 

Interest income of
$21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $240,000, or 1.1%, as compared to the same period of 2015.
Interest income on loans decreased $17,000, or 0.1%, to $15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
same period of 2015, due to lower tax equivalent yields earned on loans, which decreased to 4.94% from 5.01% over the same periods.
Partially offsetting the lower yields was an increase in our average loan balances from $428.6 million during the first nine months
of 2015 to $433.8 million during the first nine months of 2016. Interest income on investment securities increased $257,000, or
4.5%, to $6.0 million for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $5.7 million in the same period of 2015. The increase
in interest income on investment securities was primarily the result of an increase in our average balance of investment securities
from $353.5 million during the nine months of 2015 to $368.6 million during the first nine months of 2016. Also contributing to
the higher interest income on investment securities was an increase in our tax equivalent yield, which increased from 2.58% in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to 2.61% during the same period of 2016. 

Interest
Expense .  Interest expense during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $25,000, or 3.2%, to $798,000 as compared
to the same period of 2015.  Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased $20,000, or 7.5%, to $285,000 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Our total cost of interest-bearing deposits
increased from 0.19% during the third quarter of 2015 to 0.20% during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of higher rates on
our money market and checking accounts as short-term interest rates were higher during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to
the same period of 2015. Our average interest-bearing deposit balances increased from $550.9 million to $560.0 million from the
third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016. For the third quarter of 2016, interest expense on borrowings increased $5,000,
or 1.0%, to $513,000 as compared to the same period of 2015, due to higher average rates on our borrowings, which increased from
2.49% to 2.72% between the same periods as our variable rate borrowings repriced higher due to an increase in short-term interest
rates. Partially offsetting the higher rates on borrowings was a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings, which decreased
from $80.8 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $75.3 million during the same period of 2016. 

Interest
expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $67,000, or 2.9%, to $2.4 million as compared to the same period
of 2015.  Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased $34,000, or 4.2%, to $849,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. Our total cost of interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.19% during
the first nine months of 2015 to 0.20% during the same period of 2016 as a result of higher rates on our money market and checking
accounts. Partially offsetting the higher costs was a decrease in average interest-bearing deposit balances, which decreased slightly
from $561.4 million during the first nine months of 2015 to $561.3 million during the first nine months of 2016. For the first
nine months of 2016, interest expense on borrowings increased $33,000, or 2.2%, to $1.5 million as compared to the same period
of 2015, due to an increase in our average outstanding borrowings. Our average outstanding borrowings increased from $76.6 million
in the first nine months of 2015 to $78.8 million during the same period of 2016. Partially offsetting the increase in average
outstanding borrowings was a lower average rate on our borrowings, which decreased from 2.61% in the first nine month of 2015
to 2.60% in same period of 2016 as we maintained higher average balances on our lower cost lines of credit. 

Net Interest
Income .  Net interest income was $6.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $125,000, or 1.9%,
from the third quarter of 2015. Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased from 3.48% in the third quarter of 2015
to 3.45% in the same period of 2016. The increase in net interest income resulted from a 3.1% increase in average interest-earning
assets, from $784.6 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $809.9 million in the third quarter of 2016. The lower net interest
margin was a result of a combination of lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher rates on interest-bearing deposits
and borrowings. 

Net interest income
was $19.5 million for the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $173,000, or 0.9%, from the same period of 2015. Net interest
margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased from 3.50% in the first nine months of 2015 to 3.46% in the first nine months of
2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of a 2.5% increase in average interest-earning assets from
$785.7 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $805.7 million in the first nine months of 2016, while the lower net interest
margin was a result of lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher rates on interest-bearing deposits. 

Average Assets/Liabilities .
 The following tables reflect the tax-equivalent yields earned on average interest-earning assets and costs of average interest-bearing
liabilities for the periods indicated (derived by dividing income or expense by the monthly average balance of assets or liabilities,
respectively) as well as  net interest margin  (which reflects the effect of the net earnings balance) for the periods
shown: 

(1)  Income on tax exempt securities is presented on a fully tax-equivalent
                                         basis, using a 34% federal tax rate.   

(2)  Includes loans classified as non-accrual. Income on tax-exempt
                                         loans is presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis, using a 34% federal tax rate.   

(3)  Interest rate spread represents the difference between the
                                         average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing
                                         liabilities.   

(4)  Net interest margin represents annualized, tax-equivalent
                                         net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.   

(1)  Income on tax exempt securities is presented on a fully tax-equivalent
                                         basis, using a 34% federal tax rate.   

(2)  Includes loans classified as non-accrual. Income on tax-exempt
                                         loans is presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis, using a 34% federal tax rate.   

(3)  Interest rate spread represents the difference between the
                                         average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing
                                         liabilities.   

(4)  Net interest margin represents annualized, tax-equivalent
                                         net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.   

Rate/Volume
Table   .  The following table describes the extent to which changes in volumes and rates of tax-equivalent interest
income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities affected the Company s
interest income and expense for the periods indicated. The table distinguishes between (i) changes attributable to rate (changes
in rate multiplied by prior volume), (ii) changes attributable to volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), and (iii)
net change (the sum of the previous columns). The net changes attributable to the combined effect of volume and rate that cannot
be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 

Provision
for Loan Losses .   We maintain, and our Board of Directors monitors, an allowance for losses on loans. The allowance
is established based upon management's periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, review of significant
individual loans and collateral, review of delinquent loans, past loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers 
ability to repay, current and expected market conditions, and other factors management deems important. Determining the appropriate
level of reserves involves a high degree of management judgment and is based upon historical and projected losses in the loan
portfolio and the collateral value or discounted cash flows of specifically identified impaired loans. Additionally, allowance
policies are subject to periodic review and revision in response to a number of factors, including current market conditions,
actual loss experience and management s expectations. 

During the third quarter
of 2016, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $150,000 compared to $100,000 in the third quarter of 2015. We recorded net
loan charge-offs of $295,000 during the third quarter of 2016 compared to net loan charge-offs of $182,000 during the third quarter
of 2015. The net loan charge-offs during the third quarter of 2016 were primarily related to the restructuring of a previously
identified and impaired agriculture loan relationship. 

During
the first nine months of 2016, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $500,000 compared to a credit provision for loan losses
of $700,000 during the same period of 2015. We recorded net loan charge-offs of $915,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to net loan recoveries of $1.3 million during the same period of 2015. The net loan charge-offs during the first
nine months of 2016 were primarily related to restructuring an agriculture loan relationship and the liquidation of the assets
securing a previously identified and impaired commercial loan. The net loan recoveries during the first nine months of 2015 were
primarily associated with the recovery of $1.7 million on a $4.3 million construction loan which was fully charged-off during
2010 and 2011.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recovered approximately $2.4 million of the loan and continues
to pursue collection of the remaining amount.  The net loan recoveries
in the first nine months of 2015 were the primary reason for the negative provision for loan losses during the period.  

For further discussion
of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the  Asset Quality and Distribution  section below. 

Non-interest
Income .  Total non-interest income was $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $734,000, or 16.4%, compared
to $4.5 million in the same period of 2015. This change was primarily the result of a $794,000 decline in gains on sales of loans,
as the departure of several mortgage lenders affected originations in the third quarter of 2016. Partially offsetting the lower
gains on sales of loans were $261,000 of gains on sales of investment securities, relating primarily to the sale of common stock
investments securities. A net gain of $135,000 was recorded on sales of investment securities during the third quarter of 2015
as we sold a portion of our agency mortgage-backed investment securities portfolio to reduce exposure to rising interest rates. 

Total non-interest
income was $11.6 million in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 10.4%, compared to $12.9 million during
the same period of 2015. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a $1.8 million decline in gains on sales of
loans, which resulted from fewer mortgage lenders on staff, and a $271,000 decline in other non-interest income. Included in other
non-interest income during the first nine months of 2015 was a gain of $236,000 on the sale of a closed branch facility. Partially
offsetting those reductions were $558,000 of gains on sales of $14.3 million of municipal bonds and common stock investment securities
that were identified for sale as part of the ongoing review of the portfolio, during the first nine months of 2016. During the
first nine months of 2015, a loss of $119,000 on sales of investment securities was incurred due primarily to the sale of a portion
of our agency mortgage-backed investment securities portfolio to reduce exposure to rising interest rates. 

Non-interest
Expense .  Non-interest expense increased $86,000, or 1.2%, to $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $7.3
million for the third quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of increases of $58,000 in occupancy and equipment and $50,000 in
foreclosure and real estate owned expense. The increase in occupancy and equipment reflects higher levels of building repairs
while new real estate owned properties increased foreclosure and real estate owned expenses. Partially offsetting those increases
were declines of $74,000 in other non-interest expense and $22,000 in federal deposit insurance premiums. The decrease in non-interest
expense reflected the reduced mortgage banking activity while the decline in federal deposit insurance premiums was the result
of new assessment rates that took effect in the third quarter 2016. 

Non-interest expense
decreased $95,000, or 0.4%, to $21.8 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $21.9 million for the first nine months
of 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a $361,000 decrease in other non-interest expense, reflecting a $163,000 impairment
of the residual real estate collateral associated with an affordable housing investment that was recorded in 2015, as well as
reduced mortgage banking activity during in the first nine months of 2016. Those decreases were partially offset by increases
of $121,000 in foreclosure and other real estate expense and $65,000 in advertising expenses. The increase in foreclosure and
real estate owned expense was primarily related to real estate owned properties added during the first nine months of 2016 while
the increase in advertising expenses reflected costs associated with growth in our deposit rewards program. 

Income Tax Expense .
 During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $656,000, compared to $966,000 during the same period
of 2015. The effective tax rate decreased from 27.6% in the third quarter of 2015 to 23.9% in the third quarter of 2016 as a result
of a decline in earnings before income taxes and higher tax exempt income. 

During the first nine
months of 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $2.2 million, compared to $3.2 million during the same period of 2015. The effective
tax rate decreased from 28.7% in the first nine months of 2015 to 25.1% in the same period of 2016 as a result of a decline in
earnings before income taxes and higher tax exempt income. 

Financial Condition  .
Despite measured improvement in certain metrics, general uncertainty with respect to economic conditions in the United States
continues to affect our asset quality and performance. These economic conditions, as well as a downturn in the agriculture sector,
have impacted the geographic markets in which the Company operates. Our loan portfolio is diversified across various types of
loans and collateral throughout the markets in which we operate. Despite a few problem loans that management continues to work
to resolve, our asset quality has generally improved over the past few years. Outside of identified problem assets, management
believes that the Company continues to have a high quality asset base and solid core earnings, and anticipates that its efforts
to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue to create a strong foundation for continued
growth and profitability in the future. 

Asset Quality
and Distribution .  Our primary investing activities are the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate,
construction and land, commercial real estate, commercial, agriculture, municipal and consumer loans and the purchase of investment
securities. Total assets increased to $907.7 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $878.4 million at December 31, 2015. The
increase in our total assets was primarily the result of increases in our investment securities and loans. Investment securities
increased from $353.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $374.4 million at September 30, 2016 as a result of the purchase of additional
investment securities during the first nine months of 2016. Loans increased from $419.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $430.0
million at September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of increases in our agriculture loans. 

The allowance for
loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio
and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activity. This evaluation, which includes a review of all loans with respect
to which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions,
historical loan loss experience, level of classified loans and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate
allowance for loan losses. At September 30, 2016, our allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million, or 1.26% of gross loans
outstanding, as compared to $5.9 million, or 1.39% of gross loans outstanding, at December 31, 2015. 

The decline in our
allowance for loan losses during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily related to the allowance for loan losses required
on our one-to-four family residential real estate loans. The decline in our allowance for one-to-four family residential real
estate loans resulted from lower historical loss rates and a decrease in the adjustments for qualitative and environmental factors. 

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $20.5 million and $15.3 million, respectively, of loans were assigned a risk rating
of special mention, substandard or doubtful. The increase in these loans was primarily the result of downgrades of a few agriculture,
commercial and commercial real estate loan relationships. These ratings indicate that the loans identified as potential problem
loans have more than normal risk which raised doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms.
Even though the borrowers of such loans were experiencing moderate cash flow problems as well as some deterioration in collateral
value, management believed the general allowance was sufficient to cover the risks and probable incurred losses related to such
loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Loans past due 30-89
days and still accruing interest totaled $1.2 million, or 0.29% of gross loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 million,
or 0.33% of gross loans, at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, $1.8 million in loans were on non-accrual status, or 0.41%
of gross loans, compared to $2.2 million, or 0.51% of gross loans, at December 31, 2015. Non-accrual loans consist of loans 90
or more days past due and certain impaired loans. No loans were 90 or more days delinquent and accruing interest at September
30, 2016 or at December 31, 2015. Our impaired loans totaled $6.1 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $6.8 million at December
31, 2015. The difference in the Company s non-accrual loan balances and impaired loan balances at September 30, 2016 was
related to TDRs that were accruing interest but still classified as impaired. 

At September 30, 2016,
the Company had eleven loan relationships consisting of seventeen outstanding loans that were classified as TDRs. During the third
quarter of 2016, the Company classified a $302,000 agriculture loan relationship consisting of three loans as a TDR after extending
the maturities of the loans. The collateral securing the loans was deemed to be insufficient, resulting in a charge-off of $215,000.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company classified an $8,000 commercial loan as a TDR after modifying the payments to interest
only. Also during the second quarter of 2016, the Company classified an $188,000 one-to-four family residential real estate loan
as a TDR after agreeing to a loan modification which adjusted the payment schedule. No loan modifications were classified as TDRs
during the first quarter of2016. The Company recorded charge-offs of $215,000 and a provision for loan loss of $2,000 against
TDRs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. No loan modifications were classified as TDRs during the third
quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company classified a commercial loan relationship consisting of $2.7 million
in real estate and land loans as a TDR after agreeing to a bankruptcy plan with the borrower. The bankruptcy plan restarted the
amortization period of the loans which extended the maturities of the loans. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company classified
a $44,000 agriculture loan relationship consisting of two loans as a TDR after extending the maturity of the loans. During the
first nine months of 2016, a $56,000 one-to-four family residential real estate loan and a $25,000 agriculture loan, which were
both classified as TDRs during 2015, were paid off. During the first nine months of 2015, a land loan relationship consisting
of three loans totaling $1.6 million, which was previously classified as a TDR during 2012, was paid off with proceeds from the
sale of assets and a new loan on the remaining assets originated at market terms. The Company did not record any charge-offs or
provision for loan losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

As part of our credit
risk management, we continue to manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and have placed additional emphasis on commercial
real estate and construction and land relationships. We are working to resolve the remaining problem credits or move the non-performing
credits out of the loan portfolio. 

Liability
Distribution .   Our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits, FHLB borrowings, proceeds from principal and interest
payments on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities. While maturities
and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced
by general interest rates and economic conditions. We experienced an increase of $984,000 in total deposits during the first nine
months of 2016, to $715.7 million at September 30, 2016, from $714.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was
primarily due to higher balances in non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings accounts and certificates of deposits. Money
market and checking account balances decreased by $23.8 million between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, due primarily
to a seasonal decline in public fund balances. Total borrowings increased $15.8 million to $86.5 million at September 30, 2016,
from $70.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in borrowings was used to fund the purchase of investment securities and
to fund loan growth. 

Non-interest-bearing
demand deposits at September 30, 2016, were $159.4 million, or 22.3% of total deposits, compared to $143.6 million, or 20.1% of
total deposits, at December 31, 2015. Money market and checking deposit accounts were 45.0% of our deposit portfolio and totaled
$322.3 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $346.1 million, or 48.4% of total deposits, at December 31, 2015. Savings accounts
increased to $87.7 million, or 12.3% of total deposits, at September 30, 2016, from $81.1 million, or 11.3% of total deposits,
at December 31, 2015. Certificates of deposit totaled $146.3 million, or 20.4% of total deposits, at September 30, 2016, compared
to $143.9 million, or 20.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2015. 

Certificates of deposit
at September 30, 2016, scheduled to mature in one year or less, totaled $106.1 million. Historically, maturing deposits have generally
remained with the Bank, and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain with
us upon maturity in some type of deposit account. 

Cash Flows.
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.1 million. Our operating
activities provided cash of $14.9 million during the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in loans held for
sale as more one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were sold than originated for sale during the first nine months of
2016. Our investing activities used net cash of $27.2 million during the first nine months of 2016, primarily as a result of funding
loans and purchasing more investment securities than were sold or matured over the same time period. Financing activities provided
net cash of $16.4 million during the first nine months of 2016, primarily as a result of increased borrowings which were used
to fund the investment purchases and loan growth. 

Liquidity .
  Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale. The levels of these assets
are dependent on the operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given year. These liquid assets totaled
$392.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $367.0 million at December 31, 2015. During periods in which we are not able to originate
a sufficient amount of loans and/or periods of high principal prepayments, we generally invest in short-term, high-grade investments. 

Liquidity
management is both a daily and long-term function of our strategy. Excess funds are generally invested in short-term investments.
Excess funds are typically generated as a result of increased deposit balances, while uses of excess funds are generally deposit
withdrawals and loan advances. In the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, additional funds
are generally available through the use of FHLB advances, a line of credit with the FHLB, other borrowings or through sales of
investment securities. At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding FHLB advances of $35.0 million and $17.7 million borrowed against
our line of credit with the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, we had collateral pledged to the FHLB that would allow us to borrow an
additional $36.6 million, subject to FHLB credit requirements and policies. At September 30, 2016, we had no borrowings through
the Federal Reserve discount window, while our borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was $17.0 million. We also have various
other federal funds agreements, both secured and unsecured, with correspondent banks totaling approximately $30.0 million in available
credit under which we had no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016.  At September 
30, 2016 , we had subordinated debentures totaling $21.2 million and other borrowings of $12.5 million, which consisted
of repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no borrowings against a $7.5 million line of credit from an unrelated
financial institution maturing on November 1, 2017, with an interest rate that adjusts daily based on the prime rate less 0.25%
This line of credit has covenants specific to capital and other financial ratios, with which the Company was in compliance at
September 30, 2016. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements.    As a provider of financial services, we routinely issue financial guarantees in the
form of financial and performance standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us
generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party. While these standby letters of credit
represent a potential outlay by us, a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We have recourse
against the customer for any amount the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit. The letters
of credit are subject to the same credit policies, underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us. Most of the
standby letters of credit are secured, and in the event of nonperformance by the customers, we have the right to the underlying
collateral, which could include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable
securities. The contract amount of these standby letters of credit, which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed
by us, was $1.9 million at September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016,
we had outstanding loan commitments, excluding standby letters of credit, of $72.7 million. We anticipate that sufficient funds
will be available to meet current loan commitments. These commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance
real estate loans. 

Capital .
 Current regulatory capital regulations require financial institutions (including banks and bank holding companies) to meet
certain regulatory capital requirements. On January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to the Basel III Rules that
implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required
by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Ac t. The Basel III Rules are applicable to all U.S. banks
that are subject to minimum capital requirements, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than  small
bank holding companies  (generally, non-public bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1.0 billion). 

The Basel III Rules
have maintained the general structure of the prompt corrective action framework, while incorporating increased requirements.  The
Basel III Rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio
of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets
of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1
capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began on January
1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final
level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The Bank made the one-time AOCI opt-out election on its first Call Report filed after January
1, 2015, which allowed banks under $250 billion a one-time opt-out election to remove the impact of certain unrealized capital
gains and losses from the calculation of capital. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank was rated  well
capitalized,  which is the highest rating available under the regulatory capital regulations framework for prompt corrective
action. Management believed that as of September 30, 2016, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which
we are subject.  

Dividends  .
During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to our stockholders. 

The
payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital
pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations.  In addition, under the Basel III Rules, by January
1, 2019, financial institutions will have to maintain 2.5% in common equity Tier 1 capital attributable to the capital conservation
buffer in order to pay dividends and make other capital distributions. This buffer is being phased in by 0.625% per year over
three years beginning in 2016 before reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  As
described above, the Bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of September 30, 2016. The
National Bank Act imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that a national bank may pay without prior regulatory approval.
Generally, the amount is limited to the bank's current year's net earnings plus the adjusted retained earnings for the two preceding
years. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $21.2 million was available to be paid as dividends to the Company by the Bank
without prior regulatory approval.  

Additionally, our
ability to pay dividends is limited by the subordinated debentures that are held by three business trusts that we control. Interest
payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. We have the
right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if we elect to defer interest payments,
all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

Our assets and liabilities
are principally financial in nature, and the resulting net interest income thereon is subject to changes in market interest rates
and the mix of various assets and liabilities. Interest rates in the financial markets affect our decisions relating to pricing
our assets and liabilities, which impact net interest income, a significant cash flow source for us. As a result, a substantial
portion of our risk management activities relates to managing interest rate risk. 

Our Asset/Liability
Management Committee monitors the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet using earnings simulation models. We have set
policy limits of interest rate risk to be assumed in the normal course of business and monitor such limits through our simulation
process. 

We have been successful
in meeting the interest rate sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy. Simulation models are prepared to determine the impact
on net interest income for the coming twelve months, including one using rates at September 30, 2016, and forecasting volumes
for the twelve-month projection. This position is then subjected to a shift in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points with
an impact to our net interest income on a one-year   horizon as follows: 

The 200 basis point
falling scenario is considered to be not meaningful ( NM ) in the current low interest rate environment.

properties, income, or profits. Provided however, Borrower will not be required to pay and discharge any such assessment, tax,
charge, levy, lien or claim so long as (1) the legality of the same shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings,
and (2) Borrower shall have established on Borrower's books adequate reserves with respect to such contested assessment, tax,
charge, levy, lien, or claim in accordance with GAAP.

including without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act. Borrower may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance,
or regulation and withhold compliance during any proceeding, including appropriate appeals, so long as Borrower has notified Lender

Lender may require Borrower to post adequate security or a surety bond, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, to protect Lender's
interest.

or agents of Lender at any reasonable time to inspect any and all Collateral for the Loan or Loans and Borrower's other properties

and records. If Borrower now or at any time hereafter maintains any records (including without limitation computer generated records
and computer software programs for the generation of such records) in the possession of a third party, Borrower, upon request
of Lender, shall notify such party to permit Lender free access to such records at all reasonable times and to provide Lender

liability, in compliance with all applicable requirements of law and regulations. 

Environmental Compliance

result of an intentional or unintentional action or omission on Borrower's part or on the part of any third party, on property

activity is pursuant to and in compliance with the conditions of a permit issued by the appropriate federal, state or local governmental
authorities; shall furnish to Lender promptly and in any event within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof a copy of any notice,
summons, lien, citation, directive, letter or other communication from any governmental agency or instrumentality concerning any

statements, instruments, documents and other agreements as Lender or its attorneys may reasonably request to evidence and secure
the Loans and to perfect all Security Interests. 

LENDER'S EXPENDITURES.  If any action
or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Collateral or if Borrower fails to comply with
any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Borrower's failure to discharge or pay
when due any amounts Borrower is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Borrower's
behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging
or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on any Collateral
and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving any Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender
for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date
of repayment by Borrower. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will (A) be payable
on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become
due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as
a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity. 

NEGATIVE COVENANTS.  Borrower covenants
and agrees with Lender that while this Agreement is in effect, Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender: 

Indebtedness and Liens. 
(1) Except for trade debt incurred in the normal course of business and indebtedness to Lender contemplated by this Agreement,
create, incur or assume indebtedness for borrowed money, including capital leases, (2) sell, transfer, mortgage, assign, pledge,
lease, grant a security interest in, or encumber any of Borrower's assets (except as allowed as Permitted Liens), or (3) sell
with recourse any of Borrower's accounts, except to Lender. 

Continuity of
Operations.  (1) Engage in any business activities substantially different than those in which Borrower is presently
engaged, (2) cease operations, liquidate, merge, transfer, acquire or consolidate with any other entity, change its name,
dissolve or transfer or sell Collateral out of the ordinary course of business, or (3) pay any dividends on Borrower's stock
(other than dividends payable in its stock), provided, however that notwithstanding the foregoing, but only so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends, if Borrower is a
 Subchapter S Corporation  (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), Borrower may pay cash
dividends on its stock to its shareholders from time to time in amounts necessary to enable the shareholders to pay income
taxes and make estimated income tax payments to satisfy their liabilities under federal and state law which arise solely from
their status as Shareholders of a Subchapter S Corporation because of their ownership of shares of Borrower's stock, or
purchase or retire any of Borrower's outstanding shares or alter or amend Borrower's capital structure. 

Loans, Acquisitions and Guaranties.
 (1) Loan, invest in or advance money or assets to any other person, enterprise or entity, (2) purchase, create or acquire
any interest in any other enterprise or entity, or (3) incur any obligation as surety or guarantor other than in the ordinary
course of business. 

Agreements.  Enter into
any agreement containing any provisions which would be violated or breached by the performance of Borrower's obligations under
this Agreement or in connection herewith. 

CESSATION OF ADVANCES . If Lender
has made any commitment to make any Loan to Borrower, whether under this Agreement or under any other agreement, Lender shall
have no obligation to make Loan Advances or to disburse Loan proceeds if: (A) Borrower or any Guarantor is in default under the
terms of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents or any other agreement that Borrower or any Guarantor has with Lender;
(B) Borrower or any Guarantor dies, becomes incompetent or becomes insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
or is adjudged a bankrupt; (C) there occurs a material adverse change in Borrower's financial condition, in the financial condition
of any Guarantor, or in the value of any Collateral securing any Loan; or (D) any Guarantor seeks, claims or otherwise attempts
to limit, modify or revoke such Guarantor's guaranty of the Loan or any other loan with Lender; or (E) Lender in good faith deems
itself insecure, even though no Event of Default shall have occurred. 

RIGHT OF SETOFF.  To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Borrower's accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings,
or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open
in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would be prohibited
by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the Indebtedness
against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender's option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow Lender to protect
Lender's charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph.

shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment Default.  Borrower
fails to make any payment when due under the Loan.

fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of
the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement
between Lender and Borrower. 

Default in Favor of Third
Parties.  Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement,
or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower's or any Grantor's
property or Borrower's or any Grantor's ability to repay the Loans or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement
or any of the Related Documents. 

False Statements.  Any
warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower's behalf, or made by Guarantor, under
this Agreement or the Related Documents in connection with the obtaining of the Loan evidenced by the Note or any security document
directly or indirectly securing repayment of the Note is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time
made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Insolvency . The dissolution
or termination of Borrower's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any
part of Borrower's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of
any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower. 

Defective Collateralization.
 This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral
document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.
 Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other
method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Loan. This includes a garnishment
of any of Borrower's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there
is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture
proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies
or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being
an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Execution; Attachment. 
Any execution or attachment is levied against the Collateral, and such execution or attachment is not set aside, discharged or
stayed within thirty (30) days after the same is levied. 

Change in Zoning or Public
Restriction.  Any change in any zoning ordinance or regulation or any other public restriction is enacted, adopted or implemented,
that limits or defines the uses which may be made of the Collateral such that the present or intended use of the Collateral, as
specified in the Related Documents, would be in violation of such zoning ordinance or regulation or public restriction, as changed. 

Default Under Other Lien
Documents.  A default occurs under any other mortgage, deed of trust or security agreement covering all or any portion of the
Collateral. 

Judgment.  Unless adequately
covered by insurance in the opinion of Lender, the entry of a final judgment for the payment of money involving more than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) against Borrower and the failure by Borrower to discharge the same, or cause it to be discharged,
or bonded off to Lender's satisfaction, within thirty (30) days from the date of the order, decree or process under which or pursuant
to which such judgment was entered. 

Events Affecting Guarantor .

Any change in ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the common stock of Borrower. 

Adverse Change . A material
adverse change occurs in Borrower's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Loan
is impaired. 

Insecurity . Lender in
good faith believes itself insecure. 

EFFECT OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. 
If any Event of Default shall occur, except where otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Related Documents, all commitments
and obligations of Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents or any other agreement immediately will terminate (including
any obligation to make further Loan Advances or disbursements), and, at Lender's option, all Indebtedness immediately will become
due and payable, all without notice of any kind to Borrower, except that in the case of an Event of Default of the type described
in the  Insolvency  subsection above, such acceleration shall be automatic and not optional. In addition, Lender shall
have all the rights and remedies provided in the Related Documents or available at law, in equity, or otherwise. Except as may
be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.
Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or
to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower or of any Grantor shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and
to exercise its rights and remedies. 

ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS.  Borrower
shall provide Lender with the following additional documents: 

Corporate Resolution .
Borrower has provided or will provide Lender with a certified copy of resolutions properly adopted by Borrower's Board of Directors,
and certified by Borrower's corporate secretary, assistant secretary, or other authorized officer, under which Borrower's Board
of Directors authorized one or more designated officers or employees to execute this Agreement, the Note and any and all Security
Agreements directly or indirectly securing repayment of the same, and to consummate the borrowings and other transactions as contemplated
under this Agreement, and to consent to the remedies following any default by Borrower as provided in this Agreement and in any
Security Agreements.

image or facsimile) shall in all respects be considered equivalent to an original, and Borrower hereby waives any rights or objections
to the use of such copies. 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  The following
miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement: 

Amendments.  This Agreement,

and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings
(including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection

Agreement. 

Consent to Loan Participation.
 Borrower agrees and consents to Lender's sale or transfer, whether now or later, of one or more participation interests in
the Loan to one or more purchasers, whether related or unrelated to Lender. Lender may provide, without any limitation whatsoever,
to any one or more purchasers, or potential purchasers, any information or knowledge Lender may have about Borrower or about any
other matter relating to the Loan, and Borrower hereby waives any rights to privacy Borrower may have with respect to such matters.
Borrower additionally waives any and all notices of sale of participation interests, as well as all notices of any repurchase
of such participation interests. Borrower also agrees that the purchasers of any such participation interests will be considered
as the absolute owners of such interests in the Loan and will have all the rights granted under the participation agreement or
agreements governing the sale of such participation interests. Borrower further waives all rights of offset or counterclaim that
it may have now or later against Lender or against any purchaser of such a participation interest and unconditionally agrees that
either Lender or such purchaser may enforce Borrower's obligation under the Loan irrespective of the failure or insolvency of
any holder of any interest in the Loan. Borrower further agrees that the purchaser of any such participation interests may enforce
its interests irrespective of any personal claims or defenses that Borrower may have against Lender. 

Governing Law. This Agreement
will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of
Nebraska without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of Nebraska.  

Choice of Venue.  If there
is a lawsuit, Borrower agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Douglas County, State of Nebraska. 

Non-Liability of Lender.
 The relationship between Borrower and Lender created by this Agreement is strictly a debtor and creditor relationship and
not fiduciary in nature, nor is the relationship to be construed as creating any partnership or joint venture between Lender and
Borrower. Borrower is exercising Borrower's own judgment with respect to Borrower's business. All information supplied to Lender
is for Lender's protection only and no other party is entitled to rely on such information. There is no duty for Lender to review,
inspect, supervise or inform Borrower of any matter with respect to Borrower's business. Lender and Borrower intend that Lender
may reasonably rely on all information supplied by Borrower to Lender, together with all representations and warranties given
by Borrower to Lender, without investigation or confirmation by Lender and that any investigation or failure to investigate will
not diminish Lender's right to so rely. 

Notice of Lender's Breach.
 Borrower must notify Lender in writing of any breach of this Agreement or the Related Documents by Lender and any other claim,
cause of action or offset against Lender within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such breach or after the accrual of such
claim, cause of action or offset. Borrower waives any claim, cause of action or offset for which notice is not given in accordance
with this paragraph. Lender is entitled to rely on any failure to give such notice. 

Indemnification of Lender.
 Borrower agrees to indemnify, to defend and to save and hold Lender harmless from any and all claims, suits, obligations,
damages, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, Lender's attorneys' fees), demands, liabilities, penalties,
fines and forfeitures of any nature whatsoever that may be asserted against or incurred by Lender, its officers, directors, employees,
and agents arising out of, relating to, or in any manner occasioned by this Agreement and the exercise of the rights and remedies
granted Lender under this, as well as by: (1) the ownership, use, operation, construction, renovation, demolition, preservation,
management, repair, condition, or maintenance of any part of the Collateral; (2) the exercise of any of Borrower's rights collaterally
assigned and pledged to Lender hereunder; (3) any failure of Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder; and/or (4)
any failure of Borrower to comply with the environmental and ERISA obligations, representations and warranties set forth herein.
The foregoing indemnity provisions shall survive the cancellation of this Agreement as to all matters arising or accruing prior
to such cancellation and the foregoing indemnity shall survive in the event that Lender elects to exercise any of the remedies
as provided under this Agreement following default hereunder. Borrower's indemnity obligations under this section shall not in
any way be affected by the presence or absence of covering insurance, or by the amount of such insurance or by the failure or
refusal of any insurance carrier to perform any obligation on its part under any insurance policy or policies affecting the Collateral
and/or Borrower's business activities. Should any claim, action or proceeding be made or brought against Lender by reason of any
event as to which Borrower's indemnification obligations apply, then, upon Lender's demand, Borrower, at its sole cost and expense,
shall defend such claim, action or proceeding in Borrower's name, if necessary, by the attorneys for Borrower's insurance carrier
(if such claim, action or proceeding is covered by insurance), or otherwise by such attorneys as Lender shall approve. Lender
may also engage its own attorneys at its reasonable discretion to defend Borrower and to assist in its defense and Borrower agrees
to pay the fees and disbursements of such attorneys. 

Counterparts.  This Agreement
may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts,
taken together, shall constitute one and the same Agreement. 

No Waiver by Lender. 
Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by
Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other
right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender's right otherwise
to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course
of dealing between Lender and Borrower, or between Lender and any Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender's rights
or of any of Borrower's or any Grantor's obligations as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required
under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent
instances where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender. 

Notices.  Any notice required
to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when actually received
by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier, or, if mailed,
when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the addresses
shown near the beginning of this Agreement. Any party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving formal
written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party's address. For notice purposes,
Borrower agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Borrower's current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law,
if there is more than one Borrower, any notice given by Lender to any Borrower is deemed to be notice given to all Borrowers. 

Severability.  If a court
of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance,
that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible,
the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable. If the offending provision
cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity,
or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement. 

Sole Discretion of Lender.
 Whenever Lender's consent or approval is required under this Agreement, the decision as to whether or not to consent or approve
shall be in the sole and exclusive discretion of Lender and Lender's decision shall be final and conclusive. 

Subsidiaries and Affiliates
of Borrower.  To the extent the context of any provisions of this Agreement makes it appropriate, including without limitation
any representation, warranty or covenant, the word  Borrower  as used in this Agreement shall include all of Borrower's
subsidiaries and affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing however, under no circumstances shall this Agreement be construed to
require Lender to make any Loan or other financial accommodation to any of Borrower's subsidiaries or affiliates. 

Successors and Assigns. 
All covenants and agreements by or on behalf of Borrower contained in this Agreement or any Related Documents shall bind Borrower's
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns. Borrower shall not, however, have
the right to assign Borrower's rights under this Agreement or any interest therein, without the prior written consent of Lender. 

Survival of Representations
and Warranties.  Borrower understands and agrees that in extending Loan Advances, Lender is relying on all representations,
warranties, and covenants made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered by Borrower to
Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents. Borrower further agrees that regardless of any investigation made by Lender,
all such representations, warranties and covenants will survive the extension of Loan Advances and delivery to Lender of the Related
Documents, shall be continuing in nature, shall be deemed made and redated by Borrower at the time each Loan Advance is made,
and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as Borrower's Indebtedness shall be paid in full, or until this Agreement
shall be terminated in the manner provided above, whichever is the last to occur. 

Time is of the Essence. 
Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. 

Waive Jury. All parties to
this Agreement hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any party against
any other party.

PROMISSORY NOTE   

PROMISE TO PAY. Landmark Bancorp, Inc.
( Borrower ) promises to pay to First National Bank of Omaha ( Lender ), or order, in lawful money of the
United States of America, the principal amount of Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand   00/100 Dollars ($7,500,000.00) or
so much as may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal balance of each advance. Interest shall
be calculated from the date of each advance until repayment of each advance.  

PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan
in one payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on November 1, 2017. In addition, Borrower will pay
regular quarterly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning February 1, 2017, with all subsequent
interest payments to be due on the same day of each quarter after that. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law,
payments will be applied to interest, principal, and expenses owing under the Note in an order determined by Lender. Borrower
will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing.  

VARIABLE INTEREST RATE.  The interest
rate on this Note is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the U.S. Prime Rate
as published by the Wall Street Journal and currently is determined by the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least seventy
percent (70%) of the nations ten (10) largest banks (the  Index ). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged
by Lender on its loans. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index
after notifying Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will
not occur more often than each day during the term of the loan. At Lender's option, the Index and/or the interest rate may be
rounded upwards to the next higher one one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based
on other rates as well.  The Index currently is 3.500% per annum.  Interest on the unpaid principal balance of this Note
will be calculated as described in the  INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD  paragraph using a rate of 0.250 percentage points
under the Index, resulting in an initial rate of 3.250% per annum based on a year of 360 days. NOTICE: Under no circumstances
will the interest rate on this Note be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.  Unless waived by Lender, any increase
in the interest rate will increase the amounts of Borrower's interest payments.  

INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest
on this Note is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied
by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All interest
payable under this Note is computed using this method.  

PREPAYMENT.  Borrower may pay without
penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing,
relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments of accrued unpaid interest. Rather, early payments will
reduce the principal balance due. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked  paid in full ,  without recourse ,
or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this Note,
and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender . All written communications concerning disputed
amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes  payment in full 
of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must
be mailed or delivered to: First National Bank of Omaha, Downtown- Corporate Banking Group, 1620 Dodge St SC 1031, Omaha, NE 68197.  

LATE CHARGE.  If a payment is 10
days or more late, Borrower will be charged  3.000% of the regularly scheduled payment or $25.00, whichever is greater.  

INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT . Upon default,
including failure to pay upon final maturity, the interest rate on this Note shall be increased by adding an additional 6.000
percentage point margin ( Default Rate Margin ). The Default Rate Margin shall also apply to each succeeding interest
rate change that would have applied had there been no default. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum
interest rate limitations under applicable law. 

DEFAULT.  Each of the following
shall constitute an event of default ( Event of Default ) under this Note: 

Payment Default.  Borrower
fails to make any payment when due under this Note.

Default in Favor of Third
Parties . Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement,
or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower's property or Borrower's
ability to repay this Note or perform Borrower's obligations under this Note or any of the related documents. 

False Statements.  Any
warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower's behalf, or made by Guarantor, or

method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the loan. This includes a garnishment
of any of Borrower's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there
is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture
proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies
or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being
an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.

to assume all costs including by way of illustration and not limitation, actual expenses, legal fees and marketing losses for
failing to reasonably comply with Lender requests within thirty (30) days. 

U.S.A. PATRIOT ACT.  To help
the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA PATRIOT Act requires all banks to obtain

or not such is specified therein. Borrower acknowledges that some Loan Documents will be preprinted forms and that it is the intent
of Borrower and Lender that all Loans and Guaranties by Borrower or any affiliate or subsidiary of Borrower with or in favor of
Lender be cross-defaulted with each other. 

CONSENT TO PARTICIPATION.  Borrower
agrees and consents to Lender's sale or transfer, whether now or later, or one or more participation interest in this loan to
one or more purchasers, whether related or unrelated to Lender. Lender may provide, without any limitation whatsoever, to any
one or more purchasers, or potential purchasers, any information or knowledge Lender may have about Borrower or about any other
matter relating to the Loan, and Borrower hereby waives any rights to privacy it may have with respect to such matters. Borrower
additionally waives any and all notices of sale of participation interest, as well as all notices of any repurchase of such participation
interests. Borrower also agrees that the purchasers of any such participation interest will be considered as the absolute owners
of such interests in the Loan and will have all the rights granted under the participation agreement or agreements governing the

against Lender or against any purchaser of such a participation interest and unconditionally agrees that either Lender or such
purchaser may enforce Borrower's obligation under the Loan irrespective of the failure or insolvency of any holder of any interest
in the Loan. Borrower further agrees that the purchaser of any such participation interests may enforce its interest irrespective
of any personal claims or defenses that Borrower may have against Lender.

any length of time) this loan or release any party or guarantor or collateral; or impair, fail to realize upon or perfect Lender's
security interest in the collateral; and take any other action deemed necessary by Lender without the consent of or notice to
anyone. All such parties also agree that Lender may modify this loan without the consent of or notice to anyone other than the
party with whom the modification is made. The obligations under this Note are joint and several.

by law. Grantor authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the Indebtedness

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH
RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL.  Grantor represents and warrants to Lender that: 

Ownership.  Grantor is
the lawful owner of the Collateral free and clear of all security interests, liens, encumbrances and claims of others except as

Right to Pledge.  Grantor
has the full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to pledge the Collateral. 

Authority; Binding Effect.

are and shall be continuing in nature and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as this Agreement is terminated
or cancelled as provided herein. 

No Further Assignment.

No Violation.  The execution
and delivery of this Agreement will not violate any law or agreement governing Grantor or to which Grantor is a party, and its
certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws do not prohibit any term or condition of this Agreement. 

Financing Statements. 
Grantor authorizes Lender to file a UCC financing statement, or alternatively, a copy of this Agreement to perfect Lender's security
interest. At Lender's request, Grantor additionally agrees to sign all other documents that are necessary to perfect, protect,

things as hiring other people, such as attorneys, appraisers or other experts. Lender may charge Grantor for any cost incurred
in so doing. When applicable law provides more than one method of perfection of Lender's security interest, Lender may choose
the method(s) to be used. If the Collateral consists of stock, bonds or other investment property for which no certificate has
been issued, Grantor agrees, at Lender's request, either to request issuance of an appropriate certificate or to give instructions
on Lender's forms to the issuer, transfer agent, mutual fund company, or broker, as the case may be, to record on its books or

shall choose, whether or not matured. 

Transactions with Others.
 Lender may (1) extend time for payment or other performance, (2) grant a renewal or change in terms or conditions, or (3)
compromise, compound or release any obligation, with any one or more Obligors, endorsers, or Guarantors of the Indebtedness as
Lender deems advisable, without obtaining the prior written consent of Grantor, and no such act or failure to act shall affect
Lender's rights against Grantor or the Collateral. 

All Collateral Secures Indebtedness.
 All Collateral shall be security for the Indebtedness, whether the Collateral is located at one or more offices or branches
of Lender. This will be the case whether or not the office or branch where Grantor obtained Grantor's loan knows about the Collateral
or relies upon the Collateral as security. 

Collection of Collateral .
Lender at Lender's option may, but need not, collect the Income and Proceeds directly from the Obligors. Grantor authorizes and
directs the Obligors, if Lender decides to collect the Income and Proceeds, to pay and deliver to Lender all Income and Proceeds
from the Collateral and to accept Lender's receipt for the payments. 

Power of Attorney.  Grantor
irrevocably appoints Lender as Grantor's attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, (a) to demand, collect, receive, receipt
for, sue and recover all Income and Proceeds and other sums of money and other property which may now or hereafter become due,
owing or payable from the Obligors in accordance with the terms of the Collateral; (b) to execute, sign and endorse any and all
instruments, receipts, checks, drafts and warrants issued in payment for the Collateral; (c) to settle or compromise any and all
claims arising under the Collateral, and in the place and stead of Grantor, execute and deliver Grantor's release and acquittance
for Grantor; (d) to file any claim or claims or to take any action or institute or take part in any proceedings, either in Lender's
own name or in the name of Grantor, or otherwise, which in the discretion of Lender may seem to be necessary or advisable; and
(e) to execute in Grantor's name and to deliver to the Obligors on Grantor's behalf, at the time and in the manner specified by
the Collateral, any necessary instruments or documents. 

Perfection of Security Interest.
 Upon Lender's request, Grantor will deliver to Lender any and all of the documents evidencing or constituting the Collateral.
When applicable law provides more than one method of perfection of Lender's security interest, Lender may choose the method(s)
to be used. Upon Lender's request, Grantor will sign and deliver any writings necessary to perfect Lender's security interest.
If any of the Collateral consists of securities for which no certificate has been issued, Grantor agrees, at Lender's option,
either to request issuance of an appropriate certificate or to execute appropriate instructions on Lender's forms instructing
the issuer, transfer agent, mutual fund company, or broker, as the case may be, to record on its books or records, by book-entry
or otherwise, Lender's security interest in the Collateral. Grantor hereby appoints Lender as Grantor's irrevocable attorney-in-fact
for the purpose of executing any documents necessary to perfect, amend, or to continue the security interest granted in this Agreement
or to demand termination of filings of other secured parties.  This is a continuing Security Agreement and will continue in
effect even though all or any part of the Indebtedness is paid in full and even though for a period of time Grantor may not be
indebted to Lender.  

LENDER'S EXPENDITURES . If any action
or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Collateral or if Grantor fails to comply with
any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor's failure to discharge or pay when
due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor's behalf
may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or
paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and
paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for
such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date
of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will (A) be payable
on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become
due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as
a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity. The Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts.
Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default. 

LIMITATIONS ON OBLIGATIONS OF LENDER .
Lender shall use ordinary reasonable care in the physical preservation and custody of the Collateral in Lender's possession, but
shall have no other obligation to protect the Collateral or its value. In particular, but without limitation, Lender shall have
no responsibility for (A) any depreciation in value of the Collateral or for the collection or protection of any Income and Proceeds
from the Collateral, (B) preservation of rights against parties to the Collateral or against third persons, (C) ascertaining any
maturities, calls, conversions, exchanges, offers, tenders, or similar matters relating to any of the Collateral, or (D) informing
Grantor about any of the above, whether or not Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. Except as provided above,
Lender shall have no liability for depreciation or deterioration of the Collateral. 

DEFAULT.  Each of the following
shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment Default.  Grantor
fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. 

Other Defaults.  Grantor
fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of
the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement
between Lender and Grantor. 

Default in Favor of Third
Parties.  Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other
agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Grantor's property or ability to perform
Grantor's obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents. 

False Statements . Any
warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Grantor or on Grantor's behalf under this Agreement or the
Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false
or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Defective Collateralization.
 This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral
document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Insolvency . The dissolution
or termination of Grantor's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part
of Grantor's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding
under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Grantor. 

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.
 Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other
method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Indebtedness. This includes
a garnishment of any of Grantor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not
apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the
creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits
with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole
discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Events Affecting Guarantor.
 Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party of any of the Indebtedness
or guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party dies or becomes incompetent or revokes or disputes the validity of, or
liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Adverse Change.  A material
adverse change occurs in Grantor's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness
is impaired. 

Insecurity.  Lender in
good faith believes itself insecure. 

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. 
If an Event of Default occurs under this Agreement, at any time thereafter, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following
rights and remedies: 

Accelerate Indebtedness.
 Declare all Indebtedness, including any prepayment penalty which Grantor would be required to pay, immediately due and payable,
without notice of any kind to Grantor. 

Collect the Collateral. 
Collect any of the Collateral and, at Lender's option and to the extent permitted by applicable law, retain possession of the
Collateral while suing on the Indebtedness. 

Sell the Collateral. 
Sell the Collateral, at Lender's discretion, as a unit or in parcels, at one or more public or private sales. Unless the Collateral
is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Lender shall
give or mail to Grantor, and other persons as required by law, notice at least ten (10) days in advance of the time and place
of any public sale, or of the time after which any private sale may be made. However, no notice need be provided to any person
who, after an Event of Default occurs, enters into and authenticates an agreement waiving that person's right to notification
of sale. Grantor agrees that any requirement of reasonable notice as to Grantor is satisfied if Lender mails notice by ordinary
mail addressed to Grantor at the last address Grantor has given Lender in writing. If a public sale is held, there shall be sufficient
compliance with all requirements of notice to the public by a single publication in any newspaper of general circulation in the
county where the Collateral is located, setting forth the time and place of sale and a brief description of the property to be
sold. Lender may be a purchaser at any public sale. 

Sell Securities.  Sell
any securities included in the Collateral in a manner consistent with applicable federal and state securities laws. If, because
of restrictions under such laws, Lender is unable, or believes Lender is unable, to sell the securities in an open market transaction,
Grantor agrees that Lender will have no obligation to delay sale until the securities can be registered. Then Lender may make
a private sale to one or more persons or to a restricted group of persons, even though such sale may result in a price that is
less favorable than might be obtained in an open market transaction. Such a sale will be considered commercially reasonable. If
any securities held as Collateral are  restricted securities  as defined in the Rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (such as Regulation D or Rule 144) or the rules of state securities departments under state  Blue Sky  laws,
or if Grantor or any other owner of the Collateral is an affiliate of the issuer of the securities, Grantor agrees that neither
Grantor, nor any member of Grantor's family, nor any other person signing this Agreement will sell or dispose of any securities
of such issuer without obtaining Lender's prior written consent. 

Rights and Remedies with
Respect to Investment Property, Financial Assets and Related Collateral.  In addition to other rights and remedies granted
under this Agreement and under applicable law, Lender may exercise any or all of the following rights and remedies: (1) register
with any issuer or broker or other securities intermediary any of the Collateral consisting of investment property or financial
assets (collectively herein,  investment property ) in Lender's sole name or in the name of Lender's broker, agent or
nominee; (2) cause any issuer, broker or other securities intermediary to deliver to Lender any of the Collateral consisting of
securities, or investment property capable of being delivered; (3) enter into a control agreement or power of attorney with any
issuer or securities intermediary with respect to any Collateral consisting of investment property, on such terms as Lender may
deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, including without limitation, an agreement granting to Lender any of the rights provided
hereunder without further notice to or consent by Grantor; (4) execute any such control agreement on Grantor's behalf and in Grantor's
name, and hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as agent and attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, for the purpose of executing
such control agreement on Grantor's behalf; (5) exercise any and all rights of Lender under any such control agreement or power
of attorney; (6) exercise any voting, conversion, registration, purchase, option, or other rights with respect to any Collateral;
(7) collect, with or without legal action, and issue receipts concerning any notes, checks, drafts, remittances or distributions
that are paid or payable with respect to any Collateral consisting of investment property. Any control agreement entered with
respect to any investment property shall contain the following provisions, at Lender's discretion. Lender shall be authorized
to instruct the issuer, broker or other securities intermediary to take or to refrain from taking such actions with respect to
the investment property as Lender may instruct, without further notice to or consent by Grantor. Such actions may include without
limitation the issuance of entitlement orders, account instructions, general trading or buy or sell orders, transfer and redemption
orders, and stop loss orders. Lender shall be further entitled to instruct the issuer, broker or securities intermediary to sell
or to liquidate any investment property, or to pay the cash surrender or account termination value with respect to any and all
investment property, and to deliver all such payments and liquidation proceeds to Lender. Any such control agreement shall contain
such authorizations as are necessary to place Lender in  control  of such investment collateral, as contemplated under
the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, and shall fully authorize Lender to issue  entitlement orders  concerning
the transfer, redemption, liquidation or disposition of investment collateral, in conformance with the provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code. 

Foreclosure.  Maintain
a judicial suit for foreclosure and sale of the Collateral. 

Transfer Title.  Effect
transfer of title upon sale of all or part of the Collateral. For this purpose, Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender as Grantor's
attorney-in-fact to execute endorsements, assignments and instruments in the name of Grantor and each of them (if more than one)
as shall be necessary or reasonable. 

Other Rights and Remedies .
Have and exercise any or all of the rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code,
at law, in equity, or otherwise. 

Application of Proceeds .
Apply any cash which is part of the Collateral, or which is received from the collection or sale of the Collateral, to reimbursement
of any expenses, including any costs for registration of securities, commissions incurred in connection with a sale, attorneys'
fees and court costs, whether or not there is a lawsuit and including any fees on appeal, incurred by Lender in connection with
the collection and sale of such Collateral and to the payment of the Indebtedness of Grantor to Lender, with any excess funds
to be paid to Grantor as the interests of Grantor may appear. Grantor agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to pay any deficiency
after application of the proceeds of the Collateral to the Indebtedness. 

Election of Remedies. 
Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement, the Related
Documents, or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to
pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform
an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor's failure to perform, shall not affect Lender's right to declare
a default and exercise its remedies. 

ELECTRONIC COPIES.  Lender may copy,
electronically or otherwise, and thereafter destroy, the originals of this Agreement and/or Related Documents in the regular course
of Lender s business. All such copies produced from an electronic form or by any other reliable means (i.e., photographic
image or facsimile) shall in all respects be considered equivalent to an original, and Borrower hereby waives any rights or objections
to the use of such copies. 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  The following
miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement:

expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including

Choice of Venue.  If there
is a lawsuit, Grantor agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Douglas County, State of Nebraska. 

No Waiver by Lender. 
Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by
Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other
right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender's right otherwise
to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course
of dealing between Lender and Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender's rights or of any of Grantor's obligations
as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by
Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all
cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender. 

Notices.  Any notice required
to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when actually received

written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party's address. For notice purposes,
Grantor agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Grantor's current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law,
if there is more than one Grantor, any notice given by Lender to any Grantor is deemed to be notice given to all Grantors. 

Severability.  If a court
of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance,
that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible,
the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable. If the offending provision
cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity,
or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement. 

Successors and Assigns .
Subject to any limitations stated in this Agreement on transfer of Grantor's interest, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. If ownership of the Collateral becomes vested in a person other
than Grantor, Lender, without notice to Grantor, may deal with Grantor's successors with reference to this Agreement and the Indebtedness
by way of forbearance or extension without releasing Grantor from the obligations of this Agreement or liability under the Indebtedness. 

Time is of the Essence.

                                         of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially

                                         of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
                                         report based on such evaluation; and

                                         most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case
                                         of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
                                         affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed,
                                         based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to

                                         likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize
