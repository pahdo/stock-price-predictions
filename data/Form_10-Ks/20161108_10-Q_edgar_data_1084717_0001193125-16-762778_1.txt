    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   
 (Unaudited)    A complete set of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements is a part of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K filed March 14, 2016. The notes below are included due to material changes in the consolidated financial statements or to provide the reader with additional
information not otherwise available. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. All dollar
amounts in the following notes are expressed in thousands, except share and per share amounts or where otherwise indicated.    Certain amounts contained in
the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate to conform to the financial statement presentation used in the current period. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income,
earnings per share or retained earnings.     NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
 The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pacific Continental Corporation (the  Company ), a
bank holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific Continental Bank (the  Bank ), and the Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries, PCB Services Corporation and PCB Loan Services Corporation (both of which are presently inactive).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.    The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by the Company without audit and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information. The consolidated financial statements include all
adjustments and normal accruals, which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for such interim periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as of the date of the balance sheets and income and expenses for the periods. Areas including allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangibles and other real estate owned are
particularly susceptible to change, and actual results could differ from those estimates.    The balance sheet data as of December 31,
2015, was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures contained in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
December 31, 2015, consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K.

   NOTE 2   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS   
 On September 6, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the common stock of Foundation Bancorp, Inc. (Foundation Bancorp) and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Foundation Bank, of Bellevue, Washington (the  Merger ). The acquisition of Foundation Bank reflects the Company s overall banking expansion strategy, and expanded the combined Bank s presence in the
greater Puget Sound market.    The transaction has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities were recorded
at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates, however some valuations related to some other real estate owned properties are pending and could cause goodwill to change. The application of the acquisition method resulted in the
recognition of preliminary goodwill of $21,407 which is all attributable to the value of Foundation Bank s lending and deposit gathering banking activities. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes as the Merger was accounted
for as a tax-free exchange.    A summary of the net assets acquired and the estimated fair value adjustments of Foundation Bancorp are presented below:  
   
   Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, former Foundation Bancorp shareholders received either $12.50 per share in cash
or 0.7911 shares of Pacific Continental common stock for each share of Foundation Bancorp common stock, or a combination of 30.0% in the form of cash and 70.0% in the form of Pacific Continental common stock. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the
maximum aggregate cash component of the merger consideration was $19,337 and the aggregate stock component of the merger consideration was 2,853,361 shares of Pacific Continental common stock, the value of which was calculated based on a closing
stock price of $16.75 per share. The cash election was oversubscribed; therefore shareholders electing all cash received $8.72 in cash and 0.23915 shares of Pacific Continental common stock for each share of Foundation Bancorp common stock. Former
Foundation Bancorp shareholders making a valid mixed election received $3.75 in cash and 0.55377 shares of Pacific Continental common stock for each share of Foundation Bancorp common stock.  
 The operations of Foundation Bank are included in the operating results beginning September 6, 2016. Foundation Bank s results of operations prior
to the acquisition are not included in the operating results. Revenue information for Foundation Bank related revenue and expense cannot be practically separated from Pacific Continental, therefore proforma revenue disclosures have not been
included. Merger-related expense of $1,767 were recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and were $3,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and are included within the merger-related expense line item on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

   NOTE 3   SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE   
 The amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities available-for-sale at September 30, 2016, were as follows:  
   
   At September 30, 2016, the Bank held 484 investment securities, of which 61 were in unrealized loss
positions. Unrealized losses existed on certain securities classified as obligations of US government agencies, private-label mortgage-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, SBA pools obligations of states and political subdivisions, and
corporate securities. The unrealized losses on all securities are deemed to be temporary, as these securities retain strong credit ratings, continue to perform adequately, and are backed by various government sponsored enterprises. These decreases
in fair value are associated with the changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of the securities, and not due to concerns regarding the underlying credit of the issuers or the underlying
collateral. The decline in value of these securities has resulted from changes in interest rates relative to where these investments fall within the yield curve and their individual characteristics. Because the Company does not currently intend to
sell these securities nor does the Company consider it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be upon maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to
be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  
      12  

Table of Contents  

  The following table presents a summary of securities in a continuous unrealized loss position at
September 30, 2016:      
   On a monthly basis, management reviews all private-label mortgage-backed securities for the presence of other
than temporary impairment ( OTTI ) and recorded $2 and $0 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management s evaluation included the use of independently-generated third-party credit
surveillance reports that analyze the loans underlying each security. These reports include estimates of default rates and severities, life collateral loss rates and static voluntary prepayment assumptions to generate estimated cash flows at the
individual security level. Additionally, management considered factors such as downgraded credit ratings, severity and duration of the impairments, the stability of the issuers and any discounts paid when the securities were purchased. Management
has considered all available information related to the collectability of the impaired investment securities and believes that the estimated credit loss is appropriate.  
 Following is a tabular roll-forward of the aggregate amount of credit-related OTTI at the beginning and end of the periods presented along with
the amounts recognized in earnings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015:      
   At September 30, 2016, ten of the Company s private-label mortgage-backed securities, with an
amortized cost of $1,440, were classified as substandard as their underlying credit was considered impaired. At December 31, 2015, six securities with an amortized cost of $1,506 were classified as substandard.  
 At September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the projected average life of the securities portfolio was 4.72 years and 4.21 years,
respectively.

  The amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities available-for-sale at
December 31, 2015, were as follows:      
   At December 31, 2015, the Bank held 432 investment securities, of which 92 were in unrealized loss
positions. The following table presents a summary of securities in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015:

  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities at September 30, 2016, by
maturity, are shown below. Obligations of U.S. government agencies, states and political subdivisions and corporate securities are shown by contractual maturity. Mortgage-backed securities and SBA variable pools are shown by projected average life.
     
   During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 30 investment securities were sold resulting in proceeds of
$54,426. The sales generated no gain or loss as they related to sales of securities acquired from Foundation Bank, which were sold at their acquisition date fair value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 60 investment securities
were sold resulting in proceeds of $98,309. The sales generated a gross gain of $552 and a gross loss of $243, totaling a net gain of $309. The specific identification method was used to determine the cost of the securities sold.  
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, 19 investment securities were sold resulting in proceeds of $21,069. The sales generated a
gross gain of $143 and a gross loss of $0, totaling a net gain of $143. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 41 investment securities were sold resulting in proceeds of $35,216. The sales generated a gross gain of $585 and a gross
loss of $249, totaling a net gain of $336. The specific identification method was used to determine the cost of the securities sold.    The
following table presents investment securities which were pledged to secure public deposits and repurchase agreements as permitted or required by law:      
   At September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, there was an outstanding balance for repurchase
agreements of $1,107, and $71, respectively.

   NOTE 4 - LOANS, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, AND CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS   
 Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal net of loan premiums or discounts for purchased loans, net of deferred loan origination
fees, discounts associated with retained portions of loans sold, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans is calculated using the simple-interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding. Loan origination fees, net of
origination costs and discounts, are amortized over the lives of the loans as adjustments to yield.    Major classifications of period-end
loans are as follows:      
   At September 30, 2016, outstanding loans to dental professionals totaled $370,135 and represented 20.46%
of total outstanding loan principal balances compared to dental professional loans of $340,162 or 24.19% of total outstanding loan principal balance at December 31, 2015. Additional information about the Company s dental portfolio can be
found in Note 5. There are no other industry concentrations in excess of 10% of the total loan portfolio. However, as of September 30, 2016, 64.72% of the Company s loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate and is, therefore,
susceptible to changes in local market conditions. While appropriate action is taken to manage identified concentration risks, management believes that the loan portfolio is well diversified by geographic location and among industry groups.

   Allowance for Loan Losses   
 The allowance for loan losses is established as an amount that management considers adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans within
the portfolio. The allowance consists of general, specific and unallocated components. The general component is based upon all loans collectively evaluated for impairment. The specific component is based upon all loans individually evaluated for
impairment. The unallocated component represents credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the general risk factors or the specific allowance analysis. Loans are charged against the allowance when management
believes the collection of principal and interest is unlikely.    The Company performs regular credit reviews of the loan portfolio to
determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards. When loans are originated, they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process. The Company s
internal risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from one to ten, where a higher rating represents higher risk. The ten-point risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan
losses.    Estimated credit losses reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio. The
historical loss rate for each group of loans with similar risk characteristics is determined based on the Company s own loss experience in that group. Historical loss experience and recent trends in losses provide a reasonable starting point
for analysis, however, they do not by themselves form a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses. Qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from
historical losses are also considered, including but not limited to:      

Changes in international, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments,    

Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans,        

Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans,    

Changes in the quality of the institution s loan review system,        

Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans,        

The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations,        

The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution s existing portfolio,    

Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses, and    

Changes in the current and future U.S. political environment, including debt ceiling negotiations, government shutdown and healthcare reform that may affect national, regional and local economic conditions, taxation, or
disruption of national or global financial markets.      The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for
unfunded commitments is determined using a consistent, systematic methodology and is monitored regularly based on management s evaluation of numerous factors. For each portfolio segment, these factors include:  

The quality of the current loan portfolio,        

The trend in the migration of the loan portfolio s risk ratings,        

The velocity of migration of losses and potential losses,        

Current economic conditions,        

Loan concentrations,        

Loan growth rates,        

Past-due and nonperforming trends,        

Evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans,        

Recovery experience, and        

Peer comparison loss rates.

  A summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan classification follows:
     
   At September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses on dental loans was $4,798, compared to $4,022 at
December 31, 2015. See Note 5 for additional information on the dental loan portfolio.  
      19  

Table of Contents  

  The following table presents the allowance and recorded investment in loans by major loan
classification at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   The September 30, 2016, ending allowance includes $738 in specific allowance for $10,549 of impaired loans
($9,551 net of government guarantees). At December 31, 2015, the Company had $8,800 of impaired loans ($7,527 net of government guarantees) with a specific allowance of $175 assigned.  
 Management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate as of September 30, 2016. However, future loan losses may exceed the
levels provided for in the allowance for loan losses and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan losses.

   Credit Quality Indicators   
 The Company uses the following loan grades, which are also often used by regulators when assessing the credit quality of a loan portfolio.  
  Pass    Credit exposure in this category range between the highest credit quality to average credit quality. Primary repayment
sources generate satisfactory debt service coverage under normal conditions. Cash flow from recurring sources is expected to continue to produce adequate debt service capacity. There are many levels of credit quality contained in the Pass
definition, but none of the loans contained in this category rise to the level of Special Mention. This category includes loans with an internal risk rating of 1-6.  
  Special Mention    A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left
uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an
institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. The Bank strictly and carefully employs the FDIC definition in assessing assets that may apply to this category. It is apparent that, in many cases, asset weaknesses relevant to this
definition either (1) better fit a definition of a  well-defined weakness,  or (2) in management s experience, ultimately migrate to worse risk grade categories, such as Substandard and Doubtful. Consequently, management
elects to downgrade most potential Special Mention credits to Substandard or Doubtful, and therefore adopts a conservative risk grade process in the use of the Special Mention risk grade. This category includes loans with an internal risk rating of
7.     Substandard    A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower
or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loans in this category are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will
sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified Substandard. This category includes loans with an internal
risk rating of 8.     Doubtful    An asset classified as Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard,
with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. This category includes loans with an internal risk rating
of 9.    Management strives to consistently apply these definitions when allocating its loans by loan grade. The loan portfolio is
continuously monitored for changes in credit quality and management takes appropriate action to update the loan risk ratings accordingly. Management has not changed the Company s policy towards its use of credit quality indicators during the
periods reported.

   Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans   
 The Company uses the terms  past due  and  delinquent  interchangeably. Amortizing loans are considered past due or
delinquent based upon the number of contractually required payments not made. Delinquency status for all contractually matured loans, commercial and commercial real estate loans with non-monthly amortization, and all other extensions of credit is
determined based upon the number of calendar months past due.    The following tables present an aging analysis of past due and nonaccrual
loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:     Age Analysis of Loans Receivable

   Impaired Loans   
 Regular credit reviews of the portfolio are performed to identify loans that are considered potentially impaired. Potentially impaired loans
are referred to the Asset-Liability Committee  ALCO  for review and are included in the specific calculation of allowance for loan losses. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, the Company is unlikely
to collect all principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. When the amount of the impairment represents a confirmed loss, it is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans are often reported net of
government guarantees to the extent that the guarantees are expected to be collected. Impaired loans generally include all loans classified as nonaccrual and troubled debt restructurings.  
 Accrual of interest is discontinued on impaired loans when management believes that, after considering economic and business conditions and
collection efforts, the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal or interest is doubtful. Accrued, but uncollected, interest is generally reversed when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest income is
subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received satisfying all delinquent principal and interest amounts, and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain. In accordance with
GAAP, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance and no interest income is recognized. Interest income may be recognized on impaired loans that are not on nonaccrual status.

   Troubled Debt Restructurings   
 In the normal course of business, the Company may modify the terms of certain loans, attempting to protect as much of its investment as
possible. Management evaluates the circumstances surrounding each modification to determine whether it is a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). TDRs exist when 1) the restructuring constitutes a concession, and 2) the debtor is
experiencing financial difficulties.    The following table displays the Company s TDRs by class at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:      
   The recorded investment in TDRs on nonaccrual status totaled $2,228, and $1,807 at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s policy is that loans placed on nonaccrual will typically remain on nonaccrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospect for future payment in
accordance with the loan agreement appears relatively certain. The Company s policy generally refers to a minimum of six months of payment performance as sufficient to warrant a return to accrual status.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company restructured 9 loans into TDRs for which impairment was previously measured
under the Company s general loan loss allowance methodology.    The types of modifications offered can generally be described in the
following categories:      

Rate Modification  -   A modification in which the interest rate is modified.    

Term Modification  -   A modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments, or frequency of payments is changed.    

Interest-only Modification  -   A modification in which the loan is converted to interest-only payments for a period of time.    

Combination Modification  -   Any other type of modification, including the use of multiple types of modifications.

   NOTE 5   DENTAL LOAN PORTFOLIO   
 Dental lending is not operated as a business segment, and dental loans are made in the normal course of commercial lending activities
throughout the Company. However, to assist in understanding the concentrations and risks associated with the Company s loan portfolio, the following Note has been included to provide additional information relating to the Company s dental
loan portfolio. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans to dental professionals totaled $370,135, and $340,162, respectively, and represented 20.46%, and 24.19% in principal amount of total outstanding loans, respectively. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, dental loans were supported by government guarantees totaling $6,852 and $9,027, respectively. These guarantees represented 1.85%, and 2.65% in principal amount of the outstanding dental loan
balances as of such respective dates. The Company defines a  dental loan  as a loan to dental professionals for the purpose of practice expansion, acquisition or other purpose supported by the cash flows of a dental practice.  
  Loan Classification   
 Major classifications of dental loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:  
   
    Market Area   
 The Bank s principal  market area  is within the States of Oregon and Washington west of the Cascade Mountain Range. This area
is serviced by branch locations in Eugene, Portland and Puget Sound. The Company also makes national dental loans throughout the United States, and currently has dental loans in 43 states. National loan relationships are maintained and serviced by
Bank personnel primarily located in Portland.    The following table summarizes the Company s dental lending by borrower location:  

29  

Table of Contents  

   Allowance   
 The allowance for loan losses identified for the dental loan portfolio is established as an amount that management considers adequate to absorb
possible losses on existing loans within the dental portfolio. The allowance related to the dental loan portfolio consists of general and specific components. The general component is based upon all dental loans collectively evaluated for
impairment, including qualitative conditions associated with: loan type, out-of-market location, start-up financing, practice acquisition financing, and specialty practice financing. The specific component is based upon dental loans individually
evaluated for impairment.      
    Credit Quality

   NOTE 6   FEDERAL FUNDS AND OVERNIGHT FUNDS PURCHASED   
 The Company had unsecured federal funds borrowing lines with various correspondent banks totaling $129,000 at both September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The terms of the lines are subject to change with interest payable at the then stated rate. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding on these lines.  
 The Company also had a secured overnight borrowing line available from the Federal Reserve Bank that totaled $81,915 and $76,912 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Federal Reserve Bank borrowing line is secured through the pledging of $144,242 and $140,801 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, of commercial
loans under the Company s Borrower-In-Custody program. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings on this line. The terms of the lines are subject to change with interest payable at the then
stated rate.     NOTE 7   FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK BORROWINGS   
 The Company has a borrowing limit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB ) equal to 35% of total assets, subject to the
value of discounted collateral pledged and stock holdings.    At September 30, 2016, the maximum borrowing line was $888,671; however,
the FHLB borrowing line was limited by the discounted value of collateral pledged. At September 30, 2016, the Company had pledged $827,300 in real estate loans to the FHLB that had a discounted collateral value of $602,715. There was $45,500
borrowed on this line at September 30, 2016.    At December 31, 2015, the maximum borrowing line was $657,086; however, the FHLB
borrowing line was limited by the discounted value of collateral pledged. At December 31, 2015, the Company had pledged $666,297 in real estate loans to the FHLB that had a discounted collateral value of $414,044. There was $77,500 borrowed on
this line at December 31, 2015.    Below is a summary of outstanding FHLB borrowings by maturity.

   NOTE 8   BORROWED FUNDS   
  Subordinated Debentures   
 In June 2016, the Company issued $35,000 in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures (the
 Notes ) in a public offering. The Notes are callable at par after five years, have a stated maturity of September 30, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.875% per year, from and including June 27, 2016, but
excluding September 30, 2021. From and including September 30, 2021 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then-current three-month LIBOR plus 471.5
basis points.    The Notes are included in Tier 2 capital (with certain limitations applicable) under current regulatory guidelines and
interpretations.     Junior Subordinated Debentures   
 In November 2005, the Company completed the private placement of $8,000 in aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities (the
 TPS ), through its subsidiary, Pacific Continental Capital Trust I. The interest rate on the TPS was 6.265% until January 2011, after which it was converted to a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 135 basis points. The TPS mature in
2035, but are callable by the Company at par any time after January 7, 2011. The Company issued $8,248 of junior subordinated debentures (the  Debentures ) to the trust in exchange for ownership of all of the common security of the
trust and the proceeds of the preferred securities sold by the trust. In accordance with current accounting guidance, the trust is not consolidated in the Company s financial statements, but rather the Foundation Debentures are shown as a
liability. The interest rate on the Debentures was 6.265% until January 2011, after which it was converted to a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 135 basis points. The Debentures have the same prepayment provisions as the TPS.  
 On September 6, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Foundation Bancorp. At that time, the Company assumed ownership of
Foundation Statutory Trust I, which had previously issued $6,000 in aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities. The interest rate on the these trust preferred securities is a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 173 basis points.
The Company also acquired $6,148 of junior subordinated debentures (the  Foundation Debentures ) to the trust in exchange for ownership of all of the common security of the trust and the proceeds of the preferred securities sold by the
trust. In accordance with current accounting guidance, the trust is not consolidated in the Company s financial statements, but rather the Foundation Debentures are shown as a liability, and acquired at an acquisition date fair value of $3,013.
   The Debentures and the Foundation Debentures are included in the Company s Tier I capital (with certain limitations applicable) under
current regulatory guidelines and interpretations.     NOTE 9   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION   
 The Company s 2006 Stock Option and Equity Compensation Plan (the  2006 SOEC Plan ) authorizes the award of up to 1,550,000
shares in stock-based awards. The awards granted under this plan are service-based and are subject to vesting. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may impose any terms or conditions on the vesting of an award that it determines to
be appropriate. Awards granted generally vest over four years and have a maximum life of ten years. Awards may be granted at exercise prices of not less than 100.00% of the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the grant date.  
 Pursuant to the 2006 SOEC Plan, incentive stock options ( ISOs ), nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units ( RSUs ), or stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) may be awarded to attract and retain the best available personnel to the Corporation and its subsidiary. SARs may be settled in common stock or cash as determined at the date
of issuance. Liability-based awards (including all cash-settled SARs) have no impact on the number of shares available to be issued within the plan. Additionally, non-qualified option awards and restricted stock awards may be granted to directors
under the terms of this plan.

  At September 30, 2016, the Company had estimated unrecognized compensation expense of
approximately $3,811 for unvested RSUs. This amount is based on a historical forfeiture rate of 13.00% for all RSUs granted to employees. The weighted-average period of time the unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized for the unvested
RSUs was approximately 2.75 years as of September 30, 2016.     NOTE 10   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS   
 The Bank purchases derivative instruments as a way to help mitigate interest rate risk. During the first quarter 2013, the Company entered into
an interest rate swap agreement with an $8,000 notional amount to convert its variable-rate Debentures debt into a fixed rate for a term of seven years at a rate of 2.73%. The derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge. The cash flow hedge
meets the definition of highly effective and the Company expects the hedge to be highly effective throughout the remaining term of the swap. The fair value of the derivative instrument at September 30, 2016, was an $82 unrealized loss, which is
recorded in accrued interest and other payables on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company pledged $400 under collateral arrangements to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the interest rate swap contract.  
 The Bank maintains two interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers tied to loans on the consolidated balance sheet. Those interest
rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting the interest rate swaps that the Bank executes with a third party, such that the Bank minimizes its net risk exposure. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had
non-hedge designated interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $8,600 and $8,774, respectively, related to this program. The Bank does not require separately pledged collateral to secure its interest rate swaps with
customers. However, it does make a practice of cross-collateralizing the interest rate swaps with collateral on the underlying loan. The Bank has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted
collateral totaling $250 consisting of cash held on deposit for the benefit of the counterparty against its obligations under these agreements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
 The Bank entered into a swap with a third party to serve as a hedge to an equal amount of fixed rate loans. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Bank had one swap designated a hedging instrument with a notional amount of $1,500 and $1,525 respective, hedging a 10-year fixed rate note bearing interest at 5.71% and maturing August 2023. The notional amount does not
represent direct credit exposure. Direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amount to be received and paid. As the Bank has designated the swap a fair value hedge, the underlying hedged loan is carried at fair
value on the consolidated balance sheet and included in loans, net of deferred fees.    During third quarter 2016, the Bank entered into
forward-starting interest rate swaps, to convert certain existing and future short-term borrowings to fixed rate payments. The primary purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates, specifically LIBOR rates, which are a
benchmark for the short term borrowings. The hedging program qualifies as a cash flow hedge under FASB ASC 815, which provides for matching of the recognition of gains and losses of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items. The hedged item is
the LIBOR portion of the series of existing or future short-term fixed rate borrowings over the term of the interest rate swap. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is recorded in other comprehensive income. The Bank had notional
amounts of $26,500 subject to interest rate swaps to hedge anticipated future borrowings as of September 30, 2016. The unrealized loss, gross of the related tax benefit, on these interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2016 was $475. The
Company pledged cash totaling $1,250 under collateral arrangements to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the interest rate swap contract.

   NOTE 11   FAIR VALUE   
 The following disclosures about fair value of financial instruments are made in accordance with provisions of ASC 825  Financial
Instruments.  The use of different assumptions and estimation methods could have a significant effect on fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that might be realized in
a current market exchange.    The estimated fair values of the financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:
     
    Cash and cash equivalents    The carrying amount approximates fair value.  
  Securities available-for-sale    Fair value is based on quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value
is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.     Loans    For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and
have no significant change in credit risk, fair value is based on carrying values. Fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses or underlying collateral values, where applicable, and consider credit risk. The Company uses an independent
third-party to establish the fair value of loans.     Federal Home Loan Bank stock    The carrying amount represents the fair value
and value at which FHLB of Des Moines would redeem the stock.     Interest receivable and payable    The carrying amounts of
accrued interest receivable and payable approximate their fair value.     Bank-owned life insurance    The carrying amount is based
on cash surrender value which approximates fair value.     Interest rate swaps    Fair value is based on quoted market prices.  

      38  

Table of Contents  

   Deposits    Fair value of demand, interest bearing demand and savings deposits is the
amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair value of time deposits is estimated using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The Company uses an independent third-party to establish the fair value
of time deposits.     Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings    Fair value of FHLB borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash
flows at rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.     Subordinated debentures    Fair value
of subordinated debentures is estimated by discounting future cash flows at rates currently available for debt with similar credit risk, terms and remaining maturities.  
  Junior subordinated debentures    Fair value of junior subordinated debentures is estimated by discounting future cash flows at
rates currently available for debt with similar credit risk, terms and remaining maturities.     Off-balance sheet financial
instruments    The carrying amount and fair value are based on fees charged for similar commitments and are not material.    The
Company also adheres to the FASB guidance with regards to ASC 820,  Fair Value Measures.  This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement requires fair value measurement disclosure of all assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. The Company determines fair value based
upon quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as matrix or model pricing, when market quotes are not readily accessible or available. The valuation techniques used are based on observable and unobservable
inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:  

Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.        

Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose
significant value drivers are observable.        

Level 3   Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. The Company s own data used to develop unobservable inputs is adjusted for market
consideration when reasonably available.      Financial instruments, measured at fair value, are broken down in the tables below
by recurring or nonrecurring measurement status. Recurring assets are initially measured at fair value and are required to be remeasured at fair value in the financial statements at each reporting date. Assets measured on a nonrecurring basis are
assets that, due to an event or circumstance, were required to be remeasured at fair value after initial recognition in the financial statements at some time during the reporting period.

  The following is a description of the inputs and valuation methodologies used for assets and
liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value for all classes of available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments are estimated by obtaining quoted market prices for identical assets, where available. If such prices are
not available, fair value is based on independent asset pricing services and models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, prepayments, defaults,
cumulative loss projections and cash flows. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the periods reported.  
 The following table provides a reconciliation of private-label mortgage-backed securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   Fair value for all classes of available-for-sale securities is estimated by obtaining quoted market prices for
identical assets, where available. If such prices are not available, fair value is based on quoted prices for similar instruments or model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. In instances
where quoted prices for identical or similar instruments and observable inputs are not available, unobservable inputs, including the Company s own data, are used.  
 The Company utilizes FTN Financial as an independent third-party asset pricing service to estimate fair value on all of its available-for-sale
securities. The inputs used to value all securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research, market
indicators, and industry and economic trends. Additional inputs specific to each asset type are as follows:      

Obligations of U.S. government agencies    TRACE reported trades.        

Obligations of states and political subdivisions    MSRB reported trades, material event notices, and Municipal Market Data (MMD) benchmark yields.    

Private-label mortgage-backed securities    new issue data, monthly payment information, and collateral performance (whole loan collateral).    

Mortgage-backed securities    TBA prices and monthly payment information.        

SBA variable pools    TBA prices and monthly payment information.        

Corporate securities    TRACE reported trades.      Inputs may be prioritized
differently on any given day for any security and not all inputs listed are available for use in the evaluation process on any given day for each security evaluation.  
      42

  The valuation methodology used by asset type includes:  

Obligations of U.S. government agencies    security characteristics, defined sector break-down, benchmark yields, applied base spread, yield to maturity (bullet structures), corporate action adjustment, and
evaluations based on T+3 settlement.        

Obligations of states and political subdivisions    security characteristics, benchmark yields, applied base spread, yield to worst or market convention, ratings updates, prepayment schedules (housing bonds),
material event notice adjustments, and evaluations based on T+3 settlement.        

Private-label mortgage-backed securities    security characteristics, prepayment speeds, cash flows, TBA, Treasury and swap curves, IO/PO strips or floating indexes, applied base spread, spread adjustments,
yield to worst or market convention, ratings updates (whole-loan collateral), and evaluations based on T+0 settlement.        

Mortgage-backed securities    security characteristics, TBA, Treasury, or floating index benchmarks, spread to TBA levels, prepayment speeds, applied spreads, and evaluations based on T+0 settlement.

SBA pools    security characteristics, TBA, Treasury, or floating index benchmarks, spread to TBA levels, prepayment speeds, applied spreads, and evaluations based on T+0 settlement.    

Corporate securities    security characteristics, defined sector break-down, benchmark yields, applied based spread, yield to maturity (bullet structures), corporate action adjustment, and evaluations based
on T+3 settlement.      The third-party pricing service follows multiple review processes to assess the available market, credit
and deal-level information to support its valuation estimates. If sufficient objectively verifiable information is not available to support a security s valuation, an alternate independent evaluation source will be used.  
 The Company s securities portfolio was valued through its independent third-party pricing service using evaluated pricing models and
quoted prices based on market data. For further assurance, the Company s estimate of fair value was compared to an additional independent third-party estimate at June 30, 2016, and the Company obtained key inputs for a sample of securities
across sectors and evaluated those inputs for reasonableness. This analysis was performed at the individual security level and no material variances were noted.  
 There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the periods reported.

  The tables below show assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   The following is a description of the inputs and valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis.    Loans measured for impairment (net of government guarantees and specific reserves) include the estimated fair
value of collateral-dependent loans, less collectible government guarantees, as well as certain noncollateral-dependent loans measured for impairment with an allocated specific reserve. When a collateral-dependent loan is identified as impaired, the
value of the loan is measured using the current fair value of the collateral less selling costs. The fair value of collateral is generally estimated by obtaining external appraisals which are usually updated every 6 to 12 months based on the nature
of the impaired loans. Certain noncollateral-dependent loans measured for impairment with an allocated specific reserve are valued based upon the estimated net realizable value of the loan. If the estimated fair value of the impaired loan, less
collectible government guarantees, is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. The carrying value of the loan is adjusted to the estimated fair value. The carrying
value of loans fully charged off is zero.    Other real estate owned represents real estate which the Company has taken control of in partial
or full satisfaction of loans. At the time of foreclosure, other real estate owned is recorded at the lower of the carrying amount of the loan or fair value less costs to sell, which becomes the property s new basis. Any write downs based on
the asset s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After foreclosure, management periodically orders appraisals or performs valuations to ensure that the real estate is carried at the lower of its
new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Appraisals are generally updated every 6 to 12 months on other real estate owned. Fair value adjustments on other real estate owned are recognized within net loss on real estate owned.
The loss represents impairments on other real estate owned for fair value adjustments based on the fair value of the real estate.    There
have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the periods reported.

   NOTE 12   REGULATORY MATTERS   
 The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and receive periodic examinations by those
regulatory authorities. In addition, they are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory   and possibly additional
discretionary   actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must
meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company and the Bank s capital amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.  
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and
ratios of Total capital, Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets and, Tier 1 capital to leverage assets. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to
which they were subject.    As of September 30, 2016, and according to Federal Reserve and FDIC guidelines, the Bank was considered to
be well-capitalized. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum Total capital, Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets and, Tier 1 capital to leverage assets ratios as set forth in the following table.

     ITEM 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations     The following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the Company s operating results and
financial condition than can be obtained from reading the Consolidated Financial Statements alone. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included in this report. Please refer also to
our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. All dollar amounts, except share and per share data, are expressed in thousands of dollars.  
 In addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projected results, the expected interest rate environment and its impact on our business, loan yields and expected prepayments, the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses, net interest margin, expectations regarding nonperforming assets, loan growth, earning asset mix, expected cash flows from the securities portfolio and merger related expense, expectations regarding the Company s
securities portfolio, the structure and volatility of the securities portfolio and the purchase and sale of securities, their value and yields, growth in core deposits and cost, capital levels, liquidity and dividends, expectations regarding certain
large depositor relationships and the expected loss of certain large temporary deposits, the outcome of legal proceedings, loan rates and expectations regarding the impact and compression of the net interest margin, the impact of recent accounting
pronouncements, management s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions that are not historical facts, and other statements identified by words such as  expects,   anticipates,   intends,   plans, 
 believes,   should,   projects,   seeks,   estimates  or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently
subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company s control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business
strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations in the forward-looking statements, including those set forth
in this report, and our other reports filed with the SEC:      

Local and national economic conditions could be less favorable than expected or could have a more direct and pronounced effect on us than expected and adversely affect our ability to continue internal growth at
historical rates and maintain the quality of our earning assets.        

The local housing or real estate market could decline.        

The risks presented by an economic recession, which could adversely affect credit quality, collateral values, including real estate collateral, investment values, liquidity and loan originations, and loan portfolio
delinquency rates.        

Our concentration in loans to dental professionals exposes us to the risks affecting dental practices in general.        

Interest rate changes could significantly reduce net interest income and negatively affect funding sources.        

Projected business increases following any future or pending strategic expansion or opening of new branches could be lower than expected.    

Competition among financial institutions could increase significantly.        

The goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions could become impaired, which may have an adverse impact on our earnings.    

The reputation of the financial services industry could deteriorate, which could adversely affect our ability to access markets for funding and to acquire and retain customers.    

The efficiencies we may expect to receive from any investments in personnel, acquisitions, and infrastructure may not be realized.        

The level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs or changes in the estimates of future reserve requirements based upon the periodic review thereof under relevant regulatory and accounting requirements may increase.

Changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning taxes, banking, securities, executive compensation, and insurance) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.        

Acts of war or terrorism, or natural disasters, may adversely impact our business.        

The timely development and acceptance of new banking products and services and perceived overall value of these products and services by users may adversely impact our ability to increase market share and control
expenses.        

Changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting
standard setters, may impact the results of our operations.    
      47  

Table of Contents  

The costs and effects of legal, regulatory and compliance developments, including the resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory or other governmental inquiries and the results of regulatory examinations or reviews,
may adversely impact our ability to increase market share and control expenses, or may result in substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items will have a significant impact on our results of operations and future prospects.    
 Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Part I,
Item 1A  Risk Factors  in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in this report and elsewhere in this report or in our other reports with the SEC, and include risks and uncertainties
described or referred to in Part I, Item 1  Business  under the captions  Competition  and  Supervision and Regulation  in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K and Part I, Item 2  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this report. Please take into account that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to
publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     SUMMARY OF CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES     We follow accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the  FASB.  The
FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. References to GAAP issued by the FASB in this report are to the
 FASB Accounting Standards Codification,  sometimes referred to as the  Codification  or  ASC.     The SEC defines
 critical accounting policies  as those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain and may change in future periods. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. Management believes that the following policies and
those disclosed in the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K should be considered critical under the SEC definition:  
   Nonaccrual Loans      Accrual of interest is
discontinued on contractually delinquent loans when management believes that, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal or interest is
doubtful. At a minimum, loans that are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Interest income is
subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received satisfying all delinquent principal and interest amounts, and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain. In accordance with
GAAP, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance and no interest income is recognized.      Allowance for Loan Losses
and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments      The allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans is classified as a contra-asset account offsetting
outstanding loans, and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an  other  liability on the balance sheet. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings. The
balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds. The
appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments. Estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including
management s assessment of the internal risk classifications, changes in the nature of the loan portfolios, industry concentrations, and the impact of current local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.

    Troubled Debt Restructurings    
     In the normal course of business, the Company may modify the terms of certain loans, attempting to protect as much of its investment as possible.
Management evaluates the circumstances surrounding each modification to determine whether it is a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). TDRs exist when 1) the restructuring constitutes a concession, and 2) the debtor is experiencing
financial difficulties. Additional information regarding the Company s TDRs can be found in Note 4 of the      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      in Item 1 of Part I of this report.       
   Goodwill and Intangible Assets      At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $70,684 in goodwill and other intangible assets. In accordance with financial accounting standards, assets with indefinite lives are periodically tested for impairment. Management performs an impairment
analysis of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of December 31, 2015, the date the most recent analysis was performed.  
   Share-based Compensation        In accordance
with FASB ASC 718,  Stock Compensation,  we recognize expense in the income statement for the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees  requisite
service period (generally the vesting period). The requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions. The fair value of each grant is estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management assumptions
utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology, and ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the expected service period. Additional information is included in Note 9 of
the    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    in Item 1 of Part I of this report.        Fair Value Measurements
         GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements,  establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources,
while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.
Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In
such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The
Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Additional information regarding the Company s
fair value measurements can be found in Note 11 of the      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      in Item 1 of Part I of this report.       
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In May 2014, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , with an original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The core principle of this Topic is that an entity
recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In general, the new guidance
requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and
allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-14,  Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage
Loans upon Foreclosure.  ASU 2014-14 requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the following conditions are met (1) the loan has a government guarantee that is not
separable from the loan before foreclosure; (2) at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee, and the creditor has the ability to recover under
that claim; and (3) at the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed. Upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the
loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
The adoption of ASU No. 2014-14 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In September
2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are
identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this Update require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings
of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this Update require an
entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the
provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,
 Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. This ASU
requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. In addition, the
amendment requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement
category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This ASU also eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the
method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The amendment also requires a reporting organization to present
separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit ) when the organization has elected
to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The FASB is issuing this Update to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from leases. All leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, and, therefore, recognition of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents
an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-05,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815); Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships . The amendments in this Update clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative
instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of  
      50  

Table of Contents  

itself, require designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria (including those in paragraphs 815-20-35-14 through 35-18) continue to be met. ASU
2016-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
   In March 2016-06, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815); Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments .
The amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the
assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. The amendments in this Update clarify what steps are required when assessing whether the
economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative. Consequently, when a call
(put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because
they eliminate diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments. ASU 2016-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No
2016-07,  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323); Simplifying the Transition to the Equity method of accounting.  The amendments in this Update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the
equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method
had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s
previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the
investment is required. The amendments in this Update require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in
accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); Principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net).  The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update do not change the core
principle of the guidance. The amendments clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the
nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). When (or as) an entity that is
a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity
that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other
party. ASU 2016-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Improvements to employee
share-based payment accounting . The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the specific changes associated with the update include all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) being
recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits
regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures
when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The core principle of the guidance in this update is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of

 On September 6, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Foundation Bank. Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, during October 2016, the
Company successfully converted the Foundation Bank core systems to the Company s core operating system. A summary of the assets and liabilities acquired through this transaction is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report.    The Company earned $4,851, or $0.23 per diluted share, in third quarter 2016, compared to $5,325, or
$0.27 per diluted share, in third quarter 2015. Included in third quarter income was $1,767 of merger related expense associated with the acquisition, which lowered third quarter 2016 net income by $1,149, or approximately $0.06 per share.  
 The Company recognized provision for loan losses of $1,380 in the third quarter 2016, representing an increase of $755 over third quarter 2015. The Company
also saw net interest income grow $2,463 to $20,771 in the third quarter 2016, up from $18,308 in the third quarter 2015. Income growth was primarily attributable to growth in the loan portfolio associated with the acquired loans and organic loan
growth experienced during the quarter.    During the third quarter 2016, the Company continued to experience growth in outstanding loans. Outstanding loans
at September 30, 2016, were $1,808,646, up $402,634 over December 31, 2015, outstanding loans. Included in the growth was $270,533 in net loans acquired through the Foundation Bank acquisition. Excluding the acquired loans, the Company
grew organic loans $132,101 since the prior year end, representing an annualized growth rate of 12.55% and expansion in all core lending segments, including construction loans, real estate loans and commercial loans.

  Outstanding core deposits at September 30, 2016, were $2,049,352, which represented growth of $515,410,
since December 31, 2015. Included in the growth was $396,509 of deposits acquired through the Foundation Bank acquisition. Excluding acquired deposits, the Company experienced organic deposit growth of $118,901 since the prior year end,
representing an annualized growth rate of 10.35%. Included in period end core deposits was a large temporary deposit of approximately $60,000, which was deposited toward the end of the quarter in conjunction with the sale of a client. The funds are
temporary in nature and are expected to leave prior to the end of 2016.     Reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial information   
 Management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures to monitor the Company s performance. While we believe the presentation of non-GAAP financial
measures provides additional insight into our operating performance, readers of this report are urged to review the GAAP results as presented in the Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report.  
 The Company presents a computation of tangible equity along with tangible book value and return on average tangible equity. The Company defines tangible
equity as total shareholders  equity before goodwill and core deposit intangible assets. Tangible book value is calculated as tangible equity divided by total shares outstanding. Return on average tangible equity is calculated as net income
divided by average tangible equity. We believe that tangible equity and certain tangible equity ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy which may be used when making period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. Tangible equity and
tangible equity ratios are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders  equity, book value and return on average equity. The following table presents a reconciliation of total
shareholders  equity to tangible equity.      
   The Company presents a computation of core net interest margin and adjusted net interest income, which exclude prepayment
penalties on loans, prepayment penalties on brokered deposits, and accretion of fair value marks, for third quarter 2016, second quarter 2016, and third quarter 2015. Core net interest margin and adjusted net interest income are considered non-GAAP
financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with the consolidated statement of income and average balance analysis of net interest income. The following table presents a reconciliation of net interest margin to core net interest margin.

   Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Interest Income to Net Interest Income   

Non-GAAP
financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have
limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.     RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS      Net Interest Income     Net interest
income is the primary source of the Company s revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets, principally loans, and interest expense associated with interest-bearing liabilities, principally
deposits. The volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources, market rates of interest, demand for loans, and the availability of deposits affect net interest income.  
 Net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets for third quarter 2016 was 4.22%, representing reductions of 5 basis points and 9 basis points
from second quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015, respectively. The linked-quarter margin contracted primarily due to the higher cost of interest bearing wholesale funding, reflecting the increased interest expense on the subordinated debentures
issued at the end of June 2016. During third quarter 2016, accretion of loan fair value discounts and other items was $1,153 and added 23 basis points to the net interest margin, compared to loan fair value accretion and other nonrecurring items of
$322 in second quarter 2016 that added 7 basis points to the net interest margin. The increase in accretion income is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Foundation Bank, which was completed on September 6, 2016.  
 The Company also saw a reduction in yields on the taxable portion of the loan portfolio, as new loans were being booked at rates below the current portfolio
yield, which are expected to continue to place downward pressure on the net interest margin.  
      55  

Table of Contents  

  The decrease in the year-over-year net interest margin of 9 basis point was primarily due to a reduction in
nonrecurring interest items, primarily accretion income booked on the acquired loan portfolios and the increase in interest expense on the Notes. Prior to issuance of the Notes in the second quarter, the core net interest margin, which removes the
effect of fair value accretion and nonrecurring items, remained relatively stable due to a continued shift in earning asset mix as higher yielding loans represented a larger proportion of total earning assets versus the lower yielding securities
portfolio. With the increase in the additional interest expense on the Notes, the core margin is expected to experience some margin compression in future quarters. Core net interest margin is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. See
 Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information  above.

  Table I shows that earning asset yields in third quarter 2016 were 4.59%, down 2 basis points from the 4.57%
recorded in third quarter 2015. The Bank experienced a decrease in yield on the taxable loan portfolio of 4 basis points when compared to the prior period. New loans continued to be booked at rates lower than the average portfolio rate, which
continued to slowly reduce the overall portfolio yield; however, an increase in accretion income attributable to the acquired loan portfolios partially offseting that decline. The increase in the yield on the taxable portion of the securities
portfolio reflected more recent purchases, which were longer in nature, resulting in an increase in yield.    The cost of interest-bearing liabilities
increased by 20 basis points from 0.41% in third quarter 2015 compared to 0.61% in third quarter 2016. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the issuance of the Debentures in the second quarter, which have a
stated coupon rate of 5.875%. The rates paid on interest-bearing core deposits increased by 1 basis point, due to a change in the depositor composition of the core deposits.

 The third quarter 2016 rate/volume analysis shows that net interest income increased by $2,608 over third quarter 2015. Interest income increased $3,356,
while interest expense increased $748. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher volumes, which generated an additional $3,313 in interest income, which was partially offset by a decline in interest income of $43 due to lower
rates.

   Loan Loss Provision and Allowance   
 Below is a summary of the Company s allowance for loan losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015:  
   
   The Company recorded $1,380 in provision for loan losses during the third quarter 2016, which was attributable to growth in
the loan portfolio and the downgrade of a dental loan relationship totaling $1,661. The Company s classified assets at September 30, 2016, were 23.80% of regulatory capital, compared to 23.03% and 25.14% of regulatory capital at
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Classified assets totaled $56,166, at September 30, 2016, up $13,337 from June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Foundation Bank, which
as of September 30, 2016, added $19,233 to the classified assets totals.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net
charge offs of $369, or annualized 0.05% of average outstanding loans, compared to net charge offs of $200, or 0.03% of average loans, for the same period in 2015. The allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans at September 30, 2016, was
$20,531, or 1.14% of outstanding loans, compared to 1.23% and 1.23% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of total loans was primarily attributable to
loans acquired through acquisition, which were booked net of their credit related fair value adjustment and were only included in the allowance for loan losses to the extent their credit impairment exceeded the remaining credit related fair value
discount. As these loans mature or are refinanced into the non-acquired loan portfolio, they are included in the allowance for loan losses, therefore increasing the allowance as a percentage of total loans. At September 30, 2016, the Company
had a total of $9,999 of credit related fair value adjustment assigned to acquired loans. The balance of these acquired loans totaled $439,178, before the credit and interest rate fair value adjustments. When acquired loans with an assigned credit
fair value mark are excluded from outstanding loans, the allowance for loan losses of $20,531 as a percentage of organic loans outstanding was 1.48% as of September 30, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans, net of
government guarantees, was 210.23% at September 30, 2016, compared to 636.30% and 744.60% at December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
 At September 30, 2016, $9,551 of loans (net of government guarantees) were classified as impaired. A specific allowance of $738 (included in the ending
allowance at September 30, 2016) was assigned to these loans. That compares to impaired loans of $7,527 (net of government guarantees) and a specific allowance assigned of $175 at December 31, 2015.  
 Total nonperforming assets, net of government guarantees, were $22,832, or 0.90% of total assets, at September 30, 2016, up $8,366 from December 31,
2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Foundation Bank. At September 30, 2016, nonperforming assets consisted of $9,766 in nonaccrual loans (net of government guarantees), no loans were 90 days past due and still accruing interest, and there
was $13,066 of other real estate owned.

 Consolidated classified asset ratio is defined as the sum of all loan-related contingent liabilities and loans internally graded substandard or worse (net of government guarantees), adversely classified securities, and
other real estate owned, divided by total consolidated Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses.      Other real estate owned at
September 30, 2016, consisted of ten properties. One of the properties, a commercial land development project valued at $9,839, comprised 75.30% of the total other real estate owned category. The Company has been actively marketing this
property; however, the location and nature of the commercial land development property make it susceptible to possible future valuation write-downs as it is appraised on an annual basis.

   Noninterest Income       
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income was $1,919, up $205 from the same period last year. The
increase in the quarter to date noninterest income through September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period last year, was primarily due to a one-time payment of $160 from the SBA for reimbursement of legal and collection fees incurred by
Capital Pacific Bank, prior to that acquisition.     Noninterest Expense       
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $13,825, representing an increase of $2,643 or
23.64% over the prior year. Included in the current period total is merger expense related to the acquisition of Foundation Bank, totaling $1,767. Excluding merger related expenses, non-interest expense increased $876, or 7.83%. After merger related
expense, the next largest increase was related to salaries and employee benefits expense, which increased $698 or 10.23%. The increase was due to the full year of salary expense from the Capital Pacific acquisition, which closed in March 2015,
salary expense related to the retained Foundation Bank employees, which was included in Pacific Continental s salary expense beginning September 7, 2016, and overall performance increases.  
 In fourth quarter 2016, the Company anticipates additional merger related expenses due to the core systems conversion and associated retention bonuses and
severance payments not occurring until October 2016.

   BALANCE SHEET   
  Loans     A summary of outstanding loans by market at
September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, follows:      
   The Bank recorded loan growth of $322,543 during the third quarter 2016, which included loans acquired in the Foundation Bank
acquisition of $270,533, which are reflected in the Puget Sound Market totals. Portland lending accelerated in third quarter 2016, increasing $31,085 from June 30, 2016. The Company s overall loan growth during the third quarter 2016
occurred across several loan types, including owner-occupied commercial real estate, non-owner occupied commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans.  
   Outstanding loans to dental professionals, which are comprised of both local and national loans, at September 30, 2016, totaled $370,135 or 20.46%
of the loan portfolio, compared to $340,162 or 24.19% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. The Company s national dental loans increased by $24,892 from December 31, 2015 and were represented in 43 states by the end of the
third quarter 2016. In addition to national growth, the Company saw growth in the local dental market, with the portfolio growing $5,081 from year-end 2015, which was primarily due to a slowdown of prepayments and an increase in production in the
Company s Portland market local lending. At September 30, 2016, $6,852 or 1.85% of the outstanding dental loans were supported by government guarantees. Loans to dental professionals include loans for such purposes as starting up a
practice, acquisition of a practice, equipment financing, financing owner-occupied facilities, and working capital. National dental loans are limited only to acquisition of a seasoned practice by experienced dental professionals, practice refinances
and owner-occupied real estate loans. Additional data on the Company s dental loan portfolio and the credit quality of this portfolio can be found in Note 5 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in this report .   
 All loans to related parties were made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as
those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Company.        Detailed credit quality data on the entire loan
portfolio can be found in Note 4 of the      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      in this report.       
  Securities     At September 30, 2016, the balance of
securities available-for-sale was $482,408, up $115,810 over December 31, 2015. The growth in the portfolio was partially attributable to securities acquired in the Foundation Bank acquisition of $88,331. At September 30, 2016, the
portfolio had an unrealized pre-tax gain of $9,450, compared to an unrealized pre-tax gain of $4,341, at December 31, 2015. The average life and duration of the portfolio at September 30, 2016, was 4.7 years and 4.3 years, respectively. At
September 30, 2016, $28,391 of the securities portfolio was pledged as collateral for public deposits in Oregon and Washington and for repurchase agreements.  
 During the third quarter 2016, the Company sold approximately $55,000 in securities acquired from Foundation Bank, and replaced the securities with new
purchases. This transaction had minimal impact on the average life of the portfolio, however, the sold securities had a weighted average yield of approximately 1.64% and were replaced with securities yielding 1.98%. The Company expects to benefit
from the increased yield in future quarters.

  The Company continued to structure the portfolio to provide consistent cash flow and reduce the market value
volatility of the portfolio in a rising rate environment in light of the Company s current liability sensitive position. The portfolio is structured to generate sufficient cash flow to allow reinvestment at higher rates should interest rates
move up or to fund loan growth in future periods. In a stable rate environment, approximately $56,395 in cash flow from the securities portfolio is anticipated over the next twelve months. Going forward, purchases will be dependent upon core deposit
growth, loan growth, and the Company s interest rate risk position, with the Company targeting securities between 19% and 20% of total assets.    At
September 30, 2016, $2,110, or 0.44% of the total securities portfolio, was composed of private-label mortgage-backed securities. Management previously booked OTTI on this portion of the portfolio totaling $266, with $2 of additional OTTI
booked in third quarter 2016. On a monthly basis, Management reviews all available information, including current and projected default rates and current and projected loss severities, related to the collectability of its potentially impaired
investment securities to determine if an additional OTTI is required. Recognition of additional OTTI on the private-label mortgage-backed portion of the portfolio is possible in future quarters depending upon economic conditions, default rates on
home mortgages, loss severities on foreclosed homes, unemployment levels, and home values.    In management s opinion, the remaining securities in the
portfolio in an unrealized loss position were considered only temporarily impaired at the quarter ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no intent, nor was it more likely than not that it would be required, to
sell its impaired securities before their recovery. The impairment was due to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of the securities, and not due to concerns regarding the underlying
credit of the issuers or the underlying collateral. The decline in value of these securities resulted from current economic conditions. Although yields on these securities may be below market rates during the period, no loss of principal was
expected at September 30, 2016.     Goodwill and Intangible Assets   
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had the following goodwill and core deposit intangibles ( CDI ) associated with prior bank acquisitions:  
   
   The Company periodically tests goodwill for impairment. Management performs an impairment analysis of the intangible assets
with indefinite lives at least annually, but more frequently if an impairment triggering event is deemed to have occurred. The last impairment test was performed at December 31, 2015, at which time no impairment was determined to exist.  
 The CDI for Foundation Bank was determined to have an expected life of 10 years, and is being amortized over that period using a straight-line method and will
be fully amortized in August 2026. The CDI for Capital Pacific Bank was determined to have an expected life of ten years, and is being amortized over that period using the straight-line method and will be fully amortized in February 2025. The CDI
for Century Bank was determined to have an expected life of seven years, and is being amortized over that period using the straight-line method and will be fully amortized in January 2020.

   Deposits   
 Core deposits, which are defined by the Company as demand, interest checking, money market, savings, and nonpublic local time deposits, including nonpublic
local time deposits in excess of $100, were $2,049,352 and represented 94.76% of total deposits at September 30, 2016. During the third quarter the Company experienced growth in core deposits of $541,333. The increase, was partially
attributable to the Foundation Bank acquisition of $396,509 and the remaining increase was due to organic deposit growth of $144,924.    A key component of
core deposits is noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which totaled $901,290 and represented 43.98% of core deposits at September 30, 2016. The weighted average cost of core deposits, when factoring in non-interest bearing core deposits, for
the third quarter 2016 was 0.15%.    A summary of outstanding core deposits and average core deposits by market and wholesale funding classified as non-core
deposits at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, follows:

   Other Deposits   
 The Company uses public and brokered deposits to provide short-term and long-term funding sources. The Company defines short-term as having a contractual
maturity of less than one year. The Company uses brokered deposits to help mitigate interest rate risk in a rising rate environment.    Below is a schedule
detailing public and brokered deposits by type, including weighted average rate and weighted average maturity.     Non-Core Deposit Summary
      
    Borrowings     The Company
has both secured and unsecured borrowing lines with the FHLB, FRB and various correspondent banks. The Federal Reserve and correspondent borrowings are generally short-term, with a maturity of less than 30 days. The FHLB borrowings can be either
short-term or long-term in nature. See Note 7 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a full maturity and interest rate schedule for the FHLB borrowings.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company held $4,653 of stock in the FHLB of Des Moines, which included $532 in FHLB stock acquired through the Foundation Bank
acquisition. The FHLB stock is broken into two classes: membership and activity. The membership class is based on asset size and the holder is required to be a member of the FHLB. The amount of membership stock held at September 30, 2016 was
$2,823 and is updated in the first quarter of each year. The activity stock outstanding at September 30, 2016 totaled $1,820; however, it is subject to fluctuation on a daily basis based on outstanding borrowings. At September 30, 2016,
membership stock paid dividends at 0.50% annually and activity stock paid dividends at 3.50% annually. Both classes of FHLB stock are listed in the asset section of the Company s balance sheet.  
  Subordinated Debentures     In June 2016, the Company issued
$35,000 in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures (the  Notes ). The Notes have a fixed annual rate for a five-year period at 5.875%. After five years, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an
annual interest rate equal to the then-current three-month LIBOR plus 471.5 basis points. The Notes are included in Tier 2 capital under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations.  
  Junior Subordinated Debentures     On September 6,
2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Foundation Bancorp. At that time, the Company assumed $6,148 of junior subordinated debentures (the  Foundation Debentures ), with a fair value on acquisition date of $3,013. The interest rate
on the Foundation Debentures is a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 173 basis points. The $6,000 of the Foundation Debentures qualifies as Tier 1 capital under regulatory capital guidelines.

  The Company had $8,248 in Debentures outstanding at September 30, 2016, which were issued in conjunction
with the 2005 acquisition of Northwest Business Bank. The Debentures had an interest rate of 6.265% that was fixed until January 2011, after which the rate changed to three-month LIBOR plus 135 basis points. On April 22, 2013, the Bank entered
into a cash flow hedge on $8,000 of the TPS, swapping the variable interest rate for a fixed rate of 2.73% for approximately seven years. At September 30, 2016, the fair value of the interest rate swap on the Company s Debentures was
($82). The $8,000 of junior subordinated debentures qualifies as Tier 1 capital under regulatory capital guidelines.    In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ) was signed into law which, among other things, limits the ability of certain bank holding companies to treat trust preferred security debt issuances, such as the Company s
junior subordinated debentures, as Tier 1 capital. Under final rules adopted by the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. Federal banking agencies, our trust preferred securities will remain as Tier 1 capital since total assets of the Company are less
than $15 billion. Additional information regarding these final capital rules is included in Part I, Item 2,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Capital Resources  
of this report and in Part II, Item 1A   Risk Factors   of our 2015 Form 10-K under the heading  We operate in a highly regulated environment and the effects of recent and pending federal legislation or of changes in, or
supervisory enforcement of, banking or other laws and regulations could adversely affect us.       Additional information regarding the terms of
the cash flow hedge is included in Note 10 of the    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    in Part I, Item 1 of this report.    
  Capital Resources     Capital is the shareholders 
investment in the Company. Capital grows through the retention of earnings and the issuance of new stock or other equity securities whether through stock offerings or through the exercise of equity awards. Capital formation allows the Company to
grow assets and provides flexibility in times of adversity. Shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016, was $276,471, up $57,980 from December 31, 2015. The increase in shareholders  equity was primarily due to stock issued
through the Foundation Bank acquisition of $47,794, in addition to an increase in the unrealized gain on the investment portion combined with retention of a portion of income earned during 2016.  
 In June 2016, the Company issued $35,000 in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures (the  Notes ). The Notes
are included in Tier 2 capital under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations. In third quarter 2016, the Company made a capital investment in the Bank totaling $20,000, which qualifies as Tier 1 capital under current regulatory guidelines
and interpretations.    The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have in place guidelines for risk-based capital requirements applicable to U.S. bank holding
companies and banks. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules making significant changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and to conform this
framework to the Basel Committee s current international regulatory capital accord (Basel III). These rules were effective January 1, 2015 and replaced the federal banking agencies  general risk-based capital rules, advanced
approaches rule, market-risk rule, and leverage rules, in accordance with certain transition provisions. The rules establish more restrictive capital definitions, create additional categories and higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes and
off-balance sheet exposures, higher leverage ratios and a capital conservation buffer that will be added to the minimum capital requirements and must be met for banking organizations to avoid being subject to certain limitations on dividends and
discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The rules also implement higher minimum capital requirements, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet in order to be
considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. When fully phased in, the final rules will provide for increased minimum capital ratios as follows: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50%;
(b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00% (an increase from 4.00%); (c) a total capital ratio of 8.00%; and (d) a Tier 1 leverage ratio to average consolidated assets of 4.00%. The new rules permit depository institution holding companies
with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, to include trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital. Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions,
including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements
(equal to 2.50% of total risk-weighted assets). The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer began January 1, 2016, and will be completed by January 1, 2019. The new rules also provide for various adjustments and deductions to the
definitions of regulatory capital that will phase in from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017. The new rules made it optional for banks and bank holding companies to include accumulated other comprehensive income in their calculations of
Tier 1 capital. The Company s accumulated other comprehensive income consists primarily of the unrealized gain or loss on the securities portfolio as a result of marking securities available-for-sale to market. The Company opted to exclude
accumulated other comprehensive income from its calculation of Tier 1 capital. Overall, the new rules did not materially impact the Company s reported capital ratios. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the rules as they are
phased in over the next few years.

  The Company s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, total risk based capital
ratio, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio were 9.43%, 9.99%, 12.55% and 10.33%, respectively, at September 30, 2016, with all capital ratios for the Company above the minimum regulatory designations. For additional information regarding the
Company s regulatory capital levels, see Note 12 in  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part I, Item I of this report.    The Company
has regularly paid cash dividends on a quarterly basis, typically in February, May, August and November of each year. The Board of Directors considers the dividend amount quarterly and takes a broad perspective in its dividend deliberations
including a review of recent operating performance, capital levels, concentrations of loans as a percentage of capital, and growth projections. The Board also considers dividend payout ratios, dividend yield, and other financial metrics in setting
the quarterly dividend. There can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future.    On July 20, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a
regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.11 that was paid on August 18, 2016. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter 2016, on October 18, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share
payable to shareholders on November 23, 2016.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS   
 In the normal course of business, the Company commits to extensions of credit and issues letters of credit. The Company uses the same credit policies in making
commitments to lend funds and conditional obligations as it does for other credit products. In the event of nonperformance by the customer, the Company s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract. Since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $408,639 in commitments to extend credit, up from $256,156 at December 31, 2015.  
 Letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved
is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $1,393 in letters of credit and financial guarantees outstanding.  
  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS     Liquidity is the term used to
define the Company s ability to meet its financial commitments. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds. The Company derives liquidity through core
deposit growth, maturity of investment securities, and loan payments. Core deposits include demand, interest checking, money market, savings, and local time deposits, including local nonpublic time deposits in excess of $100. Additional liquidity
and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans, sales of securities, access to national CD markets, and both secured and unsecured borrowings. The Company uses a number of measurements to monitor its liquidity position on a daily,
weekly, and monthly basis, which includes its ability to meet both short-term and long-term obligations, and requires the Company to maintain a certain amount of liquidity on the asset side of its balance sheet. The Company also prepares projections
of its liquidity position. In addition, the Company has a Liquidity Funding Policy ( LFP ) that is reviewed and approved annually by the Company s Asset and Liability Committee and the Board of Directors. Included in the LFP is a
contingency funding plan based on both a short-term and long-term cash flow analysis, which are reviewed periodically by ALCO.    Core deposits at
September 30, 2016, were $2,049,352 and represented 94.76% of total deposits. Core deposits at September 30, 2016, were up $515,410 from December 31, 2015. During the same time period, the Company experienced an increase in
outstanding loans of $402,634. The liability growth was partially offset by a decrease in FHLB borrowing. It is anticipated that cash flows from the securities portfolio and additional non-core funding sources will provide an additional portion of
the funding during the remainder of 2016, as loans are expected to continue to increase. The securities portfolio represented 19.00% of total assets at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $28,391 of the securities portfolio was
pledged to support public deposits and repurchase agreements, leaving $454,017 of the securities portfolio unencumbered and available-for-sale. In addition, at September 30, 2016, the Company had $26,619 of government guaranteed loans that
could be sold in the secondary market to support the Company s liquidity position.

  Due to its strategic focus to market to specific segments, the Company has been successful in developing deposit
relationships with several large clients, which are generally defined as deposit relationships of $2,000 or more, which are closely monitored by management. The loss of any such deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause
an adverse effect on short-term liquidity. The Company uses a 10-point risk-rating system to evaluate each of its large depositors in order to assist management in its daily monitoring of the volatility of this portion of its core deposit base. The
risk-rating system attempts to determine the stability of the deposits of each large depositor, evaluating, among other things, the length of time the depositor has been with the Company and the likelihood of loss of individual large depositor
relationships. Risk ratings on large depositors are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted if necessary. Company management maintain close relationships and hold regular meetings with its large depositors to assist in management of these
relationships.    During the quarter, the Company experienced an increase in core deposits, attributed to the Foundation Bank acquisition, and growth in the
organic core deposit base. At September 30, 2016, in addition to the temporary deposit of $60,000 mentioned previously, the Bank had approximately $66,000 in additional risk rated 10 deposits, the highest risk rating. Currently, the
Company anticipates that these funds will leave the Bank by December 31, 2016. The Company continues to review and implement its funding strategy to offset deposit reductions. The Company currently maintains sufficient short-term
liquidity to cover any potential volatility in the large depositor base. However, there can be no assurance that any of our other large depositor relationships will be maintained or that the loss of one or more of these clients will not
adversely affect the Company s liquidity.    At September 30, 2016, the Company had secured borrowing lines with the FHLB of Des Moines and the
FRB, along with unsecured borrowing lines with various correspondent banks, totaling $813,630. The Company s secured lines with the FHLB and FRB were limited by the amount of collateral pledged. At September 30, 2016, the Company had
pledged $602,715 in discounted collateral value in commercial real estate loans, first and third lien single-family residential loans, multi-family loans, and securities to the FHLB. Additionally, certain commercial and commercial real estate loans
with a discounted value of $81,915 were pledged to the FRB under the Company s Borrower-In-Custody program. The Company s unsecured correspondent bank lines totaled $129,000. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $45,500 in
borrowings outstanding from the FHLB, no borrowings outstanding with the FRB, and no borrowings on its overnight correspondent bank lines, leaving a total of $768,130 available on its secured and unsecured borrowing lines as of such date.  
   Net cash provided by operating activities was $19,957 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the same period, cash of $114,903
was used in investing activities, consisting principally of a net loan principal increase of $133,405 and net purchases of securities of $25,624. Cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2016 was $165,443 and primarily
consisted of an increase in borrowings and cash related to the Notes issuance. Additional information on the Company cash flows can be reviewed in the    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows    in Part I, Item 1 of this
report.         ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 There has been no material change in the Company s exposure to market risk. Readers are referred to the Company s 2015 Form 10-K and the Annual
Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015, for additional information.       ITEM 4 Controls and
Procedures       Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  . We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure
controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
   Changes in internal control over financial reporting  . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  
    PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
    ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings   
 On August 23, 2013, a putative class action lawsuit ( Class Action ) was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of
Multnomah on behalf of individuals who placed money with Berjac of Oregon and Berjac of Portland (collectively,  Berjac ). The Berjac entities merged and the surviving company, Berjac of Oregon, is currently in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The
Class Action complaint, which has been amended several times, currently asserts three claims against Pacific Continental Bank, Fred  Jack  W. Holcomb, Holcomb Family Limited Partnership, Jones   Roth, P.C., and Umpqua Bank, as
defendants. The lawsuit asserts that the Bank is jointly and severally liable for materially aiding or participating in Berjac s sales of securities in violation of the Oregon Securities Law. Claimants seek the return of the money placed with
Berjac of Oregon and Berjac of Portland, plus interest, and costs and attorneys  fees. The current version of the complaint seeks $100 million in damages from all defendants.  
 On August 28, 2014, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for Berjac of Oregon filed an adversary complaint (Trustee s Lawsuit) in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon alleging that the Company, the Bank, Umpqua Bank, Century Bank and Summit Bank provided lines of credit that enabled continuation of the alleged Ponzi scheme operated by Berjac of Oregon and the two
partners of the pre-existing Berjac general partnerships, Michael Holcomb and Gary Holcomb. The Company acquired Century Bank on February 1, 2013. The Trustee s Lawsuit was transferred from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to the U.S. District
Court for the District of Oregon (Eugene Division), where it is currently pending.    In addition to seeking an award of punitive damages, the trustee is
asserting fraudulent transfer law and unjust enrichment in an effort to recover payments made by Berjac to Century Bank and the Bank. Among other claims for relief, the trustee is seeking the disgorgement of monies advanced to the Holcomb Family
Limited Partnership by Century Bank and returned to the estate by court order following the post-petition cash collateral hearing, and of monies received by the Bank from the proceeds of the sale of stock held by the Holcomb Family Limited
Partnership and securing one of the lines of credit previously held by Century Bank. The trustee also asserts a claim for alleged aiding and abetting of breaches of duties owed to Berjac. The complaint in the Trustee s Lawsuit indicates the
range of damages sought by the trustee which include, among other claims for relief, an award of punitive damages not to exceed $10 million, recovery of payments associated with allegedly fraudulent transfers totaling up to approximately $55.3
million, including up to $20.7 million from Century Bank and up to $7.7 million from the Bank. This case is not currently set for trial.    On
November 16, 2015, the U.S. District Court judge stayed all deadlines in the Trustee s Lawsuit and all parties were ordered to participate in a judicial settlement conference. The judicial settlement conference sessions were held on
February 18, 2016 and April 20, 2016. At the April 20, 2016, settlement conference, the Bank reached a tentative settlement of the Class Action and the Trustee s Lawsuit. The settlement of the Class Action will require approval
of the Circuit Court judge. The settlement is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition.    We may from time
to time be involved in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from our business and property ownership. Based on currently available information, the Company does not expect that the results of such proceedings, including the above-described
proceeding, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

    Industry Factors    
  Fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profitability.   
 As is the case with many banks, our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest
earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could
adversely affect, and has in past years, impacted, our net interest margin, and, in turn, our profitability. This impact could result in a decrease in our interest income relative to interest expense. Increases in interest rates may also adversely
impact the value of our securities investment portfolio. At September 30, 2016, our balance sheet was liability sensitive, and an increase in interest rates could cause our net interest margin and our net interest income to decline. Since the
financial crisis of 2008, the banking industry has operated in an extremely low interest rate environment relative to historical averages, and the Federal Reserve has pursued highly accommodative monetary policies (including a very low Federal funds
rate and substantial purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury and agency securities) in an effort to facilitate growth in the U.S. economy and a reduction in levels of unemployment. This environment has placed downward pressure on the net interest
margins of U.S. banks, including the Bank. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate from 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Federal Reserve further indicated future policy actions to normalize interest rates will
depend upon progress towards its objectives of maximum employment and two percent inflation, although the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, and, even after employment and inflation are near its objectives, economic conditions may
warrant for some time keeping the target federal funds rate below longer-term normal levels. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it intended to continue its policy of holding longer-term agency and Treasury securities at sizeable levels to help
maintain accommodative financial conditions. In September 2016, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at   1   4  to   1   2  percent, noting that, while the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened, it decided to wait for further evidence of continued progress
towards its objectives. The degree to which the Federal Reserve will continue its accommodative monetary policies, and the timing of any easing of those policies, will depend upon the Federal Reserve s judgments regarding labor market
conditions and the overall economic outlook, and are, therefore, subject to continuing uncertainty.      Company Factors    
  We have a significant concentration in loans to dental professionals, and loan concentrations within one industry may create additional risk.   
 Bank regulatory authorities and investors generally view significant loan concentrations within any particular industry as carrying higher inherent risk than
a loan portfolio without any significant concentration in one industry. We have a significant concentration of loans to dental professionals which represented 20.46% in principal amount of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 (see
Note 5 in the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this Form 10-Q). While we apply credit practices which we believe to be prudent to these loans as well as all the other loans in our portfolio, due to our concentration in
dental lending, we are exposed to the general risks of industry concentration, which include adverse market factors impacting that industry alone or disproportionately to other industries. In addition, bank regulatory authorities may in the future
require us to limit additional lending in the dental industry if they have concerns that our concentration in that industry creates significant risks, which in turn could limit our ability to pursue new loans in an area where we believe we currently
have a competitive advantage.  
      74  

Table of Contents  

   Nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.     At September 30, 2016, our nonperforming loans (which include all nonaccrual loans, net of government guarantees) were
0.54% of the loan portfolio. At September 30, 2016, our nonperforming assets (which include foreclosed real estate) were 0.90% of total assets. Nonperforming loans and assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. Until economic and
market conditions improve, we expect to continue to incur losses relating to nonperforming assets. We generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing
our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, less estimated selling expenses, which may ultimately result
in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we reduce problem assets through loan sales,
workouts, and restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers  performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the
performance of their other responsibilities. Any significant future increase in nonperforming assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
  We may not have the ability to continue paying dividends on our common stock at current or historic levels.   
 On October 26, 2016, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable to shareholders on November 23, 2016. Our ability to pay
dividends on our common stock depends on a variety of factors. It is possible in the future that we may not be able to continue paying quarterly dividends commensurate with historic levels, if at all. As a holding company, a substantial portion of
our cash flow typically comes from dividends our bank subsidiary pays to us. Cash dividends will depend on sufficient earnings to support them and adherence to bank regulatory requirements. If the Bank is not able to pay dividends to the Company,
the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  
  We may be required, in the future, to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the FHLB stock we hold.   
 Our securities portfolio contains whole loan private mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities and currently includes securities with unrecognized
losses. We may continue to observe volatility in the fair market value of these securities. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other than temporary impairment ( OTTI ) each reporting period, as required by GAAP. Future
evaluations of the securities portfolio could require us to recognize impairment charges. The credit quality of securities issued by certain municipalities has deteriorated in recent quarters. Although management does not believe the credit quality
of the Company s municipal securities has similarly deteriorated, such deterioration could occur in the future. For example, it is possible that government-sponsored programs to allow mortgages to be refinanced to lower rates could materially
adversely impact the yield on our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is composed of such securities.  
 In addition, as a condition to membership in the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock, based on our asset size, which is
assessed annually. In addition to asset based stock holding, stock is also held to support the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, we had stock in the FHLB totaling $4,643. The FHLB stock held by us
is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. As of September 30, 2016, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB stock holdings. Future negative changes to the financial
condition of the FHLB could require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings.

   If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have an adverse
impact on our reported earnings.     At September 30, 2016, we had $61,434 of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with GAAP,
our goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such evaluation is based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative
factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events. The last impairment test was performed at December 31, 2015. At
December 31, 2015, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our goodwill. Future evaluations of goodwill may result.

there are any accrued but unpaid dividends on the preferred shares, there will be no distribution to or on behalf of the common shares, either by way of dividend, purchase thereof by the corporation, or otherwise.

amount determined by the Board of Directors for the applicable series and no more in priority to payment on the common shares.

the relative rights and preferences thereof. Any such resolution or resolutions will be adopted by the Board of Directors before any shares of that series are issued. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, increase the number of preferred
shares of any then existing series by making all unissued preferred shares a part of such series. The Board of Directors may decrease (but not below the number of such shares then outstanding) the number of preferred shares of any then existing
series by requiring that all unissued shares previously assigned to such series will no longer constitute a part thereof. The Board of Directors is hereby empowered to classify or reclassify any unissued preferred shares by fixing or altering the

 FAIR PRICE PROVISION    . For purposes of this Article:  
 An interested shareholder transaction means any transaction between a corporation, or any subsidiary thereof, and an interested shareholder of such
corporation or an affiliated person to an interested shareholder, that must be authorized pursuant to applicable law by a vote of the shareholders.    An
interested shareholder:        Includes any person
or group of affiliated persons who beneficially own twenty percent or more of the outstanding voting shares of a corporation. An affiliated person is any person who either acts jointly or in concert with, or directly or indirectly controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with another person; and    Excludes any person who, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this
Article, is an agent, custodial bank, broker, nominee, or trustee for another person, if such other person is not an interested shareholder under Section 1(b)(1) of this Article.  
 . Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article, an interested shareholder transaction must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds
of the shares entitled to be counted under this Section 2, or if any class of shares is entitled to vote thereon as a class, then by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shares of each class entitled to be counted under this Section 2 and of
the total shares entitled to be counted under this Section 2. All outstanding shares entitled to vote under applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation will be entitled to be counted under this Section 2, except shares owned by or voted
under the control of an interested shareholder may not be counted to determine whether shareholders have approved a transaction for purposes of this Section 2. The vote of the shares owned by or voted under the control of an interested
shareholder, however, will be counted in determining whether a transaction is approved under other provisions of applicable law and for purposes of determining a quorum.  
 . This Article will not apply to a transaction:    Approved by a
majority vote of the board of directors. For such purpose, the vote of directors whose votes are otherwise entitled to be counted under the Articles of Incorporation and applicable law who are directors or officers of, or have a material financial
interest in, an interested shareholder, or who were nominated for election as a director as a result of an arrangement with an interested shareholder and first elected as a director within twenty-four months of the proposed transaction, will not be
counted in determining whether the transaction is approved by such directors; or      

In which a majority of directors whose votes are entitled to be counted under Section 3(a) determines that the
fair market value of the consideration to be received by noninterested shareholders for shares of any class of which shares are owned by any interested shareholder is not less than the highest fair market value of the consideration paid by any
interested shareholder in acquiring shares of the same class within twenty-four months of the proposed transaction.      
 . This Article may be amended or repealed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares entitled to be counted under this
Section 4. All outstanding shares entitled to vote under applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation will be entitled to be counted under this Section 4, except shares owned by or voted under the control of an interested shareholder may not
be counted to determine whether shareholders have voted to approve the amendment or repeal. The vote of the shares owned by or voted under the control of an interested shareholder, however, will be counted in determining whether the amendment
or repeal is approved under other provisions of applicable law and for purposes of determining a quorum.    . The requirements imposed by this Article
are to be in addition to, and not in lieu of, requirements imposed on any transaction by any provision of applicable law, or any other provision of the Articles of Incorporation, or the Bylaws or otherwise.  
  CONSIDERATION OF NON-MONETARY FACTORS   
 The Board of Directors of the corporation, when evaluating any offer of another party to (a) make a tender or exchange offer for any
equity security of the corporation, (b) merge or consolidate the corporation with another corporation, or (c) purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the corporation, will, in connection with
the exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including without limitation the social and economic effects on the employees,
customers, suppliers, and other constituents of the corporation and its subsidiaries and on the communities in which the corporation and its subsidiaries operate or are located.  
  BOARD OF DIRECTORS     . The Board of Directors will consist
of not fewer than six individuals. The exact number will be fixed by the Bylaws and may be changed from time to time in the manner provided in the Bylaws. 
 Section 2. Until the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2008, The Board of Directors will be divided into three classes: Class
1, Class 2, and Class 3. Each such Class will consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. Until the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2008, each director will
serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting of shareholders following the annual meeting at which such director was elected. The terms of office of all directors who are in office immediately prior to the closing of the polls for
the election of directors at the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company shall expire at such time. At each annual meeting of shareholders beginning with the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company, directors shall not have
staggered terms, and the directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office.    Section 3. In the event of an increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors
prior to the 2008 annual meeting, (a) each director then serving as such will nevertheless continue as a director of the Class in which he or she is a member until the 2008 annual meeting, or his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or
death, and (b) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease will be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three Classes of directors so as to maintain such Classes as nearly equal as possible until
the 2008 annual meeting.  

. No director may be removed from office without cause except by a vote of two-thirds of the shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors. Except as otherwise provided by law, cause for removal will exist only if the Board of Directors has reasonable grounds to believe that the corporation has suffered or will suffer substantial injury
as a result of the gross negligence or dishonesty of the director whose removal is proposed.    AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES  
 . The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of its Articles of Incorporation to the extent permitted by the laws
of the State of Oregon. All rights of shareholders are granted subject to this reservation.    . The Board of Directors will have full power to
adopt, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation or to adopt new Bylaws. Nothing herein, however, will deny the concurrent power of the shareholders to adopt, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws.

undersigned, declare under the penalties of perjury that I have examined the foregoing and to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct and complete.

corporation, hereby submits these Articles of Amendment for filing:     FIRST : The name of the corporation is Pacific Continental
Corporation (the  Corporation )  

SECOND : The Corporation s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation

majority of the votes cast with respect to the director, provided that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes present and entitled to vote on the election of directors at any such meeting for which the number of nominees (other than
nominees withdrawn on or prior to the day preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice for such meeting to the shareholders) exceeds the number of directors to be elected. For purposes of this Article XI, action at a meeting shall
mean action at a meeting which satisfies the notice and quorum requirements imposed by the Bylaws of the corporation, or as otherwise provided by law, and a majority of the votes cast means that the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation with respect to the election of a director nominee that are voted  for  such nominee must exceed the votes that are voted  against  that director by the holders of
outstanding shares of the corporation s capital stock entitled to cast a vote with respect to the election of such director nominee.
