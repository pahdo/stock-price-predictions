Note 1   Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Lawson Products, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Reference should be made to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of the Company, all normal recurring adjustments have been made that are necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the interim periods. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . Certain reclassifications have been made to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for   September 30, 2015   to conform to current period presentation. 
    
  The Company operates in one reportable segment as a Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") distributor of products and services to the industrial, commercial, institutional, and governmental maintenance, repair and operations marketplace.  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , stock options to purchase   40,000   of the Company's common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.  
    
  There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

Note 2   Restricted Cash 
    
  The Company has agreed to maintain   $0.8 million   in a money market account as collateral for an outside party that is providing certain commercial card processing services for the Company. The Company is restricted from withdrawing this balance without the prior consent of the outside party during the term of the agreement. 

Note 3   Inventories, net 
    
  Inventories, net, consisting primarily of purchased goods which are offered for resale, were as follows:

Note 4   Acquisition and Goodwill 
    
  In the nine months of 2016, the Company acquired the assets of Perfect Products Company of Michigan, an auto parts distributor for approximately   $1.3 million   in cash and   $30 thousand   in contingent consideration. The Company also acquired the assets of F.B. Feeney Hardware in Ontario, Canada, for approximately   $1.3 million   in cash and   $84 thousand   in contingent consideration. Total contingent consideration of   $114 thousand   was not reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
    
  These transactions resulted in additional goodwill which is included in the table below: 

Additionally,   $0.7 million   of the purchase price related to customer relationships was allocated to an intangible asset included in Other  assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets which will be amortized over   5 years  . The preliminary allocation of the purchase price and resulting preliminary goodwill is subject to finalizing the valuation of certain assets. 

Note 5   Loan Agreement 
    
  In 2012, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ). The Loan Agreement consists of a   $40.0 million   revolving line of credit facility, which includes a   $10.0 million   sub-facility for letters of credit. Certain terms of the original Loan Agreement were revised in December 2013, by a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement ("Second Amendment") and in September 2016, by a Sixth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement ("Sixth Amendment"). The Loan Agreement, as amended, expires in August 2020. Due to the lock box arrangement and a subjective acceleration clause contained in the Loan Agreement, any outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit are classified as a current liability.   
    
  Currently, credit available under the Loan Agreement, as amended, is based upon: 
    
           a) 
    85%   of the face amount of the Company s eligible accounts receivable, generally less than   60   days past due, and 
       
           b) 
    the lesser of   60%   of the lower of cost or market value of the Company s eligible inventory, generally inventory expected to be sold within   18 months  , or   $20.0 million  . 
       
  The applicable interest rates for borrowings are at the Prime rate or, if the Company elects, the LIBOR rate plus   1.50%   to   1.85%   based on the Company s debt to EBITDA ratio. The Loan Agreement is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all existing assets of the Company. Dividends are restricted to amounts not to exceed   $7.0 million   annually. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   borrowings under its revolving line of credit facility and additional borrowing availability of   $34.8 million  . The Company paid interest of   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The weighted average interest rate was   3.5%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition to other customary representations, warranties and covenants, the Company is required to meet a minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA to fixed charges ratio, as defined in the amended Loan Agreement, and a minimum quarterly tangible net worth level as defined in the amended Loan Agreement, if the excess capacity is below   $10.0 million  . On   September 30, 2016  , the Company's borrowing capacity exceeded   $10.0 million  , therefore, the Company was not subject to these financial covenants, however, for informational purposes the results of the financial covenants are provided below:

Note 6   Severance Reserve 
    
  Changes in the Company s reserve for severance as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:  

Note 7   Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company recorded a benefit for stock-based compensation of   $1.3 million   for the first nine months of 2016, as a portion of stock-based compensation is related to the market value of the Company's common stock which declined during the period. The Company recorded  an expense of   $0.4 million   for stock-based compensation for the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  A summary of stock-based awards issued during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   follows:  
    
  Stock Performance Rights ("SPRs") 
  The Company issued   53,503   SPRs to key employees with an exercise price of   $18.98   per share that cliff vest on December 31, 2018 and have a termination date of December 31, 2023. 
    
  Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") 
  The Company issued   28,567   RSUs to the Company's directors with a vesting date of May 17, 2017. Each RSU is exchangeable for one share of the Company's common stock at the end of the vesting period. 
    
  Market Stock Units ("MSUs") 
  The Company issued   74,866   MSUs to key employees that cliff vest on December 31, 2018. MSU's are exchangeable for the Company's common stock at the end of the vesting period. The number of shares of common stock that will be issued upon vesting, ranging from   zero   to   112,300  , will be determined based upon the trailing sixty-day average closing price of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2018.  

Note 8   Income Taxes 
    
  Primarily due to the cumulative losses that the Company has incurred over the past three years, the Company has determined that there is insufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income. Therefore, substantially all deferred tax assets are currently subject to a tax valuation allowance. However, sufficient evidence may become available in future periods regarding the utilization of deferred tax assets that would lead to the reduction of all or a portion of the valuation allowance resulting in a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the reduction is recorded. Although the Company is in this full tax valuation allowance position, a tax expense of   $0.5 million   and   $0.5 million   was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to reserves for uncertain tax positions net of state tax refunds. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. Federal income tax, as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for the years 2013 through 2015 and income tax examinations from various other jurisdictions for the years 2006 through 2015. The Company is also subject to an examination by the Canada Revenue Authority ("CRA") for the years 2006 through 2010. The CRA examination was completed during May 2013 and resulted in proposed adjustments which amount to   $1.3 million   of additional tax for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. The Company did not agree with these adjustments and filed a request with Competent Authority programs in both the U.S. and Canada in October 2013. The Competent Authority program assists taxpayers with respect to matters covered in the mutual agreement procedure provisions of tax treaties. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Competent Authority completed their review and communicated to the Company that they proposed to assess a tax on the 2009 tax year only. 
    
   The Company received and accepted a formal letter of disposition from Competent Authority in the second quarter of 2016. Based on the proposed assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company recorded an expense of approximately   $0.8 million   in Canada and a related benefit of   $0.5 million   in the U.S.

Table of Contents  

Earnings from the Company s foreign subsidiary are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. A distribution of these non-U.S. earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise would subject the Company to both U.S. Federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for foreign tax credits.  
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, as the result of two small acquisitions, the Company recorded   $1.8 million   of tax deductible goodwill that may result in a tax benefit in future periods. 

Note 9   Contingent Liabilities 
    
  In 2012, the Company identified that a site it owns in Decatur, Alabama, contains hazardous substances in the soil and groundwater as a result of historical operations prior to the Company's ownership. The Company retained an environmental consulting firm to further investigate the contamination including the measurement and monitoring of the site. In August 2013, the site was enrolled in Alabama's voluntary cleanup program. On October 30, 2014, the Company received estimates from its environmental consulting firm with three potential remediation solutions. The estimates included a range of viable remedial approaches. The first solution included limited excavation and removal of the contaminated soil along with monitoring for a period up to   10   years. The second solution included the first solution plus the installation of a groundwater extraction system. The third scenario included the first and second solutions plus treatment injections to reduce the degradation time. The estimated expenditures over a   10  -year period under the three scenarios ranged from   $0.3 million   to   $1.4 million  , of which up to   $0.3 million   may be capitalized. As the Company has determined that a loss was probable, however no scenario was more likely than the other at that time, a liability in the amount of   $0.3 million   was established in 2014. 
    
  During 2015, after further evidence had been collected and analyzed, the Company concluded that it was probable that future remediation would be required, and accordingly accrued an additional   $0.9 million   for the estimated costs. This estimate is based on the information developed to date and as the remediation efforts proceed, additional information may impact the final cost. As of   September 30, 2016  , agreement with Alabama s voluntary cleanup program on viable treatment of the property has not yet been reached and the Company continues to evaluate potential remediation alternatives that could impact the ultimate cost of remediation. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $1.1 million   was accrued for remediation in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 
    
  The Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") distribution industry is highly fragmented. We compete for business with several national distributors as well as a large number of regional and local distributors. The MRO business is significantly impacted by the overall strength of the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy. One measure used to evaluate the strength of the industrial products market is the PMI index published by the Institute for Supply Management, which is considered by many economists to be a reliable near-term economic barometer of the manufacturing sector. A measure above 50 generally indicates expansion of the manufacturing sector while a measure below 50 generally represents contraction. The average monthly PMI was   51.2   in the   third quarter of 2016   and   51.0   in the   third quarter of 2015  , indicating modest growth in the U.S. manufacturing economy. The MRO distribution industry continues to experience generally slow growth due to many factors with the most prominent factor negatively impacting Lawson being a slow-down in the oil and gas end markets due to lower oil prices. 
    
  Our sales are also affected by the number of sales representatives and the amount of sales which each representative can generate, which we measure as average sales per day per sales representative. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a  sales force of   1,006   sales representatives,  an increase of   81   over the prior year quarter. While we anticipate future sales growth from our expanded sales force, we also anticipate a short-term decrease in average sales per day per sales representative, as new representatives build up customer relationships in their territories. Following the acceleration in the size of our sales force in the first two quarters of 2016, we have moderated the rate of hiring incremental sales representatives in the third quarter, and we anticipate that the pace of rep growth growth will be slower in the near future as we concentrate our efforts on providing training and support for our expanded sales force to drive their productivity. 

Quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to quarter ended   September 30, 2015

Net Sales 
    
  Net sales were   $70.2 million   for both the   third quarter of 2016   and 2015, respectively. Sales generated from the addition of more sales representatives year over year were negatively impacted by a general slow-down in the MRO marketplace, weaker demand from customers operating in the oil and gas industry. Sales to oil and gas customers declined   $0.8 million   from the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by an increase in sales by our Kent Automotive and government businesses. The third quarter of both 2016 and 2015 had 64 selling days. Average daily sales were essentially flat at to   $1.097 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the prior year quarter. 
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit decreased to   $42.6 million   in the third quarter of 2016 compared to   $43.3 million   in the third quarter of 2015 and decreased as a percent of sales to   60.6%   from   61.7%   a year ago. Product margin remained consistent versus a year ago, however, gross profit percentage declined primarily as a result of increased net freight expense, a non-recurring Canadian inventory transfer tax and lower vendor rebates on decreased inventory purchases. 
    
  Selling Expenses 
    
  Selling expenses consist of compensation paid to our sales representatives and related expenses to support our sales efforts. Selling expenses increased to   $23.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $22.2 million   in the prior year quarter and as a percent of sales, increased to   33.6%   compared to   31.7%   in the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily related to the increase in the number of sales representatives.  
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  General and administrative expenses consist of expenses to operate our distribution network and overhead expenses to manage the business. General and administrative expenses decreased to   $16.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $18.3 million   in the prior year quarter due primarily to lower stock-based and performance-based compensation expenses, and our continuing efforts to control costs, which were offset partially offset by increased health insurance claims 
    
  Interest and Other Expenses, Net 
    
  Interest expense, net was   $0.1 million   in both the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  Primarily due to historical cumulative losses, all of our deferred tax assets are currently subject to a tax valuation allowance. Although we are in a full tax valuation allowance position, an income tax expense of   $0.5 million    and   $0.2 million   was recorded in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to state taxes and reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
    
  Net Income 
    
  We reported net income of   $1.8 million   and   $2.4 million   in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Sales in the first nine months of 2016 were negatively impacted by a general slow-down in the MRO marketplace, weaker demand from customers operating in the oil and gas industry, a decrease in the Canadian exchange rate and lower productivity from newly hired sales representatives as they build out their territories. Sales to oil and gas customers declined   $2.6 million   and total net sales were negatively impacted by the Canadian exchange rate by   $0.8 million   compared to the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase in sales by our Kent Automotive Division and growing existing strategic account relationships. The first nine months of 2016 had   192   selling days compared to   191   in the first nine months of 2015. Average daily sales decreased to   $1.090 million   in the first nine months of 2016 compared to   $1.104 million   in the prior year period. 
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit decreased to   $127.6 million   in the first nine months of 2016 compared to   $130.0 million   in the first nine months of 2015 and decreased as a percent of sales to   61.0%   from   61.7%   a year ago. Product margin remained consistent versus a year ago, however, as a result of rebalancing and refining our inventory forecasting process, we incurred additional labor and freight costs during the first nine months of 2016. Additionally, the gross margin percentage was lower due to increased net freight expense and additional labor expenses related to repackaging inventory from acquisitions. 
    
  Selling Expenses 
    
  Selling expenses increased to   $69.5 million   or   33.2%   as a percent of sales in the first nine months of 2016 from   $68.6 million   and   32.5%   as a percent of sales in the first nine months of 2015. An increase in expenses related to the increase in the number of sales representatives was somewhat offset by   $1.9 million   of expenses related to the North American sales meeting held in 2015 which was not held in 2016. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased to   $54.4 million   in the first nine months of 2016 from   $56.3 million   in the prior year period due as a   $1.7 million   decrease in stock-based and performance-based compensation was offset by increased employee and acquisition related costs.

Interest and Other Expenses, Net 
    
  Interest and other expenses, net improved by   $0.6 million   in the first nine months of 2016, mostly due to currency exchange gains in 2016 compared to currency exchange losses in 2015. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  Primarily due to historical cumulative losses, substantially all of our deferred tax assets are subject to a tax valuation allowance. Although we are in a full tax valuation allowance position, an income tax expense of   $0.5 million   was recorded in the first nine months of both 2016 and 2015, primarily due to state taxes and reserves for uncertain tax positions.  
    
  Net Income 
    
  We reported net income of   $3.0 million   and   $4.0 million   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $10.7 million   on   September 30, 2016   compared to   $10.8 million   on   December 31, 2015  . The net cash provided by operations of   $5.3 million   and   $6.2 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, was primarily generated by operating earnings and improvements in net working capital. 
    
   Capital expenditures, primarily for improvements to our distribution centers and information technology, were   $2.6 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.9 million   in the prior year period. In 2016, we invested   $2.6 million   in the acquisition of two small MRO distributors.  
    
  On   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   borrowings on our revolving line of credit and no dividends were paid to shareholders in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015. Dividends are currently restricted under the Loan Agreement to amounts not to exceed $7.0 million annually. 
    
  Loan Agreement 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Loan Agreement that extended the maturity date to August 8, 2020. We also received an increase in the credit available under the Loan Agreement from 80% to 85% of our eligible accounts receivable, as defined in the Sixth Amendment, and from 50% to 60% of our eligible inventory, as defined in the Sixth Amendment, up to the facility limit of $40.0 million.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had additional borrowing availability of   $34.8 million  . We believe cash provided by operations and funds available under our Loan Agreement are sufficient to fund our operating requirements, strategic initiatives and capital improvements throughout the remainder of   2016  .   
    
  In addition to other customary representations, warranties and covenants, we are required to meet a minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA to fixed charges ratio, as defined in the amended Loan Agreement, and a minimum quarterly tangible net worth level as defined in the amended Loan Agreement, if the excess capacity is below   $10.0 million  . On   September 30, 2016  , our borrowing capacity exceeded   $10.0 million  , therefore, we were not subject to these financial covenants, however, for informational purposes we have provided the results of the financial covenants below: 

While we were in compliance with the financial covenants for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , failure to meet these covenant requirements in future quarters could lead to higher financing costs, increased restrictions, or reduce or eliminate our ability to borrow funds and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  There have been no material changes in market risk at   September 30, 2016   from that reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that (i) the information relating to Lawson, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
