NOTE
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Nature
of Business:    

Digital
Ally, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively,  Digital Ally,   Digital,  the  Company,   we, 
 ours  and  us ) produces digital video imaging and storage products for use in law enforcement, security
and commercial applications. Its products are an in-car digital video/audio recorder contained in a rear-view mirror for use in
law enforcement and commercial fleets; a system that provides its law enforcement customers with audio/video surveillance from
multiple vantage points and hands-free automatic activation of body-worn cameras and in-car video systems; a miniature digital
video system designed to be worn on an individual s body; a weather-resistant mobile digital video recording system for
use on motorcycles, ATV s and boats; and a hand-held laser speed detection device that it is offering primarily to law enforcement
agencies. The Company has active research and development programs to adapt its technologies to other applications. It has the
ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to address
needs in a variety of other industries and markets, including mass transit, school bus, taxi cab and the military. The Company
sells its products to law enforcement agencies and other security organizations, consumer and commercial fleet operators through
direct sales domestically and third-party distributors internationally.  

The
Company was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. and had no operations until 2004. On November
30, 2004, Vegas Petra, Inc. entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., at which time the merged entity was renamed
Digital Ally, Inc.  

The
following is a summary of the Company s Significant Accounting Policies:    

Basis
of Consolidation:    

The
accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Digital Ally and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital
Ally International, Inc., MP Ally, LLC, and Medical Devices Ally, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
during consolidation.  

The
Company formed Digital Ally International, Inc. during August 2009 to facilitate the export sales of its products. In addition,
Medical Devices Ally, LLC was formed in July 2014 and MP Ally, LLC was formed in July 2015, both of which have been inactive since
formation.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments:   

The
carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The Company accounts for its derivative liabilities on its fair value
basis.  

Revenue
Recognition:    

Revenues
from the sale of products are recorded when the product is shipped, title and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser,
payment terms are fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured. Customers do not have a right to return the product
other than for warranty reasons for which they would only receive repair services or replacement product.  

The
Company sells its products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner:  

Sales
    to domestic customers are made direct to the end customer (typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer) through
    its direct sales force, which is composed of its employees. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer.   

Sales
    to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from the Company at a wholesale
    price and sell to the end user (typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The distributor
    retains the margin as its compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product inventory,
    customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the
    distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement.    

Repair
    parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by its inside customer service employees.
    Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer.    

Sales
taxes collected on products sold are excluded from revenues and are reported as an accrued expense in the accompanying balance
sheets until payments are remitted.  

Other
revenue is comprised of revenues from extended warranties, repair services and the sale of scrap and excess raw material and component
parts. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer.  

Extended
warranties are offered on selected products and when a customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated
as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the extended warranty on a straight line method.  

Sales
returns and allowances aggregated $61,673 and $77,282 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
$263,663 and $612,341 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Obligations for estimated sales returns
and allowances are recognized at the time of sales on an accrual basis. The accrual is determined based upon historical return
rates adjusted for known changes in key variables affecting these return rates.  

Use
of Estimates:    

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and cash equivalents:    

Cash
and cash equivalents include funds on hand, in bank and short-term investments with original maturities of ninety (90) days or
less.  

Accounts
Receivable:    

Accounts
receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding
amounts on a weekly basis. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer
receivables and considering a customer s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. Trade receivables
are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received.  

A
trade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than thirty (30)
days beyond terms. No interest is charged on overdue trade receivables.  

Inventories:

Inventories
consist of electronic parts, circuitry boards, camera parts and ancillary parts (collectively,  components ), work-in-process
and finished goods, and are carried at the lower of cost (First-in, First-out Method) or market value. The Company determines
the estimate for the reserve for slow moving or obsolete inventories by regularly evaluating individual inventory levels, projected
sales and current economic conditions.  

Furniture,
fixtures and equipment:    

Furniture,
fixtures and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Additions and improvements are capitalized while ordinary
maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recorded by the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to ten years. Amortization expense on capitalized leases is included
with depreciation expense.  

Intangible
assets:    

Intangible
assets include deferred patent costs and license agreements. Legal expenses incurred in preparation of patent application have
been deferred and will be amortized over the useful life of granted patents. Costs incurred in preparation of applications that
are not granted will be charged to expense at that time. The Company has entered into several sublicense agreements under which
it has been assigned the exclusive rights to certain licensed materials used in its products. These sublicense agreements generally
require upfront payments to obtain the exclusive rights to such material. The Company capitalizes the upfront payments as intangible
assets and amortizes such costs over their estimated useful life on a straight line method.  

Long-Lived
Assets:    

Long-lived
assets such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances
require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or
asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying
value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models,
quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as considered necessary.  

Warranties:

The
Company s products carry explicit product warranties that extend up to two years from the date of shipment. The Company
records a provision for estimated warranty costs based upon historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these
provisions to reflect actual experience. Accrued warranty costs are included in accrued expenses. Extended warranties are offered
on selected products and when a customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as deferred revenue
and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.  

Customer
Deposits:    

The
Company requires deposits in advance of shipment for certain customer sales orders, in particular when accepting orders from foreign
customers for which the Company does not have a payment history. Customer deposits are reflected as a current liability in the
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs:    

Shipping
and handling costs for outbound sales orders totaled $26,077 and $22,480 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $72,296 and $69,691 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such costs are included
in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Advertising
Costs:    

Advertising
expense includes costs related to trade shows and conventions, promotional material and supplies, and media costs. Advertising
costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The Company incurred total advertising expense of approximately $615,586
and $324,179 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $936,998 and $658,558 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Income
Taxes:    

Deferred
taxes are provided for by the liability method wherein deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.
Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  

The
Company applies the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) No. 740 - Income Taxes that provides a framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and provided
a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. It initially recognizes tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely
than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently
measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with
the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Application requires numerous estimates based
on available information. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits,
and it recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. As it obtains additional information,
the Company may need to periodically adjust its recognized tax positions and tax benefits. These periodic adjustments may have
a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations.  

The
Company s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as income tax
expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There was no interest expense related to the underpayment of estimated taxes
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There have been no penalties in the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.  

Research
and Development Expenses:    

The
Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established
and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company s products are released
soon after technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility
were not significant, and software development costs were expensed as incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.  

Stock-Based
Compensation:    

The
Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees, board of directors and certain third party contractors. Share-based
compensation arrangements may include the issuance of options to purchase common stock in the future or the issuance of restricted
stock, which generally are subject to vesting requirements. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based
compensation granted based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the award.  

The
Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Assumptions used
to estimate compensation expense are determined as follows:  

Expected
    term is determined using the contractual term and vesting period of the award;    

Expected
    volatility of award grants made in the Company s plan is measured using the weighted average of historical daily changes
    in the market price of the Company s common stock over the period equal to the expected term of the award;    

Expected
    dividend rate is determined based on expected dividends to be declared;    

Risk-free
    interest rate is equivalent to the implied yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity equal to the expected
    term of the awards; and    

Forfeitures
    are based on the history of cancellations of awards granted and management s analysis of potential    

Segments
of Business:    

Management
has determined that its operations are comprised of one reportable segment: the sale of digital audio and video recording and
speed detection devices. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, sales by geographic area were as follows:  

Sales
to customers outside of the United States are denominated in U.S. dollars. All Company assets are physically located within the
United States.  

Accounting
Developments:    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 ( ASU 2014-09 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled
for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance
in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company has not yet selected
a transition method and is currently evaluating the standard and the impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote
disclosures.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330):  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The amendments
in the ASU require entities that measure inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods to measure inventory
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course
of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective
basis. This ASU will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption of ASU 2015-11
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs.  This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. This ASU was effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard
did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . This
ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the requirement for entities to separate deferred tax
liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in classified balance sheets. Instead, it requires deferred tax assets
and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted,
and this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods
presented. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this
standard on its consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . The objective of ASU 2016-09
is to reduce the complexity of certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. As a result of
this ASU, there are changes to minimum statutory withholding requirements, accounting for forfeitures, and accounting for income
taxes. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine month periods September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

The
condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete
financial statements.  

For
further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
3. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS    

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable. Sales to domestic
customers are typically made on credit and the Company generally does not require collateral. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers  financial condition and maintains an allowance for estimated losses. Accounts are written
off when deemed uncollectible and accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for
doubtful accounts totaled $70,000 as of September 30, 2016 and $74,977 as of December 31, 2015.  

The
Company sells through a network of unaffiliated distributors for international sales and primarily employee-based sales agents
for domestic sales. No distributor/agent individually exceeded 10% of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 or September 30, 2015. No customer receivable balance exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016.
One customer receivable balance exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2015, which totaled $372,453, or
12% of total accounts receivable.  

The
Company purchases finished circuit boards and other proprietary component parts from suppliers located in the United States and
from Asia. Although the Company obtains certain of these components from single source suppliers, the Company generally owns all
tooling and management has located or is in process of locating alternative suppliers to reduce the risk in most cases to supplier
problems that could result in significant production delays. The Company has not historically experienced any significant supply
disruptions from any of its principal vendors and does not anticipate future supply disruptions. The Company acquires most of
its components on a purchase order basis and does not have long-term contracts with its suppliers.  

NOTE
4. INVENTORIES    

Inventories
consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Finished
goods inventory includes units held by potential customers and sales agents for test and evaluation purposes. The cost of such
units totaled $685,909 and $651,004 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

NOTE
5. SECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE, AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS   

Secured
Convertible Note Payable    

Between
February 13 and 25, 2015 the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining
principal of $3,963,780 into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest at the conversion price of $7.32
per share. The increase in fair market value of these 655,213 shares over the $3,963,780 principal retired was $4,434,383 representing
the increase in our stock price over the conversion rate as of the conversion dates. Such amount was recognized as a charge to
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and included in change in fair
value of secured convertible notes payable.  

On
March 24, 2015 the holder exercised part of its Warrant to purchase 212,295 shares of common stock with the change in value of
the warrant derivative totaling $340,722 being recognized as income in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations representing
the change in the Company s stock price compared to the exercise price at the respective exercise date. On April 9, 2015
the holder exercised part of its Warrant to purchase 37,800 shares of common stock with the change in value of the warrant derivative
totaling $127,951 being recognized as income in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations representing the change in
the Company s stock price compared to the exercise price at the respective exercise date. As of September 30, 2016, the
remaining Warrant was exercisable to purchase 12,200 common shares and was recorded as a liability at its fair value in the amount
of $48,313 on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Capital
Leases  . Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital leases having terms in excess of one year are as follows:  

Assets
under capital leases are included in furniture, fixtures and equipment as follows:  

NOTE
6. Fair Value Measurement   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 820    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), the Company utilizes
the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets
or liabilities, such as a business.  

ASC
820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
    1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   

Level
    2   Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities)   

Level
    3   Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value)   

The
following table represents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
following table represents the change in level 3 tier value measurements:  

NOTE
7. ACCRUED EXPENSES    

Accrued
expenses consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Accrued
warranty expense was comprised of the following for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

NOTE
8. INCOME TAXES   

The
effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 varied from the expected statutory rate due
to the Company continuing to provide a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The Company determined that it was
appropriate to continue the full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 primarily because of
the current year operating losses.  

The
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets totaled $21,215,000 and $18,105,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.  

The
Company records the benefit it will derive in future accounting periods from tax losses and credits and deductible temporary differences
as  deferred tax assets.  In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,  Income Taxes, 
the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets if, based on all available evidence,
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had available approximately $37,514,000 of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset
future taxable income generated. Such tax net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2023 and 2036. In addition, the Company
had research and development tax credit carryforwards approximating $1,872,000 available as of September 30, 2016, which expire
between 2023 and 2036.  

The
Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company s ability to utilize net operating loss
carry-forwards in the event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Current estimates
prepared by the Company indicate that due to ownership changes which have occurred, approximately $765,000 of its net operating
loss and $175,000 of its research and development tax credit carryforwards are currently subject to an annual limitation of approximately
$1,151,000, but may be further limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future. As stated above, the net
operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards expire between 2023 and 2036, allowing the Company to potentially
utilize all of the limited net operating loss carry-forwards during the carryforward period.  

As
discussed in Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process.
The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax
position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize
in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management has identified no tax positions taken that would meet or exceed these thresholds
and therefore there are no gross interest, penalties and unrecognized tax expense/benefits that are not expected to ultimately
result in payment or receipt of cash in the consolidated financial statements.  

The
Company s federal and state income tax returns are closed for examination purposes by relevant statute and by examination
for 2011 and all prior tax years.  

NOTE
9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

Operating
Leases.   The Company had several non-cancelable operating lease agreements for office space and warehouse space that expire
at various dates through April 2020. The Company also entered into month-to-month leases for equipment. Rent expense was $99,431
and $99,431 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $298,293 and $302,414, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Following are the future minimum lease payments for each year and in total.  

License
agreements.   The Company has several license agreements whereby it has been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials
used in its products. Certain of these agreements require the Company to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products
shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis. Royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated $6,250 and
$6,641 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $18,911 and $19,957 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Litigation.
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no
assurances, based on the information currently available, management believes that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of
each of the actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. However,
an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company in the
period in which it is recorded.  

On
October 25, 2013, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to eliminate threats
by a competitor, Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility ), of alleged patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,831,556
(the    556 Patent ). Specifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that the Company s mobile video surveillance
systems do not infringe any claim of the  556 Patent. The Company became aware that Utility had mailed letters to current
and prospective purchasers of its mobile video surveillance systems threatening that the use of such systems purchased from third
parties not licensed to the  556 Patent would create liability for them for patent infringement. The Company rejects Utility s
assertion and will vigorously defend the right of end-users to purchase such systems from providers other than Utility. The United
States District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the lawsuit because it decided that Kansas was not the proper jurisdictional
forum for the dispute. The District Court s decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case. The Company appealed the
decision and the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court s previous decision.  

In
addition, the Company began proceedings to invalidate the  556 Patent through a request for  inter partes review  of
the  556 patent at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ). On July 27, 2015, the USPTO invalidated
key claims in Utility s  556 Patent. The Final Decision from the USPTO significantly curtails Utility s ability
to threaten law enforcement agencies, municipalities, and others with infringement of the  556 Patent. Utility has appealed
this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The parties  briefing their respective positions
to the Federal Circuit is expected to be completed by approximately fourth quarter 2016, at which time oral argument will be scheduled
by the Federal Circuit. The Company believes that Utility will have a difficult time convincing the appellate court to overturn
the decision of the USPTO, although no assurances can be offered in this regard.  

On
September 4, 2014 the Company filed an Unfair Competition lawsuit against Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility ) in
the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the lawsuit it contends that Utility has defamed the Company and
illegally interfered with its contracts, customer relationships and business expectancies by falsely asserting to its customers
and others that its products violate the  556 Patent, of which Utility claims to be the holder.  

The
suit also includes claims against Utility for tortious interference with contract and violation of the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets
Act (KUSTA), arising out of Utility s employment of the Company s employees, in violation of that employee s
Non-Competition and Confidentiality agreements with the Company. In addition to damages, the Company seeks temporary, preliminary,
and permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting Utility from, among other things, continuing to threaten or otherwise interfere with
the Company s customers. On March 4, 2015, an initial hearing was held upon the Company s request for injunctive relief.  

Based
upon facts revealed at the March 4, 2015 hearing, on March 16, 2015, the Company sought leave to amend its Complaint in the Kansas
suit to assert additional claims against Utility. Those new claims include claims of actual or attempted monopolization, in violation
of   2 of the Sherman Act, claims arising under a new Georgia statute that prohibits threats of patent infringement in  bad
faith,  and additional claims of unfair competition/false advertising in violation of   63(a) of the Lanham Act. As
these statutes expressly provide, the Company will seek treble damages, punitive damages and attorneys  fees as well as
injunctive relief. The Court concluded its hearing on April 22, 2015, and allowed the Company leave to amend its complaint, but
denied its preliminary injunction. The discovery stage of the lawsuit expired in May 2016. Both parties have filed summary judgment
motions, which are currently under review and consideration by the court. The jury trial date is scheduled for June 2017. The
Company believes that the USPTO s final decision issued on July 27, 2015 will provide it with substantial basis to pursue
its claims either through summary judgment motions prior to trial or the jury trial itself and it intends to pursue recovery from
Utility, its insurers and other parties, as appropriate.  

On
September 13, 2014, Utility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company
alleging infringement of the  556 Patent. The suit was served on the Company on September 20, 2014. As alleged in the Company s
first filed lawsuit described above, the Company believes that the  556 Patent is both invalid and not infringed. Further,
the USPTO has issued its final decision invalidating 23 of the 25 claims asserted in the  556 Patent, as noted above. The
Company believes that the suit filed by Utility is without merit and is vigorously defending the claims asserted against the Company.
An adverse resolution of the foregoing litigation or patent proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Court stayed all proceedings with respect
to this lawsuit pending the outcome of the patent review performed by the USPTO and the appellate court. Based on the USPTO s
final decision to invalidate substantially all claims contained in the  556 Patent, the Company intends to file for summary
judgment in its favor if Utility does not request outright dismissal.  

The
Company received notice in April 2015 that Taser, one of its competitors, had commenced an action in the USPTO for a re-examination
of its U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (the    292 Patent). A re-examination is essentially a request that the USPTO review
whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the  prior art,  e.g., other patents in the same
technology field. The prior art used by Taser to request the re-examination is a patent application that never issued into a patent,
was assigned to an unrelated third party and was not the result of any of Taser s own research and development efforts.  

The
Company owns the  292 Patent, which is directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement
officer s body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and automatically instructs other recording devices to
begin recording. The technology described in the  292 Patent is incorporated in the Company s VuLink product.  

On
August 17, 2015 the USPTO issued a first, non-final action rejecting all 20 claims of the  292 Patent respecting its  292
Patent under an  ex parte  re-examination. The Company was provided the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art
and the scope of the patent claims with the patent Examiner handling the reexamination and to amend the patent claims. On January
14, 2016 the USPTO ultimately rejected Taser s efforts and confirmed the validity of the  292 Patent with 59 claims
covering various aspects of the Company s auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the USPTO issued another patent
relating to the Company s auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the  
 452 Patent ) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response
to a triggering event, such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.  

The
Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against
Taser, alleging willful patent infringement against Taser s Axon body camera product line. The lawsuit was initiated after
the USPTO reconfirmed the validity of the  292 Patent, which covers various aspects of auto-activation and multiple camera
coordination for body-worn cameras and in-car video systems. The  292 Patent previously was subject to attack by Taser,
which tried to invalidate it at the USPTO. The USPTO ultimately rejected Taser s efforts and confirmed the validity of the
 292 Patent with 59 claims covering various aspects of this valuable auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the
USPTO issued another patent relating to the Company s auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. This  452
Patent generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event
such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle. The Company added the  452 patent to its existing
lawsuit against Taser seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Taser for infringement of both the  452
and  292 Patents.  

In
addition to the infringement claims, the Company added a new set of claims to the lawsuit alleging that Taser conspired to keep
the Company out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical, and unfair competition. The amended lawsuit alleges Taser
bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal
antitrust law. The Company s lawsuit also seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including treble damages, for these alleged
violations.  

The
Company filed an amended complaint and Taser filed an answer which denied the patent infringement allegations on April 1, 2016.
In addition, Taser filed a motion to dismiss all allegations in the complaint on March 4, 2016 for which the Company filed an
amended complaint on March 18, 2016 to address certain technical deficiencies in the pleadings. Taser amended and renewed its
motion to seek dismissal of the allegations that it had bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for
its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law on April 1, 2016. Formal discovery commenced on April 12,
2016 with respect to the patent related claims. The Company won its motion to commence discovery on the bribery related claims,
which discovery commenced in October 2016. The Court has yet to rule on Taser s motion to dismiss the portion of the lawsuit
regarding claims that it had bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation
of both state law and federal antitrust law.  

On
May 27, 2016 the Company filed suit against Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video ( WatchGuard ), alleging
patent infringement based on WatchGuard s VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines. The Company filed the suit in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas.  

The
USPTO has granted multiple patents to the Company with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically and simultaneously
activating all deployed cameras in response to the activation of just one camera. Additionally, Digital Ally s patent claims
cover automatic coordination as well as digital synchronization between multiple recording devices. Digital Ally also has patent
coverage directed to the coordination between a multi-camera system and an officer s smartphone, which allows an officer
to more readily assess an event on the scene while an event is taking place or immediately after it has occurred.  

The
Company s lawsuit alleges that WatchGuard incorporated this patented technology into its VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product
lines without its permission. Specifically, Digital Ally is accusing WatchGuard of infringing three patents: the  292 and
 452 Patents and U.S. Patent No. 9,325,950. The Company is aggressively challenging WatchGuard s infringing conduct,
seeking both monetary damages, as well as seeking a permanent injunction preventing WatchGuard from continuing to sell its VISTA
Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines using Digital Ally s own technology to compete against it. The lawsuit is in the early
stages of discovery.  

The
Company is also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental
to its business from time to time, including customer collections, vendor and employment-related matters. The Company believes
the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to its business or its financial condition.  

Sponsorship.
  On April 16, 2015 the Company entered into a Title Sponsorship Agreement (the  Agreement ) under which it
became the title sponsor for a Web.com Tour golf tournament (the  Tournament ) held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan
area. The Agreement provides the Company with naming rights and other benefits for the annual Tournament for the years 2015 through
2019 in exchange for the following sponsorship fee:  

The
Company has the right to sell and retain the proceeds from the sale of additional sponsorships, including but not limited to,
a presenting sponsorship, a concert sponsorship and founding partnerships for the Tournament. The Company recorded net sponsorship
expenses of $497,235 and $172,623 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $499,271 and $172,623
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such net sponsorship expense includes the sponsorship fee
and other costs related to the 2015 and 2016 Tournaments that have been completed.  

Stock
Repurchase Program  . On August 25, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a program that authorizes the repurchase of up
to $2.5 million of the Company s common stock in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases,
if and when made, will be subject to market conditions, applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other factors.
The repurchase program will be funded using a portion of cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flow from operations. Purchases
may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company had not repurchased any shares under this program as of September
30, 2016.  

401(k)
Plan.   In July 2008, the Company amended and restated its 401(k) retirement savings plan. The amended plan requires the
Company to provide 100% matching contributions for employees who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan
and 50% matching contributions for employee s elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. The Company has
made matching contributions totaling $46,346 and $47,220 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $135,058 and $121,920 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested
at all times in employee and employer matching contributions.  

Consulting
and Distributor Agreements.   The Company has entered into two agreements that require it to make monthly payments which
will be applied to future commissions and/or consulting fees to be earned by the provider:  

The
    first agreement is with an individual who provides consulting services for international sales opportunities for both our
    law enforcement and commercial product lines primarily in Europe. This individual is paid a monthly fee ranging from $4,000
    to $6,000 per month plus necessary and reasonable expenses for a period of one year beginning March 23, 2016, which can be
    extended by mutual agreement of the parties. In addition to the monthly fee, the provider can earn a success fee based upon
    the amount of sales generated by his activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had advanced a total of $39,781 pursuant
    to this agreement.    

The
    second agreement is with a limited liability company ( LLC ) that is partially owned by a relative of the Company s
    chief financial officer. Under the agreement, dated January 15, 2016, the LLC provides consulting services for developing
    a new distribution channel outside of law enforcement for its body-worn camera and related cloud storage products to customers
    in the United States. The Company pays the LLC an advance against commissions ranging from $5,000 to $6,000 per month plus
    necessary and reasonable expenses for a period of one year beginning January 2016, which agreement can be automatically extended
    based on the LLC achieving certain minimum sales quotas. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had advanced a total of $123,459
    pursuant to this agreement.    

NOTE
10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    

The
Company recorded pretax compensation expense related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock issued of $422,246 and
$479,084 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1,203,312 and $1,077,485, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had adopted seven separate stock option and restricted stock plans: (i) the 2005 Stock Option
and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2005 Plan ), (ii) the 2006 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2006
Plan ), (iii) the 2007 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2007 Plan ), (iv) the 2008 Stock Option
and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2008 Plan ), (v) the 2011 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2011
Plan ), (vi) the 2013 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2013 Plan ) and (vii) the 2015 Stock Option
and Restricted Stock Plan (the  2015 Plan ), which was amend in May 2016. These Plans permit the grant of stock options
or restricted stock to its employees, non-employee directors and others totaling 1,925,000 shares of common stock. The 2005 Plan
expired during 2015 with 28 shares reserved for awards which are unavailable for issuance. The Company believes that such awards
better align the interests of its employees with those of its shareholders. Option awards have been granted with an exercise price
equal to the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant with such option awards generally vesting based on
the completion of continuous service and having ten-year contractual terms. These option awards provide for accelerated vesting
if there is a change in control (as defined in the Plans) or the death or disability of the holder. The Company has registered
all shares of common stock that are issuable under its Plans with the SEC. A total of 290,802 shares remained available for grant
under the various Plans as of September 30, 2016.  

In
addition to the Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans described above, the Company has issued other options outside of these
Plans to non-employees for services rendered that are subject to the same general terms as the Plans, of which 1,250 options are
fully vested and remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. There were 40,000
stock options issued during 2016 to date. Activity in the various Plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is reflected
in the following table:  

The
Plans allow for the cashless exercise of stock options. This provision allows the option holder to surrender/cancel options with
an intrinsic value equivalent to the purchase/exercise price of other options exercised. There were no shares surrendered pursuant
to cashless exercises during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

At
September 30, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was approximately $298,582, and the aggregate intrinsic
value of options exercisable was approximately $198,719. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,898.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the unamortized portion of stock compensation expense on all existing stock options was $70,367, which
will be recognized over the next 14 months.  

The
following table summarizes the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable
options under the Company s option plans as of September 30, 2016:  

Restricted
stock grants.     The Board of Directors has granted restricted stock awards under the Plans. Restricted stock awards
are valued on the date of grant and have no purchase price for the recipient. Restricted stock awards typically vest over nine
months to four years corresponding to anniversaries of the grant date. Under the Plans, unvested shares of restricted stock awards
may be forfeited upon the termination of service to or employment with the Company, depending upon the circumstances of termination.
Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of restricted stock, holders of unvested restricted stock have full stockholder s
rights, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends.  

A
summary of all restricted stock activity under the equity compensation plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as
follows:  

The
Company estimated the fair market value of these restricted stock grants based on the closing market price on the date of grant.
As of September 30, 2016, there were $1,328,726 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to all remaining non-vested restricted
stock grants, which will be amortized over the next 42 months in accordance with the vesting scale.  

The
nonvested balance of restricted stock vests as follows:  

NOTE
11. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS   

The
Company issued common stock purchase warrants (the  Warrants ) in conjunction with the subordinated notes payable
held by an individual until they were paid in July 2015, the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note (see Note 5) and the July 2015
registered direct offering and private placement. The Warrants are immediately exercisable and allow the holders to purchase up
to 1,599,290 shares of common stock at $7.32 to $16.50 per share. The Warrants expire from July 22, 2017 through January 22, 2021
and allow for cashless exercise.  

The
total intrinsic value of all outstanding Warrants aggregated $-0- as of September 30, 2016 and the weighted average remaining
term is 34 months.  

The
following table summarizes the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable
Warrants to purchase common shares as of September 30, 2016:  

NOTE
12. PREFERRED STOCK   

The
Company held its annual meeting of the shareholders (the  Annual Meeting ) on May 12, 2016. The shareholders approved
an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of its capital stock
that the Company may issue from 25,000,000 to 35,000,000, of which 25,000,000 shares classified as common stock and 10,000,000
classified as preferred stock. The newly authorized preferred stock has a par value of $0.001 per share. There have been no preferred
shares issued as of September 30, 2016.  

The
Board of Directors is authorized, to provide for the issuance of the shares of preferred stock in series, and by filing a certificate
pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Nevada, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each
such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof. The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series of Preferred Stock will
include, but not be limited to, the rights to determine the following:  

The
    number of shares constituting that series of Preferred Stock and the distinctive designation of that series, which may be
    a distinguishing number, letter or title;   

The
    dividend rate on the shares of that series of Preferred Stock, whether dividends will be cumulative, and if so, from which
    date(s), and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends on shares of that series;   

Whether
    that series of Preferred Stock will have voting rights, in addition to the voting rights provided by law, and, if so, the
    terms of such voting rights;   

Whether
    that series of Preferred Stock will have conversion privileges and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion, including
    provision for adjustment of the conversion rate in such events as the Board of Directors determines;   

Whether
    or not the shares of that series of Preferred Stock will be redeemable and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption,
    including the date or date upon or after which they are redeemable, and the amount per share payable in case of redemption,
    which amount may vary under different conditions and at different redemption dates;   

Whether
    that series of Preferred Stock will have a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of that series and, if so,
    the terms and amount of such sinking fund;   

The
    rights of the shares of that series of Preferred Stock in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
    winding up of the Company, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of that series; and any other
    relative rights, preferences and limitations of that series of Preferred Stock.   

NOTE
13. NET LOSS PER SHARE   

The
calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding and loss per share outstanding for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

Basic
loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, all outstanding stock options to purchase common stock were antidilutive, and, therefore,
not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share.

first nine months of 2016; (2) macro-economic risks from the effects of the economic downturn and decrease in budgets for the
law-enforcement community; (3) our ability to increase revenues, increase our margins and return to consistent profitability in
the current economic and competitive environment; (4) our operation in developing markets and uncertainty as to market acceptance
of our technology and new products; (5) the impact of the federal government s stimulus program on the budgets of law enforcement
agencies, including the timing, amount and restrictions on funding; (6) our ability to deliver our new product offerings as scheduled
and have such new products perform as planned or advertised; (7) whether there will be commercial markets, domestically and internationally,
for one or more of our newer products, and the degree to which the interest shown in our products, including the FirstVU HD, VuLink,
VuVault.net, FleetVU and MicroVU HD, will translate into sales during 2016; (8) our ability to maintain or expand our share of
the market for our products in the domestic and international markets in which we compete, including increasing our international
revenues to their historical levels; (9) our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective manner; (10) competition from
larger, more established companies with far greater economic and human resources; (11) our ability to attract and retain quality
employees; (12) risks related to dealing with governmental entities as customers; (13) our expenditure of significant resources
in anticipation of sales due to our lengthy sales cycle and the potential to receive no revenue in return; (14) characterization
of our market by new products and rapid technological change; (15) our dependence on sales of our DVM-800, DVM-800 HD, FirstVU,
First VU HD, and DVM-250 products; (16) potential that stockholders may lose all or part of their investment if we are unable
to compete in our markets and return to profitability; (17) defects in our products that could impair our ability to sell our
products or could result in litigation and other significant costs; (18) our dependence on key personnel; (19) our reliance on
third party distributors and sales representatives for part of our marketing capability; (20) our dependence on a few manufacturers
and suppliers for components of our products and our dependence on domestic and foreign manufacturers for certain of our products;
(21) our ability to protect technology through patents; (22) our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information
as trade secrets and through other similar means; (23) risks related to our license arrangements; (24) our revenues and operating
results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter; (25) sufficient voting power by coalitions of a few of our larger
stockholders, including directors and officers, to make corporate governance decisions that could have significant effect on us
and the other stockholders; (26) sale of substantial amounts of our common stock that may have a depressive effect on the market
price of the outstanding shares of our common stock; (27) possible issuance of common stock subject to options and warrants that
may dilute the interest of stockholders; (28) our ability to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 as it may be required;
(29) our nonpayment of dividends and lack of plans to pay dividends in the future; (30) future sale of a substantial number of
shares of our common stock that could depress the trading price of our common stock, lower our value and make it more difficult
for us to raise capital; (31) our additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights
of the holders of our common stock; (32) our stock price is likely to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including
a relatively limited public float; (33) whether the legal actions that the Company is taking or has taken against Utility Associates,
Taser and WatchGuard will achieve their intended objectives; (34) whether Utility Associates  appeal of the United States
Patent Office ( USPTO ) final decision on the  556 Patent will be successful in whole or in part; (35) whether
the USPTO rulings will curtail, eliminate or otherwise have an effect on the actions of Taser and Utility Associates respecting
us, our products and customers; (36) whether the remaining two claims under the  556 Patent have applicability to us or
our products;   and (37) whether our patented VuLink technology becoming the  de-facto   standard  for agencies
engaged in deploying state-of-the-art body-worn and in-car camera systems; (38) whether this technology will have a significant
impact on our revenues in the long-term; and (37) indemnification of our officers and directors.  

Current
Trends and Recent Developments for the Company    

Overview   

We
supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities, for the law enforcement
and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio,
computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers  requests. We began shipping
our flagship digital video mirror product in March 2006. We have developed additional products to complement our DVM-750, one
of our original in-car digital video products, including lower priced in-car digital video mirrors (the DVM-100, DVM-400, DVM-800
and MicroVU HD), and body worn camera (FirstVU HD) products designed for law enforcement usage. Since 2011 we have launched the
following new products: the FirstVU HD; DVM-800; DVM-800 HD; the MicroVU HD; the patented VuLink product which integrates our
body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation; and the line of digital video mirrors
(the DVM-250 and DVM-250 Plus) that serve as  event recorders  for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets in
order to expand our customer base beyond the traditional law enforcement agencies. We have additional research and development
projects that we anticipate will result in several new product launches during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. We believe that
the launch of these new products will help to diversify and broaden the market for our product offerings.  

We
experienced operating losses for all of the quarters during 2016 and 2015. The following is a summary of our recent operating
results on a quarterly basis:  

Our
business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and
operating results in the above table. These variations result from various factors, including but not limited to: 1) the timing
of large individual orders; 2) the traction gained by our newer products, such as the FirstVU HD and FleetVU; 3) production, quality
and other supply chain issues affecting our cost of goods sold; 4) unusual increases in operating expenses, such as our sponsorship
of the Digital Ally Open golf tournament, the timing of trade shows and bonus compensation; and 5) litigation and related expenses
respecting outstanding lawsuits. We reported an operating loss of $3,241,641 on revenues of $4,339,527 for third quarter 2016
compared to an operating loss of $2,892,657 on revenues of $4,384,411 for second quarter 2016, an operating loss of $2,337,895
on revenues of $4,404,943 for first quarter 2016, an operating loss of $2,700,529 on revenues of $5,051,119 for fourth quarter
2015, and an operating loss of $2,140,785 on revenues of $5,096,088 for third quarter 2015.  

There
have been a number of factors and trends affecting our recent performance, which include:  

Revenues
    decreased in third quarter 2016 to $4,339,527 from $4,384,411 in second quarter 2016, $4,404,943 in first quarter 2016, $5,051,119
    in fourth quarter 2015, $5,096,088 in third quarter 2015 and $5,634,237 in second quarter 2015. We believe the decline in
    revenues in the last five quarters was attributable in part to Taser stating in one of its press releases in 2015 that all
    the claims in one of our patents were determined to be  unpatentable.  We believe its press release was misleading
    and incorrect, causing confusion and concern in our marketplace, customer base and potential customers. Taser commenced an
    action in the United States Patent   Trademark Office ( USPTO ) for a reexamination of our U.S. Patent No.
    8,781,292 (the    292 Patent ). A reexamination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the
    patent should have issued in its present form in view of the  prior art,  e.g., other patents in the same technology
    field. The  292 Patent relates to the  automatic trigger  that allows our body camera and in-car system
    to automatically begin recording without the need for law enforcement officers to manually turn them on. The automatic trigger
    covered by our  292 Patent is incorporated in our popular VuLink product. We believe the confusion and misinformation
    caused by our competitor has impacted our revenues of our VuLink product and body-worn and in-car systems. Ultimately, the
    USPTO rejected Taser s efforts and reconfirmed the validity of the  292 patent on January 16, 2016 and we have
    filed suit alleging willful patent infringement against Taser and included claims of commercial bribery and other unfair trade
    practices. See   Litigation   for details. However, we believe we continue to suffer from the ongoing perception
    issues and confusion caused by Taser s misleading press release and the reexamination of our patent commenced by Taser
    with the USPTO.   

Recognizing
    a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, during 2014 we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem
    that provided intuitive auto-activation functionality, as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The USPTO
    has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically
    activating an officer s body-worn camera when the light bar is activated or a data-recording device when a smart weapon
    is activated. Additionally, our patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices including in-car
    and body-worn camera systems. Prior to this work, officers were forced to manually activate each device while responding to
    emergency scenarios - a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers 
    attention during critical moments. We see a trend in which law enforcement agencies have recognized the value of our VuLink
    technology and seek information on  auto-activation  features in requests for bids and requests for information
    involving the procurement process of body-worn cameras and in-car systems. We believe this trend may result in our patented
    VuLink technology becoming the  de-facto   standard  for agencies engaged in deploying state-of-the-art body-worn
    and in-car camera systems. We expect that this technology will have a significant impact on our revenues in the long-term,
    particularly if we are successful in our prosecution of the patent infringement litigation currently pending with Taser.   

The
    DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, introduced in 2013, contributed 59% of total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
    to 55% for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015. We have recently announced the launch of the DVM-800 HD in-car
    video system which we believe will be disruptive in the market. The DVM-800 HD system provides full 1080P high definition
    video at a cost effective price point. We expect the sales mix will continue to migrate from the DVM-750 product line to the
    newer products in 2016 and beyond.    

Our
    gross margin percentage improved to 46.9% in third quarter 2016 from 28.9% in the second quarter 2016, 42.1% in first quarter
    2016, 31% in fourth quarter 2015 and 40.0% in third quarter 2015. Our gross margin decline in prior quarters was primarily
    attributable to the camera cable connector upgrade implemented in the third quarter 2015 to our FirstVU HD product that caused
    us to rework our entire installed base of FirstVU HD s and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. In second
    quarter 2016, the Company became aware of workmanship issues on the printed circuit boards ( PCB boards ) used
    in its FirstVU HD product which resulted in a higher failure rate. The workmanship problems resulted in a higher than normal
    rate of contaminated PCB boards in our finished goods inventory, as well as deployed units in the field that had to be replaced.
    The PCB boards were supplied by a contract manufacturer that did not follow the Company s specifications regarding the
    flux used in the soldering process for certain of the components utilized in the PCB board assemblies. The contract manufacturer
    corrected its process and quality control procedures to eradicate this issue. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector
    upgrade program and the workmanship issues on the contaminated PCB boards issues that effected previous quarters  gross
    margins has been completed and the estimated total costs have been accrued and charged to cost of sales as of September 30,
    2016. Therefore, management believes that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters as exhibited
    in third quarter 2016. We believe these issues also adversely affected our revenues in the third quarter 2016 by delaying
    delivery of products being replaced or reworked in the field and in inventory.   

Our
    international revenues increased to $1,154,412 (9% of total revenues) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
    to $114,413 (1% of total revenues) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our third quarter 2016 revenues were aided
    by approximately $760,000 of revenue from the sale of our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems and extended service
    agreement to a non-law enforcement international customer after a successful eight-week pilot program that will continue for
    three years. This order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our FirstVU HD body cameras across various industries
    and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement market.    

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations)
or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial
conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or
significant components of revenue or expenses.  

We
are a party to operating leases, title sponsorship, and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments (described
in Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements) and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business
that represent commitments for future payments for goods and services.

We
sell our products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner:  

Sales
    to domestic customers are made directly to the end customer (typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer)
    through our direct sales force, who are our employees. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer.   

Sales
    to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from us at a wholesale price and
    sell to the end user (typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The distributor retains
    the margin as its compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product inventory, customer
    receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor
    consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement.    

Repair
    parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees.
    Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer.    

We
may discount our prices on specific orders when considering the size of the order, the specific customer and the competitive landscape.
We believe that our systems are cost competitive compared to our principal competitors and generally are lower priced when considering
comparable features and capabilities.  

Revenues
for third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015 were derived from the following sources:

newer products, the DVM-800 and the FirstVU HD, contributed 54% of total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to 57% for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015. We believe this reduction is the result of customers waiting
for the recently announced DVM-800 HD to be available. We believe that the DVM-800, DVM-800 HD and FirstVU HD sales contribution
will resume its increases in future quarters. Our DVM-750 sales increased from 2% to 10% of total sales as expected orders were
shipped in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 from existing DVM-750 customers.  

Revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $4,339,527 and $5,096,088, respectively, a decrease of $756,561 (15%),
due to the following factors:  

Our
    revenues decreased approximately 15% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September
    30, 2015. We attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by Taser s misleading press release regarding our patents
    and the problems with the PCB boards in our FirstVU HD product. We expect FirstVU HD sales to recover during the remainder
    of 2016 and future quarters as we prosecute the patent lawsuits against Taser and WatchGuard. We believe the VuLink product
    differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented  auto-activation 
    technology.   

We
    shipped three orders in excess of $100,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 for total revenue of $1,133,000 compared
    to seven individual orders of such size for the three months ended September 30, 2015 for $1,286,000. Our average order size
    decreased to approximately $2,875 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,185 during the three months ended
    September 30, 2015. We maintained consistent retail pricing on our law enforcement mirror models during 2015 and do not plan
    any material changes in pricing during 2016, including the new products recently introduced. Our newer mirror-based products
    include the DVM-800, which is sold at lower retail pricing levels compared to our legacy products. For certain opportunities
    that involve multiple units and/or multi-year contracts, we have occasionally discounted our products to gain or retain market
    share and revenues.   

The
    DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, introduced in 2013, contributed 54% of total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
    compared to 57% for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015. We believe that some customers delayed their orders to
    wait for our recently announced DVM-800 HD to become available. We believe future quarters will yield increases in the sales
    of these newer products.   

Our
    international revenues increased to $827,452 (19% of total revenues) during third quarter 2016, compared to $3,151 (less than
    1% of total revenues) during third quarter 2015. Third quarter 2016 revenues were aided by approximately $760,000 of revenue
    generated by an order from a non-law enforcement international customer for our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems
    and extended service agreement. This order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our FirstVU HD body cameras across
    various industries and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement market.    

Cost
of Revenue   

Cost
of revenue on units sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,305,956 and $3,056,314, respectively, a
decrease of $750,358 (25%). The decrease in cost of goods sold is due to the 15% decrease in revenues and an overall reduction
in our cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues. The reduction in cost of revenue as a percent of revenue is primarily attributable
to the resolution of issues that have negatively impacted the FirstVU HD products in prior quarters. In the three months ended
September 30, 2015 it was determined that we needed to upgrade the connectors contained in the camera cable assembly on all of
our FirstVU HD product. This upgrade was applied to all deployed units in the field and to our inventory, requiring us to rework
the camera assemblies and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. Total scrap costs recognized in the third quarter 2015
approximated $850,000, which negatively affected our gross margin. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to 53%
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 60% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our goal is to maintain
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at 40% or less during the remainder of 2016. We expect that our newer product offerings,
in particular the DVM-800, DVM-800 HD, VuLink and FirstVU HD, should improve our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in
the longer term. We do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of our current products because
our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents, testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers.  

We
had $1,455,458 and $1,202,411 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Total raw materials and component parts were $4,168,866 and $3,833,873 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
an increase of $334,993 (9%). The increase in raw materials was mostly in refurbished parts for FirstVU HD products. Finished
goods balances were $7,452,101 and $7,895,663 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, a decrease of $443,562
(6%). The decrease in finished goods was primarily in DVM-750 and FirstVU HD products. Finished goods at September 30, 2016 consist
primarily of the Laser Ally products, and our DVM 750 products for expected orders. The increase in the inventory reserve is due
to the change in sales mix of our products, which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions
of our legacy products. We believe the established reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at September 30, 2016.  

Gross
Profit   

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,033,571 and $2,039,774, respectively, a decrease of $6,203
(less than 1%). The decrease is commensurate with the 15% decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues improving to 53% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 60% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade and board contamination issues have been
resolved and that we should return to more normal gross profit margins in future quarters. Our goal is to improve our margins
to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800, DVM-800 HD and FirstVU
HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial production in 2016 and beyond. In addition,
as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and
more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management
of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $5,275,212 and $4,180,559 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
an increase of $1,094,653 (26%). Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 122%
in 2016 compared to 82% in 2015. The significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:  

Research
and development expense.   We continue to focus on bringing new products to market, including updates and improvements to
current products. Our research and development expenses totaled $731,077 and $720,640 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $10,437 (1%). We employed a total of 29 engineers at September 30, 2016 compared to
24 engineers at September 30, 2015, most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products. We are
increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our offerings to include, among other items, cloud-based
evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring
and management tool (FleetVU). Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 17% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We have active research and development
projects on several new products, as well as upgrades to our existing product lines. We consider our research and development
capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis.  

Selling,
advertising and promotional expenses.   Selling, advertising and promotional expense totaled $1,369,244 and $1,175,498 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $193,746 (16%). Salesman salaries and commissions
represent the primary components of these costs and were $753,658 and $851,319 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, a decrease of $97,661 (11%). The effective commission rate was 17.4% at September 30, 2016 compared to 16.7%
at September 30, 2015. We hired additional territory salesmen during the last half of 2015, which contributed to the increased
effective commission rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Promotional
and advertising expenses totaled $615,586 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $324,179 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $291,407 (90%). The increase is primarily attributable to us becoming the title
sponsor in 2015 of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. This year it was held
August 1-7, 2016. We incurred net promotional expenses of $497,235 in the third quarter 2016 relative to this sponsorship compared
to $172,623 for the third quarter of 2015.  

Stock-based
compensation expense.   Stock based compensation expense totaled $422,246 and $479,084 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $56,838 (12%). The decrease is primarily due to the amortization of the restricted
stock granted during February 2015 to our officers and other employees that had the effect of increasing the stock compensation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 2016. Our general stock price was higher on the date of the
2015 stock grants compared to previous years, which increased the grant date fair value attributable to the restricted stock grants.  

Professional
fees and expense.   Professional fees and expenses totaled $432,325 and $259,512 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $172,813 (67%). The increase in professional fees and expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to higher litigation expenses related to the Utility, Taser
and WatchGuard lawsuits. We expect litigation expense to trend higher during the remainder of 2016 and 2017 as we commence the
jury trial in the Utility lawsuit and discovery activities in the Taser and WatchGuard lawsuits. We intend to pursue recovery
from Utility, Taser, WatchGuard, their insurers and other responsible parties as appropriate.  

Executive,
sales and administrative staff payroll.   Executive, sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled $1,641,014
and $830,379 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $810,635 (98%). This increase
is attributable to the need to hire additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because
our installed customer base has expanded and additional technical and marketing support was required for our new products, such
as the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD. Additionally, executive payroll increased over prior year levels as key employees and certain executives
received raises or bonuses after several years of salaries being frozen. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 a special
bonus of $630,000 was awarded to our CEO, which did not occur in the comparable period in 2015.  

Other  .
Other selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $679,306 and $715,446 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $36,140 (5%). The decrease in other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to decreased consulting, and contract labor expenses.  

Operating
Loss   

For
the reasons previously stated, our operating loss was $3,241,641 and $2,140,785 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, a deterioration of $1,100,856 (51%). Operating loss as a percentage of revenues increased to 75% in 2016
from 42% in 2015.  

Interest
Income   

Interest
income increased to $5,913 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4,430 in 2015.  

Change
in Warrant Derivative Liabilities   

Detachable
warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 398,916 common shares, as adjusted, were issued in conjunction with $2.0 million and
$4.0 million Secured Convertible Notes (the  Secured Convertible Notes ) during March and August 2014. The warrants
were required to be treated as derivative liabilities because of their anti-dilution and down-round provisions. Accordingly, we
estimated the fair value of such warrants as of their respective date of issuance and recorded a corresponding derivative liability
in the balance sheet. Upon exercise of the warrants we recognized a gain/loss based on the closing market price of the underlying
common stock on the date of exercise. In addition, the warrant derivative liability was adjusted to the estimated fair value of
any unexercised warrants as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. The warrant derivative liability balance was $2,186,214 and $67,053
as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively,  

The
changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants resulted in a gain of $89,645 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The changes in fair value of the warrant derivatives related to the unexercised warrants resulted
in a loss of $19,075 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The warrant derivative liability balance was $48,313 as of
September 30, 2016.  

Secured
Convertible Note Issuance Expenses   

We
elected to account for and record our Secured Convertible Notes payable on a fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to
expense the related issuance costs to other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Such costs totaled
$0 and $19,495 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Interest
Expense   

We
incurred interest expense of $776 and $74,958 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We issued
an aggregate of $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes during 2011, which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum
until the notes were paid in full on July 24, 2015.  

We
amortized to interest expense $0 and $60,224, representing the discount associated with the $2.5 million subordinated notes during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and the remaining unamortized discount was $0 at September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Loss
before Income Tax Benefit   

As
a result of the above, we reported a loss before income tax benefit of $3,255,579 and $2,141,163 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a deterioration of $1,114,416 (52%).  

Income
Tax Benefit    

We
recorded no income tax expense related to our income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to our overall net operating
loss carryforwards available. We have determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets
as of September 30, 2016 because we remain in a three-year cumulative tax loss position. During 2016, we increased our valuation
reserve on deferred tax assets by $3,110,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent operating
losses.  

We
had approximately $37,514,000 of net operating loss carryforwards and $1,822,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards
as of September 30, 2016 available to offset any future net taxable income.  

Net
Loss   

As
a result of the above, we reported a net loss of $3,255,579 and $2,141,163 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, a deterioration of $1,114,416 (52%).  

Basic
and Diluted Loss per Share   

The
basic and diluted loss per share was $0.61 and $0.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for
the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation
of diluted loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because of the net loss reported for each period.  

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Results
of Operations   

Summarized
immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub-sections is an analysis of our operating results for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, represented as a percentage of total revenues for each respective year:  

Revenues   

Revenues
for the nine months ended 2016 and 2015, respectively, were derived from the following sources:  

We
experienced a change in the sales mix of our products for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Our newer products, including the DVM-800 and the First VU HD, contributed 59% of total sales for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 55% for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015.  

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $13,128,881 and $14,979,089 respectively, a decrease of $1,850,208
(12%), due to the following factors:  

Our
    revenues decreased approximately 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September
    30, 2015. We attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by Taser s misleading press release regarding our patents
    combined with slower FirstVU HD sales while we resolved the PCB board contamination issues. We expect FirstVU HD sales to
    recover during the remainder of 2016 and we prosecute the patent lawsuits against Taser and WatchGuard. We believe the VuLink
    product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented
     auto-activation  technology.   

We
    shipped eight individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of $2,591,000 in revenue for the nine months ended September
    30, 2016 compared to seventeen of such individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of $3,000,000 in revenue for the
    nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our average order size decreased to approximately $2,860 in the nine months ended September
    30, 2016 from $2,900 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    

The
    DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, introduced in 2013, contributed 59% of total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
    to 55% for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015. We expect the sales mix will continue to migrate from the DVM-750
    product line to the newer products in 2016.    

Our
    international revenues increased to $1,154,412 (9% of total revenues) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
    to $114,413 (1% of total revenues) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our first quarter 2016 revenues marked
    the first increase over the prior period after a number of quarters of disappointing results. We generated revenues of $760,000
    from an international commercial customer in 2016 from the sale of our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems and extended
    service agreement. This order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our FirstVU HD body cameras across various industries
    and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement market.    

Cost
of Revenue   

Cost
of revenue on units sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $7,976,455 and $8,193,381, respectively, a
decrease of $216,926 (3%). The decrease in cost of goods sold is partially due to the 12% decrease in revenues offset by the workmanship
issues on our PCB boards affecting the FirstVU HD product that we became aware of during 2016. The workmanship issues resulted
in a higher than normal rate of contaminated PCB boards in our finished goods inventory as well as deployed units in the field.
The PCB boards were supplied by a contract manufacturer that did not follow our specifications regarding the flux used in the
soldering process for certain of the components utilized in the PCB board assemblies. We incurred total charges to cost of sales
approximating $650,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to this issue. These charges result from the disassembly
of the FirstVU HD, inspection of all PCB boards and replacement of PCB boards exhibiting contamination issues. Additionally, we
scrapped approximately $1,000,000 of cable assemblies and older versions of our products in the nine months ended September 30,
2016, which also increased our cost of revenues.  

Cost
of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 61% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 55% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. We believe our gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. Our
goal is to maintain cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at 40% or less during the remainder of 2016 and beyond.  

Gross
Profit   

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5,152,426 and $6,785,708, respectively, a decrease of $1,633,282
(24%). The decrease is commensurate with the 12% decrease in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cost of sales
as a percentage of revenues increasing to 61% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 55% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. We believe that gross margins will improve during the balance of 2016 because we have corrected the workmanship
and other issues affecting our FirstVU HD product during recent quarters, including the PCB contamination issue addressed in the
second and third quarters 2016. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of
our newer products, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase
commercial production in 2016. In addition, as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins
from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue
our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective
purchasing practices.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $13,624,619 and $11,706,650 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
an increase of $1,917,969 (16%). Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 104%
in 2016 from 78% in 2015. The significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:  

Research
and development expense.   We continue to focus on bringing new products to market, including updates and improvements to
current products. Our research and development expenses totaled $2,353,081 and $2,247,863 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $105,218 (5%). We employed a total of 29 engineers at September 30, 2016 compared
to 24 engineers at September 30, 2015, most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products. Research
and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 18% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 15%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We are increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our
offerings to include, among other items, cloud-based evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net)
and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU). We have active research and development projects
on several new products, as well as upgrades to our existing product lines. We consider our research and development capabilities
and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis.  

Selling,
advertising and promotional expenses.   Selling, advertising and promotional expense totaled $3,295,743 and $2,951,791 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $343,952 (12%). Salesman salaries and commissions
represent the primary components of these costs and were $2,358,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,293,233
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $65,512 (3%). The overall effective commission rate was 18.0% and
15.3% for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We hired additional territory salesmen during the last
half of 2015, which contributed to the increased effective commission rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Promotional
and advertising expenses totaled $936,998 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $658,558 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $278,440 (42%). The increase is primarily attributable to us becoming the title
sponsor in 2015 of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Our net promotional expense
related to sponsorship of the 2016 tournament was $499,271 compared to $172,623 for the 2015 tournament, an increase of $326,648.  

Stock-based
compensation expense.   Stock based compensation expense totaled $1,203,312 and $1,077,485 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $125,827 (12%). The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the restricted
stock granted during 2015 and 2016 to our officers and other employees that had the effect of increasing the stock compensation
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015. The total number of restricted shares granted and our market
stock price was higher on the specific dates of the 2015 and 2016 stock grants compared to previous years. This increased the
grant date fair value attributable to the restricted stock grants which is amortized to expense over their respective vesting
periods.  

Professional
fees and expense  . Professional fees and expenses totaled $1,487,657 and $980,144 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $507,513 (52%). The increase in professional fees and expenses in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to higher board of directors  fees and litigation expenses
related to the Utility, Taser, and WatchGuard lawsuits. We expect litigation expense to trend higher during the remainder of 2016
and 2017 as we commence the jury trial in the Utility lawsuit and discovery activities in the Taser and WatchGuard lawsuits. We
intend to pursue recovery from Utility, Taser, WatchGuard, their insurers and other responsible parties as appropriate.  

Executive,
sales and administrative staff payroll.   Executive, sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled $3,259,773
and $2,100,545 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,159,228 (55%). This increase
is attributable to the need to hire additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because
our installed customer base has expanded and additional technical and marketing support was required for our new products, such
as the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD. Additionally, executive payroll increased over prior year levels as key employees and certain executives
received raises or bonuses after several years of salaries being frozen. A special bonus of $630,000 was awarded to our CEO in
2016, which did not occur in the comparable period 2015.  

Other  .
Other selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,025,053 and $2,348,822 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $323,769 (14%). The decrease in other expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to decreased consulting, and contract labor expenses. We utilized consultants to help
design, develop and launch a new corporate website in 2015. Additionally, we converted several associates who were contract labor
in the technical support area in 2015 to full-time employees in 2016.  

Operating
Loss    

For
the reasons previously stated, our operating loss was $8,472,193 and $4,920,942 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, a deterioration of $3,551,251 (72%). Operating loss as a percentage of revenues deteriorated to 65% in 2016
compared to 33% in 2015.  

Interest
Income   

Interest
income increased to $22,103 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $12,573 in 2015.  

Change
in Warrant Derivative Liabilities   

Detachable
warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 398,916 common shares, as adjusted, were issued in conjunction with $2.0 million and
$4.0 million Secured Convertible Notes during March and August 2014. The warrants were required to be treated as derivative liabilities
because of their anti-dilution and down-round provisions. Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of such warrants as of their
respective date of issuance and recorded a corresponding derivative liability in the balance sheet. Upon exercise of the warrants
we recognized a gain/loss based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. In addition,
the warrant derivative liability is adjusted to the estimated fair value of any unexercised warrants as of September 30, 2016
and 2015. The warrant derivative liability balance was $2,186,214 and $67,053 as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively,  

The
holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised 212,295 of its warrants on March 24, 2015, with the change in value of the warrant
derivative through the date of the exercise resulting in a gain of $340,722 compared to the estimated warrant derivative balance.
The resulting derivative balance of $1,769,467 was offset against the warrant derivative liability during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised 37,800 of its warrants on April 9, 2015, with the change
in value of the warrant derivative through the date of the exercise resulting in a gain of $127,951 compared to the estimated
warrant derivative balance. The resulting derivative balance of $447,361 was offset against the warrant derivative liability during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The changes in fair value of the warrant derivatives related to the unexercised warrants
resulted in a loss of $175,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015, a loss of $11,890 for the three months ended June 30,
2015, and a gain of $89,645 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net change in warrant derivative liabilities resulted
in a gain of $371,428 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants resulted in a gain of $18,740 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The warrant derivative liability balance was $48,313 as of September 30, 2016.  

Change
in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Notes Payable   

We
elected to account for and record our $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note on its fair value basis. The holder of the $4.0 million
Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining principal balance of the note into 655,738 shares of common
stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest thereon at a conversion rate of $7.32 per share in separate transactions between February
13 and 25, 2015. The increase in fair market value of the 655,213 shares over the $3,963,780 principal retired was $4,434,383
representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion rate as of the conversion dates. Accordingly, the total change
in fair value of secured convertible notes payable was a $4,434,383 loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was
recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

The
Secured Convertible Note Payable was fully converted in 2015 so there were no changes in fair value in 2016.  

Secured
Convertible Notes Issuance Expenses   

We
elected to account for and record our secured convertible note payable on a fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to
expense the related issuance costs to other expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Such costs totaled
$0 and $93,845 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2015 expenses were attributable to the proxy costs incurred for
our Special Meeting of Shareholders held on February 13, 2015 to approve the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Cap.  

Other
Income (Expense)    

Other
income was $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,878 in 2015.  

Interest
Expense   

We
incurred interest expense of $2,438 and $280,972 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We issued an aggregate
of $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes during 2011, which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum until the
notes were paid in full on July 24, 2015. On August 28, 2014, we issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note bearing interest
at the rate of 6% per annum that remained outstanding until its full conversion in the first quarter 2015.  

We
amortized to interest expense $0 and $101,571, representing the discount associated with the $2.5 million subordinated note during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and the remaining unamortized discount was $0 at September 30,
2016 and 2015.  

Loss
before Income Tax Benefit   

As
a result of the above, we reported a loss before income tax benefit of $8,433,788 and $9,344,263 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an improvement of $910,475 (10%).  

Income
Tax Benefit    

We
recorded no income tax expense related to our loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to our overall net operating
loss carryforwards available. We have determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets
as of September 30, 2016 because we remain in a three-year cumulative tax loss position. During 2016, we increased our valuation
reserve on deferred tax assets by $3,110,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent operating
losses.  

We
had approximately $37,514,000 of net operating loss carryforwards and $1,822,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards
as of September 30, 2016 available to offset any future net taxable income.  

Net
Loss    

As
a result of the above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of $8,433,788 and $9,344,263
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an improvement of $910,475 (10%).  

Basic
and Diluted Loss per Share    

The
basic and diluted loss per share was $1.59 and $2.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for
the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation
of diluted loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Overall:

On
July 22, 2015, we closed a $12.0 million offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants in an at-the-market registered
direct offering and a concurrent private placement of two series of common stock purchase warrants with two investors. Proceeds
of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes plus accrued interest in full and for
working capital purposes.  

We
believe we may have to supplement our liquidity to support our operations for the remainder of 2016 and 2017, given our recent
history of net operating losses and negative cash flows. We do not believe that traditional banking indebtedness will be available
to us given our recent operating history, however the Company has outstanding warrants to acquire approximately 1,600,000 common
shares with a weighted average exercise price of $13.26. Such warrants could be utilized to provide near-term liquidity and the
Company may undertake a strategy to induce their holders to exercise their warrants by adjusting/lowering the exercise price on
a temporary or permanent basis. The Company has had preliminary discussions with the two primary warrant holders in that regard.
Based on such discussions, we believe that our strategy to induce the exercise of all or a portion of the outstanding warrants
could be a viable strategy should the Company need to supplement its near-term liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to induce the exercise of outstanding warrants and what terms/inducement may be required to successfully
induce the holders to exercise such warrants. Ultimately, the Company must restore profitable operations and positive cash flows
in order to provide liquidity to support its operations and, if necessary, to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms in
2017 and beyond. In addition, if the need arises, we may seek commercial credit facilities, including traditional bank borrowings,
to improve our liquidity position and to finance growth opportunities or future capital needs that may arise.  

We
have warrants outstanding exercisable to purchase 1,599,290 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price $13.26
per share outstanding as of September 30, 2016. In addition, there are common stock purchase options outstanding covering 365,190
shares at an average price of $18.35 per share. The exercise of these common stock equivalents would provide us with an additional
potential source of liquidity if and when they are exercised.  

We
had $1,815,699 of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of approximately $11.7 million as of September 30, 2016.
Net working capital as of September 30, 2016 includes approximately $2.5 million of accounts receivable and $10.4 million of inventory.  

Cash
and cash equivalents balances:  As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $1,815,699,
a decrease from a balance of $6,924,079 at December 31, 2015. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the
subsequent subsections are the main elements of the $5,108,380 net decrease in cash during the nine months ended September 30,
2016:  

Operating
    activities :  
       $4,726,611
     of net  cash used in  operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $4,726,611 and $7,031,956 for
    the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an improvement of $2,305,345. The improvement was primarily
    the result of our net loss being less in 2016 along with decreases in accounts receivable, and increases in deferred revenue,
    accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our goal is to increase revenues, return to profitability and decrease our inventory
    levels during the remainder of 2016, thereby providing positive cash flows from operations, although there can be no assurances
    that we will be successful in this regard.   

Investing
    activities :  
       $373,907
     of net  cash used in  investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $373,907 for the nine months ended
    September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $1,105,226 for the nine months ended September 30,
    2015. In 2016, we incurred costs for tooling of new products and for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized
    in our new products and included in intangible assets. In 2015, we incurred costs for new work stations and computers for
    recently hired associates. In connection with the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note issued in August 2014, we were required
    to maintain a minimum cash balance of not less than $1.5 million until such time as we satisfied all of the  Equity
    Conditions,  as defined in the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note (see Note 5). We satisfied the  Equity Conditions 
    on February 13, 2015 and the restriction on the $1.5 million was lifted and the funds became available for working capital.

Financing
    activities   
       $7,862
     of net  cash used in  financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $7,862 for the nine months ended
    September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $10,689,775 for the nine months ended September 30,
    2015. We received $19,055 of proceeds in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the exercise of common stock warrants
    and options compared to $2,133,889 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On July 22, 2015 we closed a $12.0 million
    offering of the Company s common stock and common stock purchase warrants. After placement agent fees and other estimated
    offering expenses, the net offering proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $11.2 million prior to any exercise of the
    warrants. Proceeds of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of the subordinated notes. We paid
    $93,845 of debt issuance costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the $2.0 million Secured Convertible
    Note. During 2015 we acquired capital equipment financed through capital lease obligations and payments on such obligations
    represented the cash used in financing activities.    

The
net result of these activities was a decrease in cash of $5,108,380 to $1,815,699 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Commitments:

We
had $1,815,699 of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating $11.7 million as of September
30, 2016. Accounts receivable balances represented $2,517,518 of our net working capital at September 30, 2016. We intend to collect
our outstanding receivables on a timely basis during 2016, which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations
during the balance of 2016. Inventory represented $10,412,276 of our net working capital at September 30, 2016 and finished goods
represented $7,452,101 of total inventory. We are actively managing the level of inventory and our goal is to reduce such levels
during the balance of 2016 by our sales activities, which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during
2016.  

Capital
Expenditures .  We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at September 30, 2016.  

Lease
Commitments-Operating Leases.   We have a non-cancelable long term operating lease agreement for office and warehouse space
that expires during April 2020. We have also entered into month-to-month leases for equipment. Rent expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $298,293 and $302,414, respectively, related to these leases.  

Following
are our minimum lease payments for each year and in total.  

License
agreements.   We have several license agreements under which we have been assigned the rights to certain materials used
in its products. Certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing
the licensed material on a quarterly basis. Royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated $18,911 and $19,957 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Litigation.

The
Company is subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no assurances,
based on the information currently available, management believes that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the
actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. However, an adverse outcome
in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company in the period in which
it is recorded.  

On
October 25, 2013, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to eliminate threats
by a competitor, Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility ), of alleged patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,831,556
(the    556 Patent ). Specifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that the Company s mobile video surveillance
systems do not infringe any claim of the  556 Patent. The Company became aware that Utility had mailed letters to current
and prospective purchasers of its mobile video surveillance systems threatening that the use of such systems purchased from third
parties not licensed to the  556 Patent would create liability for them for patent infringement. The Company rejects Utility s
assertion and will vigorously defend the right of end-users to purchase such systems from providers other than Utility. The United
States District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the lawsuit because it decided that Kansas was not the proper jurisdictional
forum for the dispute. The District Court s decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case. The Company appealed the
decision and the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court s previous decision.  

In
addition, the Company began proceedings to invalidate the  556 Patent through a request for  inter partes review  of
the  556 patent at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ). On July 27, 2015, the USPTO invalidated
key claims in Utility s  556 Patent. The Final Decision from the USPTO significantly curtails Utility s ability
to threaten law enforcement agencies, municipalities, and others with infringement of the  556 Patent. Utility has appealed
this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The parties are briefing their respective positions
to the Federal Circuit, and briefing is expected to be completed by approximately fourth quarter 2016, at which time oral argument
will be scheduled by the Federal Circuit. The Company believes that Utility will have a difficult time convincing the appellate
court to overturn the decision of the USPTO.  

On
September 4, 2014 the Company filed an Unfair Competition lawsuit against Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility ) in
the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the lawsuit it contends that Utility has defamed the Company and
illegally interfered with its contracts, customer relationships and business expectancies by falsely asserting to its customers
and others that its products violate the  556 Patent, of which Utility claims to be the holder.  

The
suit also includes claims against Utility for tortious interference with contract and violation of the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets
Act (KUSTA), arising out of Utility s employment of the Company s employees, in violation of that employee s
Non-Competition and Confidentiality agreements with the Company. In addition to damages, the Company seeks temporary, preliminary,
and permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting Utility from, among other things, continuing to threaten or otherwise interfere with
the Company s customers. On March 4, 2015, an initial hearing was held upon the Company s request for injunctive relief.  

Based
upon facts revealed at the March 4, 2015 hearing, on March 16, 2015, the Company sought leave to amend its Complaint in the Kansas
suit to assert additional claims against Utility. Those new claims include claims of actual or attempted monopolization, in violation
of   2 of the Sherman Act, claims arising under a new Georgia statute that prohibits threats of patent infringement in  bad
faith,  and additional claims of unfair competition/false advertising in violation of   63(a) of the Lanham Act. As
these statutes expressly provide, the Company will seek treble damages, punitive damages and attorneys  fees as well as
injunctive relief. The Court concluded its hearing on April 22, 2015, and allowed the Company leave to amend its complaint, but
denied its preliminary injunction. The discovery stage of the lawsuit expired in May 2016 and summary judgment motions have been
filed by both parties which are currently under review and consideration by the court. The jury trial date is scheduled for June
2017 should the parties not settle the matter. The Company believes that the USPTO s final decision issued on July 27, 2015
will provide it with substantial basis to pursue the Company s claims either through summary judgment motions prior to trial
or the jury trial itself and it intends to pursue recovery from Utility, its insurers and other parties, as appropriate.  

On
September 13, 2014, Utility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company
alleging infringement of the  556 Patent. The suit was served on the Company on September 20, 2014. As alleged in the Company s
first filed lawsuit described above, the Company believes that the  556 Patent is both invalid and not infringed. Further,
the USPTO has issued its final decision invalidating 23 of the 25 claims asserted in the  556 Patent, as noted above. The
Company believes that the suit filed by Utility is without merit and is vigorously defending the claims asserted against the Company.
An adverse resolution of the foregoing litigation or patent proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Court stayed all proceedings with respect
to this lawsuit pending the outcome of the patent review performed by the USPTO and the appellate court. Based on the USPTO s
final decision to invalidate substantially all claims contained in the  556 Patent, the Company intends to file for summary
judgment in its favor if Utility does not request outright dismissal.  

The
Company received notice in April 2015 that Taser, one of the Company s competitors, had commenced an action in the USPTO
for a re-examination of its U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (the    292 Patent). A re-examination is essentially a request
that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the  prior art,  e.g.,
other patents in the same technology field. The prior art used by Taser to request the re-examination is a patent application
(which never issued into a patent) assigned to an unrelated third party and was not the result of any of Taser s own research
and development efforts.  

The
Company owns the  292 Patent, which is directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement
officer s body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and automatically instructs other recording devices to
begin recording. The technology described in the  292 Patent is incorporated in the Company s VuLink product.  

On
August 17, 2015 the USPTO issued a first, non-final action rejecting all 20 claims of the  292 Patent respecting its  292
Patent under an  ex parte  re-examination. The Company was provided the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art
and the scope of the patent claims with the patent Examiner handling the reexamination and to amend the patent claims. On January
14, 2016 the USPTO ultimately rejected Taser s efforts and confirmed the validity of the  292 Patent with 59 claims
covering various aspects of the Company s auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the USPTO issued another patent
relating to the Company s auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the  
 452 Patent ) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response
to a triggering event such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.  

The
Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against
Taser, alleging willful patent infringement against Taser s Axon body camera product line. The lawsuit was initiated after
the USPTO reconfirmed the validity of the  292 Patent, which covers various aspects of auto-activation and multiple camera
coordination for body-worn cameras and in-car video systems. The  292 Patent previously was subject to attack by Taser,
which tried to invalidate it at the USPTO. The USPTO ultimately rejected Taser s efforts and confirmed the validity of the
 292 Patent with 59 claims covering various aspects of this valuable auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the
USPTO issued another patent relating to the Company s auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. This  452
Patent generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event
such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle. The Company added the  452 patent to its existing
lawsuit against Taser seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Taser for infringement of both the  452
and  292 Patents.  

In
addition to the infringement claims, the Company added a new set of claims to the lawsuit alleging that Taser conspired to keep
the Company out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical, and unfair competition. The amended lawsuit alleges Taser
bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal
antitrust law. The Company s lawsuit also seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including treble damages, for these alleged
violations.  

The
Company filed an amended complaint and Taser filed an answer which denied the patent infringement allegations on April 1, 2016.
In addition, Taser filed a motion to dismiss all allegations in the complaint on March 4, 2016 for which the Company filed an
amended complaint on March 18, 2016 to address certain technical deficiencies in the pleadings. Taser amended and renewed its
motion to seek dismissal of the allegations that it had bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for
its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law on April 1, 2016. Formal discovery commenced on April 12,
2016 with respect to the patent related claims. The Company won its motion to commence discovery on the bribery related claims,
which discovery commenced in October 2016. The Court has yet to rule on Taser s motion to dismiss the portion of the lawsuit
regarding claims that it had bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation
of both state law and federal antitrust law.  

On
May 27, 2016 the Company filed suit against Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video ( WatchGuard ), alleging
patent infringement based on WatchGuard s VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines. The Company filed the suit in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas.  

The
USPTO has granted multiple patents to the Company with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically and simultaneously
activating all deployed cameras in response to the activation of just one camera. Additionally, Digital Ally s patent claims
cover automatic coordination as well as digital synchronization between multiple recording devices. Digital Ally also has patent
coverage directed to the coordination between a multi-camera system and an officer s smartphone, which allows an officer
to more readily assess an event on the scene while an event is taking place or immediately after it has occurred.  

The
Company s lawsuit alleges that WatchGuard incorporated this patented technology into its VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product
lines without its permission. Specifically, Digital Ally is accusing WatchGuard of infringing three patents: the  292 and
 452 Patents and U.S. Patent No. 9,325,950. The Company is aggressively challenging WatchGuard s infringing conduct,
seeking both monetary damages, as well as seeking a permanent injunction preventing WatchGuard from continuing to sell its VISTA
Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines using Digital Ally s own technology to compete against it. The lawsuit is in the early
stage of discovery.  

The
Company is also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental
to its business from time to time, including customer collections, vendor and employment-related matters. The Company believes
the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to its business or its financial condition.  

Sponsorship.
  On April 16, 2015 the Company entered into a Title Sponsorship Agreement (the  Agreement ) under which it
became the title sponsor for a Web.com Tour golf tournament (the  Tournament ) held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan
area. The Agreement provides the Company with naming rights and other benefits for the annual Tournament for the years 2015 through
2019 in exchange for the following sponsorship fee:  

The
Company has the right to sell and retain the proceeds from the sale of additional sponsorships, including but not limited to,
a presenting sponsorship, a concert sponsorship and founding partnerships for the Tournament. The Company recorded net sponsorship
expenses of $497,235 and $172,623 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $499,271 and $172,623
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such net sponsorship expense includes the sponsorship fee
and other costs related to the 2015 and 2016 Tournaments that have been completed.  

Stock
Repurchase Program  . On August 25, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a program that authorizes the repurchase of up
to $2.5 million of the Company s common stock in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases,
if and when made, will be subject to market conditions, applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other factors.
The repurchase program will be funded using a portion of cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flow from operations. Purchases
may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company had not repurchased any shares under this program as of September
30, 2016.  

401(k)
Plan.   In July 2008, the Company amended and restated its 401(k) retirement savings plan. The amended plan requires the
Company to provide 100% matching contributions for employees who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan
and 50% matching contributions for employee s elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. The Company has
made matching contributions totaling $46,346 and $47,220 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $135,058 and $121,920 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested
at all times in employee and employer matching contributions.  

Consulting
and Distributor Agreements.   The Company has entered into two agreements that require it to make monthly payments which
will be applied to future commissions and/or consulting fees to be earned by the provider:  

The
    first agreement is with an individual who provides consulting services for international sales opportunities for both our
    law enforcement and commercial product lines primarily in Europe. This individual is paid a monthly fee ranging from $4,000
    to $6,000 per month plus necessary and reasonable expenses for a period of one year beginning March 23, 2016, which can be
    extended by mutual agreement of the parties. In addition to the monthly fee, the provider can earn a success fee based upon
    the amount of sales generated by his activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had advanced a total of $39,781 pursuant
    to this agreement.    

The
    second agreement is with a limited liability company ( LLC ) that is partially owned by a relative of the Company s
    chief financial officer. Under the agreement, dated January 15, 2016, the LLC provides consulting services for developing
    a new distribution channel outside of law enforcement for its body-worn camera and related cloud storage products to customers
    in the United States. The Company pays the LLC an advance against commissions ranging from $5,000 to $6,000 per month plus
    necessary and reasonable expenses for a period of one year beginning January 2016, which agreement can be automatically extended
    based on the LLC achieving certain minimum sales quotas. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had advanced a total of $123,459
    pursuant to this agreement.    

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1,  Financial
Statements , of this report. While the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective
judgments and estimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements, potentially
involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application, and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing
conditions:  

Revenue
    Recognition / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts;   

Allowance
    for Excess and Obsolete Inventory;   

Warranty
    Reserves;   

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense; and   

Accounting
    for Income Taxes; and   

Determination
    of Fair Value Calculation for Financial Instruments and Derivatives.   

Revenue
Recognition / Allowances for Doubtful Accounts.   Revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service
when all four of the following conditions are met:  

(i)  
      Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists;   

(ii)  
      Delivery
    has occurred;   

(iii)  
      The
    price is fixed or determinable; and   

(iv)  
      Collectability
    is reasonably assured.   

We
review all significant, unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting
and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements. Extended warranties are offered on selected products
and when a customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over
the term of the extended warranty.  

Our
principal customers are state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, which historically have been low risks for uncollectible
accounts. However, we do have commercial customers and international distributors that present a greater risk for uncollectible
accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances.
Our historical bad debts have been negligible, with less than $198,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of
$198.9 million since we commenced deliveries during 2006. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had provided a reserve
for doubtful accounts of $70,000 and $74,997, respectively.  

We
periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility.
Based on such review, we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of September 30, 2016. However, if the balance
due from any significant customer ultimately become uncollectible, then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to
cover the charge-off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations.  

Allowance
for Excess and Obsolete Inventory.   We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory
items. The amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management performs an analysis of the underlying
inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence. Management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves
based on this analysis. In addition, we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is
below its cost.  

Inventories
consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

We
balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the
risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, our inventory reserves
represented 12.3% of the gross inventory balance at September 30, 2016, compared to 10.1% of the gross inventory balance at December
31, 2015. We had $1,455,458 and $1,202,411 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $4,168,866 and $3,833,873 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively, an increase of $334,993 (9%). The increase in raw materials was mostly in refurbished parts for FirstVU
HD products. Finished goods balances were $7,452,101 and $7,895,663 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
a decrease of $443,562 (6%). The decrease in finished goods was primarily in DVM-750 and FirstVU HD products. Finished goods at
September 30, 2016 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products, and our DVM-750 products for expected orders. The increase in
the inventory reserve is due to the change in sales mix of our products, which has resulted in a higher level of excess component
parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the established reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels
at September 30, 2016.  

If
actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes
to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in excess
of the inventory reserves already established.  

Warranty
Reserves.   We generally provide up to a two-year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers. Provisions
for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using
historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims. We actively study trends of claims and take action
to improve product quality and minimize claims. Our warranty reserves were increased to $227,459 as of September 30, 2016 compared
to $159,838 as of December 31, 2015 primarily for expected replacements associated with extended batteries for select FirstVU
HD customers. We will monitor our reserve for the warranty claims related to our FirstVU HD and DVM-800 products. There is a risk
that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims for such products than our history has indicated
on our legacy mirror products on our new products for which we have limited experience. Actual experience could differ from the
amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods.  

Stock-based
Compensation Expense .   We grant stock options to our employees and
directors and such benefits provided are share-based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to
determining the value of our share-based compensation. Our expected stock-price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities
of the underlying stock that are obtained from public data sources and there were 40,000 stock options granted during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.   

If
factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense that we record in the future may
differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. There is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using
option pricing models to estimate share-based compensation. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
our estimates of fair values of our share-based compensation. Certain share-based payment awards, such as employee stock options,
may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant
date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly
in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Although the fair
value of employee share-based awards is determined using an established option pricing model, that value may not be indicative
of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.  

In
addition, we are required to net estimated forfeitures against compensation expense. This requires us to estimate the number of
awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures in future periods are different than our initial estimate,
the compensation expense that we ultimately record may differ significantly from what was originally estimated. The estimated
forfeiture rate for unvested options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 range from 0% to 10%.  

Accounting
for Income Taxes.    Accounting for income taxes requires significant
estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective
tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income
in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood
that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.   

As
required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected
to reverse. Authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2015, cumulative valuation
allowances in the amount of $18,105,000 were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets. Based on a review
of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to
$21,215,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016. We determined that it was appropriate to continue
to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 because of the overall net operating
loss carryforwards available. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain
a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization
of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation
allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions
for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders  equity.  

As
required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance
with recognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position
taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax
expense for financial reporting purposes. We have no recorded liability as of September 30, 2016 representing uncertain tax positions.  

We
have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense
taken for stock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax
benefit of these assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income
tax purposes. In some cases, where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability
to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options
have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised. In assessing whether a valuation allowance
is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income
in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded
deferred income tax asset balances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no additional
tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability
to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in
future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.  

Determination
of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives.    During
2014 in two separate transactions the Company issued a total of $6.0 million of secured convertible notes with detachable warrants
to purchase common stock. The Company elected to record the secured convertible notes on their fair value basis. In addition,
the warrants to purchase common stock contained anti-dilution provisions that required them to be accounted for as derivative
liabilities. Management was required to determine the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding as of the December
31, 2014 for financial reporting purposes.   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 820    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), the Company utilizes
the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets
or liabilities, such as a business.  

ASC
820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
    1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   

Level
    2   Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities)   

Level
    3   Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value)   

The
following table represents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of September 30, 2016.  

Inflation
and Seasonality    

Inflation
has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature; however,
generally we generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year than in the first half.

4. Controls and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of such disclosure controls and procedures for this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2016 to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in this report was recorded,
processed, summarized and communicated to the Company s management as appropriate and within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during its last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect its internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

The
Company is subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no assurances,
based on the information currently available, management believes that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the
actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. However, an adverse outcome
in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company in the period in which
it is recorded.  

On
October 25, 2013, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to eliminate threats
by a competitor, Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility ), of alleged patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,831,556
(the    556 Patent ). Specifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that the Company s mobile video surveillance
systems do not infringe any claim of the  556 Patent. The Company became aware that Utility had mailed letters to current
and prospective purchasers of its mobile video surveillance systems threatening that the use of such systems purchased from third
parties not licensed to the  556 Patent would create liability for them for patent infringement. The Company rejects Utility s
assertion and will vigorously defend the right of end-users to purchase such systems from providers other than Utility. The United
States District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the lawsuit because it decided that Kansas was not the proper jurisdictional
forum for the dispute. The District Court s decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case. The Company appealed the
decision and the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court s previous decision.  

In
addition, the Company began proceedings to invalidate the  556 Patent through a request for  inter partes review  of
the  556 patent at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ). On July 27, 2015, the USPTO invalidated
key claims in Utility s  556 Patent. The Final Decision from the USPTO significantly curtails Utility s ability
to threaten law enforcement agencies, municipalities, and others with infringement of the  556 Patent. Utility has appealed
this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The parties are briefing their respective positions
to the Federal Circuit, and briefing is expected to be completed by approximately fourth quarter 2016, at which time oral argument
will be scheduled by the Federal Circuit. The Company believes that Utility will have a difficult time convincing the appellate
court to overturn the decision of the USPTO.  

On
September 4, 2014 the Company filed an Unfair Competition lawsuit against Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility ) in
the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the lawsuit it contends that Utility has defamed the Company and
illegally interfered with its contracts, customer relationships and business expectancies by falsely asserting to its customers
and others that its products violate the  556 Patent, of which Utility claims to be the holder.  

The
suit also includes claims against Utility for tortious interference with contract and violation of the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets
Act (KUSTA), arising out of Utility s employment of the Company s employees, in violation of that employee s
Non-Competition and Confidentiality agreements with the Company. In addition to damages, the Company seeks temporary, preliminary,
and permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting Utility from, among other things, continuing to threaten or otherwise interfere with
the Company s customers. On March 4, 2015, an initial hearing was held upon the Company s request for injunctive relief.  

Based
upon facts revealed at the March 4, 2015 hearing, on March 16, 2015, the Company sought leave to amend its Complaint in the Kansas
suit to assert additional claims against Utility. Those new claims include claims of actual or attempted monopolization, in violation
of   2 of the Sherman Act, claims arising under a new Georgia statute that prohibits threats of patent infringement in  bad
faith,  and additional claims of unfair competition/false advertising in violation of   63(a) of the Lanham Act. As
these statutes expressly provide, the Company will seek treble damages, punitive damages and attorneys  fees as well as
injunctive relief. The Court concluded its hearing on April 22, 2015, and allowed the Company leave to amend its complaint, but
denied its preliminary injunction. The discovery stage of the lawsuit expired in May 2016 and summary judgment motions have been
filed by both parties which are currently under review and consideration by the court. The jury trial date is scheduled for June
2017 should the parties not settle the matter. The Company believes that the USPTO s final decision issued on July 27, 2015
will provide it with substantial basis to pursue the Company s claims either through summary judgment motions prior to trial
or the jury trial itself and it intends to pursue recovery from Utility, its insurers and other parties, as appropriate.  

On
September 13, 2014, Utility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Company
alleging infringement of the  556 Patent. The suit was served on the Company on September 20, 2014. As alleged in the Company s
first filed lawsuit described above, the Company believes that the  556 Patent is both invalid and not infringed. Further,
the USPTO has issued its final decision invalidating 23 of the 25 claims asserted in the  556 Patent, as noted above. The
Company believes that the suit filed by Utility is without merit and is vigorously defending the claims asserted against the Company.
An adverse resolution of the foregoing litigation or patent proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Court stayed all proceedings with respect
to this lawsuit pending the outcome of the patent review performed by the USPTO and the appellate court. Based on the USPTO s
final decision to invalidate substantially all claims contained in the  556 Patent, the Company intends to file for summary
judgment in its favor if Utility does not request outright dismissal.  

The
Company received notice in April 2015 that Taser, one of the Company s competitors, had commenced an action in the USPTO
for a re-examination of its U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (the    292 Patent). A re-examination is essentially a request
that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the  prior art,  e.g.,
other patents in the same technology field. The prior art used by Taser to request the re-examination is a patent application
(which never issued into a patent) assigned to an unrelated third party and was not the result of any of Taser s own research
and development efforts.  

The
Company owns the  292 Patent, which is directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement
officer s body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and automatically instructs other recording devices to
begin recording. The technology described in the  292 Patent is incorporated in the Company s VuLink product.  

On
August 17, 2015 the USPTO issued a first, non-final action rejecting all 20 claims of the  292 Patent respecting its  292
Patent under an  ex parte  re-examination. The Company was provided the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art
and the scope of the patent claims with the patent Examiner handling the reexamination and to amend the patent claims. On January
14, 2016 the USPTO ultimately rejected Taser s efforts and confirmed the validity of the  292 Patent with 59 claims
covering various aspects of the Company s auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the USPTO issued another patent
relating to the Company s auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the  
 452 Patent ) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response
to a triggering event such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.  

The
Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against
Taser, alleging willful patent infringement against Taser s Axon body camera product line. The lawsuit was initiated after
the USPTO reconfirmed the validity of the  292 Patent, which covers various aspects of auto-activation and multiple camera
coordination for body-worn cameras and in-car video systems. The  292 Patent previously was subject to attack by Taser,
which tried to invalidate it at the USPTO. The USPTO ultimately rejected Taser s efforts and confirmed the validity of the
 292 Patent with 59 claims covering various aspects of this valuable auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the
USPTO issued another patent relating to the Company s auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. This  452
Patent generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event
such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle. The Company added the  452 patent to its existing
lawsuit against Taser seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Taser for infringement of both the  452
and  292 Patents.  

In
addition to the infringement claims, the Company added a new set of claims to the lawsuit alleging that Taser conspired to keep
the Company out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical, and unfair competition. The amended lawsuit alleges Taser
bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal
antitrust law. The Company s lawsuit also seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including treble damages, for these alleged
violations.  

The
Company filed an amended complaint and Taser filed an answer which denied the patent infringement allegations on April 1, 2016.
In addition, Taser filed a motion to dismiss all allegations in the complaint on March 4, 2016 for which the Company filed an
amended complaint on March 18, 2016 to address certain technical deficiencies in the pleadings. Taser amended and renewed its
motion to seek dismissal of the allegations that it had bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for
its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law on April 1, 2016. Formal discovery commenced on April 12,
2016 with respect to the patent related claims. The Company won its motion to commence discovery on the bribery related claims,
which discovery commenced in October 2016. The Court has yet to rule on Taser s motion to dismiss the portion of the lawsuit
regarding claims that it had bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation
of both state law and federal antitrust law.  

On
May 27, 2016 the Company filed suit against Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video ( WatchGuard ), alleging
patent infringement based on WatchGuard s VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines. The Company filed the suit in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas.  

The
USPTO has granted multiple patents to the Company with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically and simultaneously
activating all deployed cameras in response to the activation of just one camera. Additionally, Digital Ally s patent claims
cover automatic coordination as well as digital synchronization between multiple recording devices. Digital Ally also has patent
coverage directed to the coordination between a multi-camera system and an officer s smartphone, which allows an officer
to more readily assess an event on the scene while an event is taking place or immediately after it has occurred.  

The
Company s lawsuit alleges that WatchGuard incorporated this patented technology into its VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product
lines without its permission. Specifically, Digital Ally is accusing WatchGuard of infringing three patents: the  292 and
 452 Patents and U.S. Patent No. 9,325,950. The Company is aggressively challenging WatchGuard s infringing conduct,
seeking both monetary damages, as well as seeking a permanent injunction preventing WatchGuard from continuing to sell its VISTA
Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines using Digital Ally s own technology to compete against it. The lawsuit is in the early
stage of discovery.  

The
Company is also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental
to its business from time to time, including customer collections, vendor and employment-related matters. The Company believes
the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to its business or its financial condition.
