NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PERSENTATION 

Organization and nature of business  

PetroGas Company (Formerly America Resources Exploration Inc. (the  Company )), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 24, 2014. The Company was incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. and changed its name to America Resources Exploration Inc. on April 17, 2015.  Subsequently, on January 20, 2016, the Company changed its name to PetroGas Company.  On June 12, 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of working interests in certain oil   gas properties as discussed in Note 4 below. 

On April 16, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by increasing the Company's authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million and increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share held.   

On January 20, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the  Nevada SOS ) whereby decreasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. The Company s Board of Directors approved this amendment on January 13, 2016 and shareholders holding 68.65% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on January 14, 2016.  

All share and per share amounts in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this stock split. 

Financial Statements Presented 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 210 8-03 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2016. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period s financial statements to conform to the current period s presentation. 

NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN 

The Company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated revenue from operations, we will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. 

The financial statements have, in management s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below: 

Basis of Consolidation 

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 94% owned subsidiary, Seabourn Oil Company, LLC.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Fiscal Year End  

The Company has selected March 31 as its fiscal year end.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of commercial accounts and interest-bearing bank deposits and are carried at cost, which approximates current value. Items are considered to be cash equivalents if the original maturity is three months or less. 

Equipment and Facilities 

Equipment and facilities are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from one to twenty-five years. 

Intangible Assets  

Acquired intangible assets are recognized at cost and are classified as assets with finite useful lives. The Company amortizes the intangible assets with five years using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets. Intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment to determine if current circumstances and market conditions indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

Oil and Gas Properties   Full Cost Method 

The Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on nonproducing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to operations. 

The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense using the units-of-production method based on estimated proved recoverable oil and gas reserves.

(Unaudited) 

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Oil and Gas Properties   Full Cost Method (Cont d) 

The costs associated with unevaluated and unproved properties, initially excluded from the amortization base, relate to unproved leasehold acreage, wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of the existence of proved reserves, together with capitalized interest costs for these projects. Unproved leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well once a determination of the existence of proved reserves has been made or upon impairment of a lease. Costs associated with wells in progress and completed wells that have yet to be evaluated are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry wells are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful. 

All items classified as unproved property are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and become subject to amortization. 

Under full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties, including asset retirement costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the "cost ceiling") equal to the sum of (a) the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves, based on current prices and operating conditions, discounted at ten percent (10%), plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to operations.  For purposes of the ceiling test calculation, current prices are defined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period.  Prices are adjusted for basis or location differentials.  Unless sales contracts specify otherwise, prices are held constant for the productive life of each well.  Similarly, current costs are assumed to remain constant over the entire calculation period. 

The Company s proved properties have not operated for in excess of two years and under present circumstances, cannot be placed on production. Given the decline and continuing volatility of oil and gas prices which has prevented the Company from bringing its proven wells online, an estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves is indeterminable. In addition, development of the Company s unproved properties in not viable, nor are revenues from the Company s ORR s. As a result, the Company has evaluated its proved and unproven assets as at March 31, 2016 and has fully impaired these assets.  We recognized a cumulative total of $713,550 and $0 of impairment costs during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively in respect of our proven and unproven oil and gas assets, in addition to a total of $46,237 which was impaired during the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the loss on acquisition of certain ORR s. 

Impairment 

FASB ASC 360-10-35-21 requires that assets to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Oil and gas properties accounted for using the full cost method of accounting (which the Company uses) are excluded from this requirement but continue to be subject to the full cost method's impairment rules.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Revenue Recognition  

Oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by the Company in oil and gas properties. Sales of oil and gas produced from oil and gas operations are recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and title transfers to the purchaser. Charges for gathering and transportation are included in production expenses.  The Company had no sales of oil and gas during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Company records a liability for asset retirement obligations ("ARO") associated with its oil and gas wells when those assets are placed in service. The corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset and included in the carrying amount of oil and gas properties and is depleted over the useful life of the properties. Subsequently, the ARO liability is accreted to its then-present value. 

Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level 1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  

Level 2- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  

Level 3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information,  

The carrying value of all assets and liabilities approximated their fair values as of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company follows the guidance included in ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ) using the modified prospective transition method. The Company recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740,  Income Taxes  . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statements and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known. The estimates on depreciation were based on the estimated useful lives of the Company's assets. Any estimates during the period have had an immaterial effect on earnings. 

Earnings or Loss Per Share 

In accordance with ASC Topic 280    Earnings Per Share , the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

NOTE 4  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES 

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 the Company entered into certain agreements whereunder they acquired 94% control of Seabourn Oil Company, LLC, a company that holds a100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in a total of 960 acres located in two tracts in Callahan County, Texas.   

On June 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) where under it acquired the rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas, consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the  Leases ).   

Further, on June 11, 2015 the Company entered into additional assignment agreements for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding royalty interests ( ORR s ) in various counties in Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. 

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company completed various workovers and other improvements to certain of its existing wellbores, which amounts totaling $53,687 were capitalized under Proved Properties.  As at the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company expensed these costs as the Company has not yet determined when the wells will be brought online.  Further a total of $211,363 in proven and unproven oil and gas assets acquired as set out above, including ORR s were fully impaired at March 31, 2016 following an evaluation by the Company s management which determined recovery of costs was not likely to occur during the foreseeable future as a result of current industry economics.

NOTE 5   ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 

The Company has asset retirement obligations for any wells that are permanently removed from service. The primary obligations involve the removal and disposal of surface equipment, plugging and abandoning the wells and site restoration. For the purpose of determining the fair value of ARO incurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company used the following assumptions. 

Inflation Rate 

3% 

Estimated asset life 

20 years 

Credit adjusted risk free interest rate 

18% 

As at March 31, 2016, the Company determined to fully impair its shut in wells given a lack of production over a period in excess of two years, and the uncertainty in returning the wells to production in the future.  As a result, the Company has recorded a long term liability equal to the full value of the ARO. 

The following table shows the change in the Company s ARO during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016: 

NOTE 6   INCOME TAXES 

The Company estimates its annual effective income tax rate in recording its quarterly provision for income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Statutory tax rate changes and other significant or unusual items are recognized as discrete items in the quarter in which they occur.  The Company recorded no income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company has a valuation allowance that fully offsets net deferred tax assets. 

NOTE 7   COMMON STOCK 

On April 16, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by increasing the Company's authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million and increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share held.   

On January 20, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the  Nevada SOS ) whereby decreasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. The Company s Board of Directors approved this amendment on January 13, 2016 and shareholders holding 68.65% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on January 14, 2016.

GENERAL 

As described below Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State in January 2016 whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of its issued and outstanding  shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held.  The share amounts herein are adjusted to reflect such decrease. 

America Resources Exploration Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on January 24, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, with the specific intended business activity of operating photo booth rentals. The Company was incorporated under the name  Alazzio Entertainment Corp.  and changed its name to America Resources Exploration Inc. on April 29, 2015. 

On April 3, 2015, a change in control of Alazzio Entertainment Corp. (the "Company") occurred by virtue of the Company's largest shareholder, Dmitri Kapsumun selling 900,000 shares (split adjusted) of the Company's common stock to Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation. Such shares represent 71.77% of the Company's total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, Rise Fast Limited arranged with the resigning member of the Company's Board of Directors, to appoint Mr. Huang Yu as the sole officer and director of the Company.  

On April 16, 2015,  the Company filed  a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada  Secretary of State (the "Nevada SOS") whereby it amended its Articles of  Incorporation  by  increasing  the Company's authorized  number of shares of common  stock from 75 million to 300 million (not adjusted for the one (1) for one hundred (100) stock split) and increasing all of its issued and outstanding  shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share  held.  The Company's Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 15, 2015 and shareholders holding 71.77% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on April 16, 2015. 

On April 17,  2015,  the  Company  filed  Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered  into a statutory  merger with its  wholly-owned  subsidiary, America  Resources  Exploration Inc. pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company was the surviving entity and changed its name to "America Resources Exploration Inc." 

On June 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) with Zheng Xiangwu, a resident of Guang Dong Province, China, whereby the Company issued 40,000 million shares of its common stock in exchange for rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas, consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the  Leases ). 

On June 12, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 40,000 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to Mr. Zheng Xiangwu, who owns the Company s largest shareholder, Rise Fast Limited. The number of shares issued to Mr. Zheng was determined by valuing the Leases at $160,000 and valuing the Company s stock at $0.04 per share. 

4 

Mr. Zheng is the owner of Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation ( Rise Fast ), which is the majority shareholder of the Company. Rise Fast owns 900,000 shares of the Company s common stock. As a result of the transaction consummated pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Mr. Zheng controlled a total of 940,000 shares, which represented 72.64% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares at that time. 

In addition to a change in control of its management and shareholders and entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company's operations prior to entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement were limited to attempting to implement its business plan, issuing shares and filing a registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934. 

In connection with the completion of the acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company has elected to enter into the oil and gas industry. Our primary objective is to enter the oil and gas industry by acquiring active oil and gas fields. This first step will allow us to enter the market in the U.S. and create immediate cash flow from producing wells. The Company intends to take advantage of currently depressed energy prices by taking over fields from companies that are unable to service their excessive debt due to falling oil prices. 

On June 11, 2015 the Company entered into various assignment agreements with Mr. Zheng for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding royalty interests ( ORR s ) as set out in the table below.  From July 6, 2015 through July 9, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of such oil and gas leases and ORR s, whereby the Company issued a total of 6,500 shares of its common stock to Mr. Zheng. The Company valued the transaction at the market price of the shares as at the date of issue, or $0.15 per share for a total value of $97,500.  The Company capitalized the historical cost of the acquired assets totaling $51,263 and recorded a loss on acquisition of $46,237. 

On August 13, 2015 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Inceptus Resources, LLC whereunder the Company acquired a 78% net revenue interest in 200 acres located in Callahan County, Texas, and a 78% net revenue interest in 522 acres also located in Callahan County, Texas.  In respect of the acquired leases the Company issued a total of 5,000 shares of common stock on the closing date, August 19, 2015, which shares were valued at market price on the date of the transaction, totaling $448,500, which amount was capitalized.  As at September 30, 2015 the Company evaluated the capitalized value of the leases and determined to impair the amount in full due to the fact that the Company had no historical cost basis for the leases, and no immediate development plans for the lease land.  A total of $448,500 has been expensed as Impairment loss on oil and gas lease in the third quarter. 

In order to assist the Company s entry into the oil and gas industry, the Company added Joe M. Seabourn and Robert Wiener to its Board of Directors in June 2015.  Mr. Weiner resigned from the Board of Directors in November 2015 and Mr. Seabourn resigned from the Board of Directors in December 2015.  The resignations of Messrs. Weiner and Seabourn were not due to any disagreements of any nature with the Company. 

On January 20, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the "Nevada SOS") whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of its issued and outstanding  shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held.  The Company's Board of Directors approved this amendment on January 13, 2016 and shareholders holding 68.65% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares approved the amendment via a written consent executed on January 14, 2016. 

On January 20, 2016, the Company  filed  Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered  into a statutory  merger with its  wholly-owned  subsidiary, PetroGas Company pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company was the surviving entity and changed its name from America Resources Exploration Inc. to "PetroGas Company". 

Both the reverse stock split and name change described above were effected in the market by FINRA effective March 7, 2016, which also resulted in changing the Company s ticker symbol to  PTCO .

CURRENT INVESTMENTS 

On June 12, 2015, the Company acquired three (3) producing leases covering 714 acres situated in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Texas, located in the Eagle Ford Shale formation - the Jane Burns  C  ( Burns ), the Theo Rogers  C , and the Theo Rogers  A     D  ( Rogers ) Leases. The Company acquired a 99.5% working interest (74.625% net revenue interest) in each lease.   

The Burns and Rogers Leases provide exploration and production opportunities in the Kyote Field pay zone, very near the Eagle Ford Shale play with access to available rig crews and other vendor-servicers, due to their close proximity to San Antonio, Texas. 

The Burns and Rogers Leases hold collectively seven (7) oil wells, but none of which are operating wells. Although Company s management and industry professionals believed at the time that they were acquired that the Company could double or triple previous production on these wells, depressed oil prices indicate that the cost to bring these wells online an uneconomical venture. 

Future Operations 

Management continues to consider plans to reactive the inactive wells through a rework program on the Leases. Additional rights may be leased out from mineral owner to deeper zones near 5,000 feet and below. However, such plans are subject to raising financing of $500,000 to pay for such rework plans and an analysis of potential income based on projected oil prices in the future. 

The Company has also been actively seeking other producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones. 

We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come. 

In the current climate, the Company believes that there are a very large number of oil   gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and that we can strategically position the Company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating shareholder value. 

On the Burns and Rogers Leases, we intend to rework all current wells and bring them back to production once oil prices are in a suitable range. We are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current Leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil. 

For the quarter Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Results of Operations 

For the three month periods ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we had no revenue.  Expenses for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 totaled $22,740 resulting in a net loss of $22,740 as compared to a net loss of $13,943 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the net loss for the three month period ended June 30, 2016, is substantially a result of increased legal fees in the period as a result of certain litigation discussed below, totaling $14,778, interest expenses in the amount of $552, and general and administrative expense of $7,410 as compared to lease operating expense and accretion expense of $2,637 and general and administrative expense of $13,943 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015.  General and administrative expenses decreased over the period as the Company incurred reduced costs related to its reporting obligations in the period. The lease operating expense incurred in 2015 is attributable to the interests in the Leases acquired, and the accretion expense is attributable to the Company s asset retirement obligations for any wells permanently removed from service.  During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 the Company fully expensed the projected asset retirement obligations as none of the Company s wells are currently on production due to economic conditions, and there is no certainly as to when or if the wells will be brought back online.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

As of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we had no cash or cash equivalents, and a negative working capital of $205,970. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets
