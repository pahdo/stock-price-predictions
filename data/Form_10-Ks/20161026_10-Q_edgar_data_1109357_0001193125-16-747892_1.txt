   Index to Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements    
  The notes to the consolidated financial statements that follow are a combined presentation. The following list indicates
the Registrants to which the footnotes apply:       Applicable Notes    
   
       1.    Significant Accounting Policies (All Registrants)    
   Description of Business (All Registrants)       Exelon is a utility services holding company engaged through its principal subsidiaries in the energy generation and energy distribution and transmission businesses. Prior to March 23, 2016,
Exelon s principal, wholly owned subsidiaries included Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. On March 23, 2016, in conjunction with the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the PHI Merger Agreement), Purple Acquisition Corp, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon, merged with and into PHI, with PHI continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon. PHI is a utility services holding company engaged through its principal wholly owned subsidiaries,
Pepco, DPL and ACE, in the energy distribution and transmission businesses. Refer to Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for further information regarding the merger transaction.   
  The energy generation business includes:       

Generation :    Generation, physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its
customer-facing business, Constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation also sells renewable energy and other energy-related products and services. Generation has six reportable segments
consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions.         The energy delivery businesses include:       

ComEd :    Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission
services in northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.          

PECO :    Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission
services in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of
Philadelphia.          

BGE :    Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission
services in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore, and the purchase and      
         56   

Table of Contents  

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore.      

Pepco :    Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission
services in the District of Columbia and major portions of Prince George s County and Montgomery County in Maryland.          

DPL :    Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission
services in portions of Maryland and Delaware, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services in northern Delaware.      

ACE :    Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electric distribution and transmission
services in southern New Jersey.          Basis of Presentation (All Registrants)    
  Pursuant to the acquisition of PHI, Exelon s financial reporting reflects PHI s consolidated financial results
subsequent to the March 23, 2016, acquisition date. Exelon has accounted for the merger transaction applying the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Exelon to be reported in
Exelon s financial statements at fair value, with any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired reported as goodwill. Exelon has pushed-down the application of the acquisition method of accounting to the
consolidated financial statements of PHI such that the assets and liabilities of PHI are similarly recorded at their respective fair values, and goodwill has been established as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements of PHI for periods before and after the March 23, 2016, acquisition date reflect different bases of accounting, and the financial positions and the results of operations of the predecessor and successor periods are not
comparable. The acquisition method of accounting has not been pushed down to PHI s wholly-owned subsidiary utility registrants, Pepco, DPL and ACE.      For financial statement purposes, beginning on March 24, 2016, disclosures that had solely related to PHI, Pepco, DPL or ACE activities now also apply to Exelon, unless otherwise noted. When
appropriate, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures.      Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE have been
reclassified to conform the presentation of these amounts to the current period presentation in Exelon s financial statements. Most significantly for PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE, current regulatory assets and liabilities have been presented
separately from the non-current portions in each respective Consolidated Balance Sheet where recovery or refund is expected within the next 12 months. Additionally, for PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE, the removal cost within Accumulated depreciation
was reclassified to the Regulatory liability or Regulatory asset account to align with Exelon s presentation. The reclassifications were not considered errors for PHI, Pepco, DPL or ACE.   
  In its December 31, 2015 Form 10-K, Exelon revised the presentation on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income for PECO and BGE to reflect separately operating revenues from the sale of electricity and operating revenues from the sale of natural gas, as well as to reflect separately purchased power expense and purchased fuel
expense within the operating expenses section of the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Further, Exelon revised the presentation from Total operating revenues to  Rate-regulated utility revenues  and
 Competitive businesses revenues  on the face of Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. Similarly, Exelon has separately

presented Rate-regulated utility purchased power and fuel expense and Competitive businesses purchased power and fuel expense on the face of Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. The reclassifications described herein were made for presentation purposes and did not affect any of the Registrants  total operating revenues or net income.   
    ACE Basic Generation Service Recovery Mechanism     
  ACE has a recovery mechanism for purchased power costs associated with BGS. ACE records a deferred energy supply
costs regulatory asset or regulatory liability for under or over-recovered costs that are expected to be recovered from or refunded to ACE customers, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, ACE changed its method of accounting for determining
under or over-recovered costs in this recovery mechanism to include unbilled revenues in the determination of under or over-recovered costs. ACE believes this change is preferable as it better reflects the economic impacts of dollar-for-dollar cost
recovery mechanisms. ACE applied the change retrospectively. The impact of the change was a $12 million reduction to ACE s opening Retained earnings as of January 1, 2014 with a corresponding reduction to Regulatory assets. The impact of the
change on Net income attributable to common shareholder was an increase of $8 million and $9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.        Classification of Interest on Uncertain Tax Positions     
  In the first quarter of 2016, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE changed their accounting principle for classification of interest on
uncertain tax positions. PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE have reclassified interest on uncertain tax positions as interest expense from income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. GAAP does not address the
preferability of one acceptable method of accounting over the other for the classification of interest on uncertain tax positions. However, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE believe this change is preferable for comparability of their financial statements
with the financial statements of the other Registrants in the combined filing, for consistency with FERC classification, and for a more appropriate representation of the effective tax rate as they manage the settlement of uncertain tax positions and
interest expense separately. PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE applied the change retrospectively. The reclassification in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is $1 million for
PHI and less than $1 million for Pepco, DPL and ACE. The reclassification amount is more significant for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Each of the Registrant s Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.   
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the three and nine
months then ended are unaudited but, in the opinion of the management of each Registrant include all adjustments that are considered necessary for a fair statement of the Registrants  respective financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All
adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed. The December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets were obtained from audited financial statements. Financial results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. These Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
SEC for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.   
     2.    New Accounting Pronouncements (All Registrants)    
  Exelon has identified the following new accounting standards that have been recently adopted.

     Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per
Share        In May 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that removes the requirement to categorize
within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Investments measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient will be presented as a
reconciling item between the fair value hierarchy disclosure and the investment line item on the Balance Sheet. The guidance also simplified the disclosure requirements for investments valued using the practical expedient. The guidance is effective
for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Registrants adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2016, and applied the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The adoption of this guidance had no
impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 8   Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for the
disclosure impacts.        Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing
customer would account for the arrangement as a license of internal-use software. A cloud computing arrangement would include a software license if (1) the customer has a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the
hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. If the arrangement does not contain a
software license, it would be accounted for as a service contract. The Registrants prospectively adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets,
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.   
    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis     
  In February 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends the consolidation analysis for variable interest
entities (VIEs) as well as voting interest entities. The new guidance primarily (1) changes the VIE assessment of limited partnerships, (2) amends the effect that fees paid to a decision maker or service provider have on the VIE analysis, (3) amends
how variable interests held by a reporting entity s related parties and de facto agents impact its consolidation conclusion, (4) clarifies how to determine whether equity holders (as a group) have power over an entity, and (5) provides a scope
exception for registered and similar unregistered money market funds. The guidance became effective for the Registrants January 1, 2016. The Registrants adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2016. The Registrants have evaluated the standard
and have not identified any changes to consolidation conclusions as a result of the new guidance, but have identified additional entities that are now considered VIEs. See Note 3   Variable Interest Entities for the disclosure
impacts.     The following issued accounting standards are not yet required to be reflected in the consolidated
financial statements of the Registrants.        Revenue from Contracts with Customers     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the criteria for recognizing revenue from a contract with
a customer. The new standard replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition, including most industry specific guidance, with a five step model for recognizing and measuring revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of the new standard
is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries and across capital markets. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of goods or   
         59   

Table of Contents  

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires a number of disclosures regarding the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flows. The guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of initial adoption (modified retrospective method). The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures as well as the transition method that they will use to adopt the guidance. Exelon is considering the impacts of the new guidance on its ability
to recognize revenue for certain contracts where collectability is in question, its accounting for contributions in aid of construction, bundled sales contracts and contracts with pricing provisions that may require it to recognize revenue at prices
other than the contract price (e.g., straight line or estimated future market prices). In addition, the Registrants will be required to capitalize costs to acquire new contracts, whereas Exelon currently expenses those costs as incurred. The
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with the option to early adopt the standard for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Registrants do not plan to early adopt the
standard. In March 2016, the FASB issued a final amendment to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations and in April 2016 issued a final amendment to clarify the guidance related to identifying performance
obligations and the accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Registrants do not expect significant impacts based on these updates. In May 2016, the FASB issued a final amendment regarding narrow scope improvements and practical
expedients. The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of this update.        Leases     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance requires lessees to recognize both the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet for
most leases, whereas today only financing type lease liabilities (capital leases) are recognized in the balance sheet. This is expected to require significant changes to systems, processes and procedures in order to recognize and measure leases
recorded on the balance sheet that are currently classified as operating leases. In addition, the definition of a lease has been revised in regards to when an arrangement conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset under the
arrangement which may result in changes to the classification of an arrangement as a lease. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from current GAAP.
The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under current GAAP. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize
and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures as well as the potential to early adopt the guidance.        Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory     
  In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which instructs entities to recognize the income tax consequences
of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs (compared to current GAAP which prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to
an outside party). The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly
to retained earnings as of the beginning of the   
         60

period of adoption. The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures as well as the potential to early adopt the guidance.   
    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of
certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance addresses cash flows related to the following: debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after
a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial
interest in securitization transactions, and the application of the predominance principle to separately identifiable cash flows. The standard is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The guidance must be applied on a
retrospective basis. The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.        Impairment of Financial Instruments        In June 2016,
the FASB issued authoritative guidance that adds an impairment model to U.S. GAAP called the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model for financial instruments within the scope of the guidance, which includes loans, trade receivables, debt
securities classified as held-to-maturity and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the new guidance, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity would be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the
entity s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. An entity must consider all available relevant information when estimating expected credit losses. Historical charge-off rates may be
used as a starting point for determining expected credit losses; however, the entity must also evaluate how conditions that existed during the historical charge-off period may differ from its current expectations and accordingly revise its estimate
of expected credit losses. The standard does not make changes to the existing impairment models for non-financial assets such as fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill. The standard will be effective January 1, 2020. The Registrants are currently
assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.   
    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify various aspects to how share-based payment
awards to employees are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The new guidance eliminates additional paid-in capital pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted if all provisions are adopted within the same period. The guidance is required to be applied on either a prospective,
modified retrospective, or retrospective basis depending on the provisions applied. The Registrants do not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. The Registrants are currently assessing the potential to early adopt the guidance.        Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting        In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance eliminating the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level ownership or degree of
influence of an   
         61   

Table of Contents  

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

existing investment. The guidance now requires an investor to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held
interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The
Registrants do not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. The Registrants
are currently assessing the potential to early adopt the guidance.        Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing
Hedge Accounting Relationships        In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which clarifies
that a change in the counterparty of a derivative contract does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedge accounting relationship as long as all of the other hedge accounting criteria are met. The standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Entities have the option to adopt this standard on a prospective basis to new derivative contract novations or on a modified retrospective basis. The Registrants do not expect
that this guidance will have a significant impact on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. The Registrants are currently assessing
the transition method and the potential to early adopt the guidance.        Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt
Instruments        In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which simplifies the embedded
derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options by removing the requirement to assess whether a contingent event is related to interest rates or credit risks. The guidance clarifies that a contingent put or call
option embedded in a debt instrument would be evaluated for possible separate accounting as a derivative instrument without regard to the nature of the exercise contingency. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all existing and future debt instruments. The Registrants do not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact
on Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures and are currently assessing the potential to early adopt the guidance.   
    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which (i) requires all investments in equity securities, including
other ownership interests such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies, to be carried at fair value through net income, (ii) requires an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the
presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, (iii) amends several disclosure requirements, including the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value or a
description of the changes in the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value, and (iv) requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost at the amount that would be received to sell the
asset or paid to transfer the liability. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to
retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of adoption (modified retrospective method). The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures as well as the potential to early adopt the guidance.

     Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. The new guidance defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This definition is consistent with
existing authoritative guidance. Current guidance requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The
guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied prospectively. The Registrants do not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact on their
Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. The Registrants are currently assessing the potential to early adopt the guidance.   
     3.    Variable Interest Entities (All Registrants)    
  A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk to
finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or equity owners who do not have the obligation to
absorb expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. Companies are required to consolidate a VIE if they are its primary beneficiary, which is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities that
most significantly affect the entity s economic performance.      At September 30, 2016, Exelon,
Generation, BGE, PHI and ACE collectively consolidated nine VIEs or VIE groups for which the applicable Registrant was the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2015, Exelon, Generation and BGE collectively had seven consolidated VIEs or VIE
groups and PHI and ACE collectively had one consolidated VIE ( see Consolidated Variable Interest Entities below) . As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Exelon and Generation collectively had significant interests in
nine and eight other VIEs, respectively, for which the applicable Registrant does not have the power to direct the entities  activities and, accordingly, was not the primary beneficiary  (see Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities
below) .        Consolidated Variable Interest Entities     
  In June 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an arrangement to
purchase a 90% equity interest and 99% of the tax attributes of another distributed energy company. In November 2015, Generation sold 69% of its equity interest in 2015 ESA Investco, LLC to a tax equity investor. Generation and the tax equity
investor will contribute up to a total of $250 million of equity incrementally from inception through December 2016 in proportion to their ownership interests, which equates up to approximately $172 million for the tax equity investor and up to $78
million for Generation (see Note 18   Commitments and Contingencies for more details). The investment in the distributed energy company was evaluated, and it was determined to be a VIE for which Generation is not the primary
beneficiary (see additional details in the Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities section below). As of December 31, 2015, Generation consolidated 2015 ESA Investco, LLC under the voting interest model. However, pursuant to the new consolidation
guidance effective as of January 1, 2016 for the Registrants, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC meets the definition of a VIE because the company has a similar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have kick out rights with respect
to the general partner. (For additional details related to the new consolidation guidance, see Note 2   New Accounting Pronouncements.) Under VIE guidance, Generation is the primary beneficiary; therefore, the entity
continues to be consolidated.      Exelon s, Generation s, BGE s, PHI s and ACE s
consolidated VIEs consist of:       

A retail gas group formed by Generation to enter into a collateralized gas supply agreement with a third-party gas supplier,
     
         63

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

a group of solar project limited liability companies formed by Generation to build, own and operate solar power facilities,

several wind project companies designed by Generation to develop, construct and operate wind generation facilities,      

a group of companies formed by Generation to build, own and operate other generating facilities,      

certain retail power and gas companies for which Generation is the sole supplier of energy,      

CENG,          

BondCo, a special purpose bankruptcy remote limited liability company formed by BGE to acquire, hold, issue and service bonds secured by rate
stabilization property, and          

ATF, a special purpose entity formed by ACE for the purpose of securitizing authorized portions of ACE s recoverable stranded costs through the
issuance and sale of transition bonds.         As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, ComEd, PECO, Pepco and DPL did not have any material consolidated VIEs.      As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI and ACE provided the following support to their respective consolidated VIEs:       

Generation provides operating and capital funding to the solar and wind entities for ongoing construction, operations and maintenance of the solar
and wind power facilities and there is limited recourse to Generation related to certain solar and wind entities.          

Generation and Exelon, where indicated, provide the following support to CENG (see Note 5  Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear
Group, LLC and Note 26   Related Party Transactions of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding Generation s and Exelon s transactions with CENG):      

under the NOSA, Generation conducts all activities related to the operation of the CENG nuclear generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries (the
CENG fleet) and provides corporate and administrative services for the remaining life and decommissioning of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to the CENG member rights of EDF,

under the Power Services Agency Agreement (PSAA), Generation provides scheduling, asset management, and billing services to the CENG fleet for the
remaining operating life of the CENG nuclear plants,          

under power purchase agreements with CENG, Generation purchased or will purchase 50.01% of the available output generated by the CENG nuclear plants
not subject to other contractual agreements from January 2015 through the end of the operating life of each respective plant. However, pursuant to amendments dated March 31, 2015, the energy obligations under the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (Ginna)
PPAs have been suspended during the term of the Reliability Support Services Agreement (RSSA) (see Note 5   Regulatory Matters for additional details),      

Generation provided a $400 million loan to CENG. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining obligation is $312 million, including accrued
interest, which reflects the principal payment made in January 2015,      
         64

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF against third-party claims that may arise from any
future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this Indemnity Agreement. (See Note 18  Commitments
and Contingencies for more details),          

in connection with CENG s severance obligations, Generation has agreed to reimburse CENG for a total of approximately $6 million of the
severance benefits paid or to be paid in 2014 through 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there was no remaining obligation,          

Generation and EDF share in the $637 million of contingent payment obligations for the payment of contingent retrospective premium adjustments for
the nuclear liability insurance,          

Generation provides a guarantee of approximately $8 million associated with hazardous waste management facilities and underground storage tanks. In
addition, EDF executed a reimbursement agreement that provides reimbursement to Exelon for 49.99% of any amounts paid by Generation under this guarantee,      

Generation and EDF are the members-insured with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited and have assigned the loss benefits under the insurance and the
NEIL premium costs to CENG and guarantee the obligations of CENG under these insurance programs in proportion to their respective member interests (see Note 18   Commitments and Contingencies for more details), and

Exelon has executed an agreement to provide up to $245 million to support the operations of CENG as well as a $165 million guarantee of CENG s
cash pooling agreement with its subsidiaries.          

Generation provides approximately $16 million in credit support for the retail power and gas companies for which Generation is the sole supplier of
energy.          

Generation provides a $75 million parental guarantee to a third-party gas supplier and provides limited recourse to other third-party gas suppliers
and customers in support of its retail gas group.          

Generation provides operating and capital funding to the other generating facilities for ongoing construction, operations and maintenance and
provides a parental guarantee of up to $275 million in support of the payment obligations related to the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract in support of one of its other generating facilities.      

In the case of BondCo, BGE is required to remit all payments it receives from all residential customers through non-bypassable, rate stabilization
charges to BondCo. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, BGE remitted $27 million and $64 million to BondCo, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, BGE remitted $21 million and $63
million to BondCo, respectively.          

In the case of ATF, proceeds from the sale of each series of transition bonds by ATF were transferred to ACE in exchange for the transfer by ACE to
ATF of the right to collect a non-bypassable Transition Bond Charge from ACE customers pursuant to bondable stranded costs rate orders issued by the NJBPU in an amount sufficient to fund the principal and interest payments on transition bonds and
related taxes, expenses and fees. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, ACE transferred $20 million and $47 million to ATF, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, ACE transferred $18 million and
$45 million to ATF, respectively.         For each of the consolidated VIEs, except as otherwise
noted:       

the assets of the VIEs are restricted and can only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIE;

Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI and ACE did not provide any additional material financial support to the VIEs;      

Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI and ACE did not have any material contractual commitments or obligations to provide financial support to the VIEs; and

the creditors of the VIEs did not have recourse to Exelon s, Generation s, BGE s, PHI s or ACE s general credit.
        The carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIEs  assets and
liabilities included in the Registrants  consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

    Includes the CNEG retail gas pension obligation, which is presented as a net asset balance within the Prepaid pension asset line item on
Generation s balance sheet. See Note 13   Retirement Benefits for additional details.           Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities     
  Exelon s and Generation s variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs generally include equity investments and
energy purchase and sale contracts. For the equity investments, the carrying amount of the investments is reflected on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments. For the energy purchase and sale contracts
(commercial agreements), the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to their involvement with the VIEs are predominately related to working capital accounts and
generally represent the amounts owed by, or owed to, Exelon and Generation for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycles under the commercial agreements. Further, Exelon and Generation have not provided material debt or equity
support, liquidity arrangements or performance guarantees associated with these commercial agreements.      The
Registrants  unconsolidated VIEs consist of:       

Energy purchase and sale agreements with VIEs for which Generation has concluded that consolidation is not required.      

Asset sale agreement with ZionSolutions, LLC and EnergySolutions, Inc. in which Generation has a variable interest but has concluded that
consolidation is not required.          

Equity investments in energy development companies, distributed energy companies, and energy generating facilities for which Generation has
concluded that consolidation is not required.         As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, Exelon and Generation had significant unconsolidated variable interests in nine and eight VIEs, respectively for which Exelon or Generation, as applicable, was not the primary beneficiary; including certain equity investments
and certain commercial agreements. Exelon and Generation only include unconsolidated VIEs that are individually material in the tables below. However, Generation has several individually immaterial VIEs that in aggregate represent a total investment
of $20 million. These immaterial VIEs are equity and debt securities in energy development companies. The maximum exposure to loss related to these securities is limited to the $20 million included in Investments on Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The risk of a loss was assessed to be remote and, accordingly, Exelon and Generation have not recognized a liability associated with any portion of the maximum exposure to loss.   
  In July 2014, Generation entered into an arrangement to purchase a 90% equity interest and 90% of the tax attributes of a
distributed energy company. Generation s total equity commitment in this arrangement was $91 million and was paid incrementally over an approximate two year period (see Note 18   Commitments and Contingencies for additional
details). This arrangement did not meet the definition of a VIE and was recorded as an equity method investment. However, pursuant to the new consolidation guidance effective as of January 1, 2016 for the Registrants, the distributed energy company
meets the definition of a VIE because the company has a similar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have kick out rights of the general partner. (For additional details related to the new consolidation guidance,
see Note 2   New Accounting Pronouncements.) Generation is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, the investment continues to be recorded using the equity method.   
  In June 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an arrangement to
purchase a 90% equity interest and 99% of the tax attributes of a distributed energy company,

which is an unconsolidated VIE. Separate from the equity investment, Generation provided $27 million in cash to the other (10%) equity holder in the distributed energy company in exchange
for a convertible promissory note. In November 2015, Generation sold 69% of its equity interest in 2015 ESA Investco, LLC to a tax equity investor. Generation and the tax equity investor will contribute up to a total of $250 million of equity
incrementally from inception through December 2016 in proportion of their ownership interests, which equates up to approximately $172 million for the tax equity investor and up to $78 million for Generation (see Note 18   Commitments
and Contingencies for additional details). Generation and the tax equity investor provide a parental guarantee of up to $275 million in proportion to their ownership interests in support of 2015 ESA Investco, LLC s obligation to make
equity contributions to the distributed energy company, which is an unconsolidated VIE. The investment in the distributed energy company was evaluated and it was determined to be a VIE for which Generation is not the primary beneficiary. See
additional details in the Consolidated Variable Interest Entities section above.      The following tables present
summary information about Exelon and Generation s significant unconsolidated VIE entities:       

(a)  
    These items represent amounts on the unconsolidated VIE balance sheets, not on Exelon s or Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
items are included to provide information regarding the relative size of the unconsolidated VIEs.      

(b)  
    These items represent amounts on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the asset sale agreement with
ZionSolutions, LLC. The net assets pledged for Zion Station decommissioning includes gross pledged assets of $135 million and $206 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively; offset by payables to ZionSolutions
LLC of $124 million and $189 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These items are included to provide information regarding the relative size of the ZionSolutions LLC unconsolidated VIE.

   For each of the unconsolidated VIEs, Exelon and Generation has assessed
the risk of a loss equal to their maximum exposure to be remote and, accordingly, Exelon and Generation have not recognized a liability associated with any portion of the maximum exposure to loss. In addition, there are no material agreements with,
or commitments by, third parties that would affect the fair value or risk of their variable interests in these VIEs.        
 4.    Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions (Exelon, Generation, PHI and Pepco)        Merger with
Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Exelon)         Description of Transaction     
  On March 23, 2016, Exelon completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Purple Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub) and Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI). As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into PHI (the PHI Merger) with PHI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon and Exelon Energy
Delivery Company, LLC (EEDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon which also owns Exelon s interests in ComEd, PECO and BGE (through a special purpose subsidiary in the case of BGE). Following the completion of the PHI Merger, Exelon and
PHI completed a series of internal corporate organization restructuring transactions resulting in the transfer of PHI s unregulated business interests to Exelon and Generation and the transfer of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE to a special purpose
subsidiary of EEDC.        Regulatory Matters     
  Approval of the merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI
agreeing to certain commitments including where applicable: customer rate credits, funding for energy efficiency and delivery system modernization programs, a green sustainability fund, workforce development initiatives, charitable contributions,
renewable generation and other required commitments. In addition, the orders approving the merger in Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland include a  most favored nation  provision which, generally speaking, requires allocation of merger
benefits proportionally across all the jurisdictions. In the first quarter of 2016, Exelon estimated and recorded total nominal cost commitments of $508 million, excluding renewable generation commitments (approximately $444 million on a net present
value basis, excluding renewable generation commitments and charitable contributions).     During the third and
fourth quarters of 2016, Exelon and PHI filed proposals in Delaware and New Jersey and continued negotiations in Maryland for amounts and allocations reflecting the application of the most favored nation provision, resulting in total nominal cost of
commitments of $513 million, excluding renewable generation commitments (with no change in the $444 million net present value basis amount, excluding renewable generation commitments and charitable contributions). A similar filing will be required
in Maryland. These filings, which reflect agreements reached with certain parties to the merger proceedings in the jurisdictions, are subject to regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction. The Delaware Commission approved the amounts
and allocations in September and October 2016 and an order from the New Jersey BPU is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. No changes in commitment cost levels are required in the District of Columbia.   
  The proposed settlements included certain changes in the amount and mix of previously reported, expected commitment
types, resulting in adjustments to the estimated commitment costs recorded by Exelon Corporate and by the individual PHI utility reporting entities such that more commitments are expected to be obligations of Exelon Corporate for energy efficiency,
workforce development and other programs as opposed to obligations of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE for additional customer rate credits. Specifically, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, Exelon Corporate recorded an increase of $55 million and
PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE recorded decreases of $50 million, $13 million, $27 million and $10 million, respectively, in Operating and maintenance expense.

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    
   
   The following amounts were recognized as total commitment costs in
Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s, PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and PHI s successor period:

(a)  
    Included within the individual line items is the most favored nation provision estimate of $6 million, $5 million $38 million, $49 million, and $134
million at Pepco, DPL, ACE, PHI and Exelon, respectively.         Pursuant to the orders approving
the merger, Exelon made $73 million, $46 million and $49 million of equity contributions to Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016 to fund the after-tax amounts of the customer bill credit and the customer base rate credit
commitments.      In addition, Exelon is committed to develop or to assist in the commercial development of
approximately 37 MWs of new generation in Maryland, District of Columbia, and Delaware, 27 MWs of which are expected to be completed by 2018. These investments are expected to total approximately $137 million, are expected to be primarily capital in
nature, and will generate future earnings at Exelon and Generation. The actual cost of investment in new generation may differ depending on the result of final negotiations and application of the most favored nation provision. Investment costs will
be recognized as incurred and recorded on Exelon s and Generation s financial statements. Exelon has also committed to purchase 100 MWs of wind energy in PJM, to procure 120 MWs of wind RECs for the purpose of meeting Delaware s
renewable portfolio standards, and to maintain and promote energy efficiency and demand response programs in the PHI jurisdictions.      Pursuant to the various jurisdictions  merger approval conditions, over specified periods Pepco, DPL and ACE are not permitted to reduce employment levels due to involuntary attrition associated with
the merger integration process and have made other commitments regarding hiring and relocation of positions.   
  Exelon was previously named in suits filed in the Delaware Chancery Court alleging that individual directors of PHI
breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the merger transaction, and that Exelon aided and abetted the individual directors  breaches. The suits sought rescission of the merger and unspecified damages and costs. On June 1, 2016, the
parties executed a settlement to resolve all claims, subject to the approval of the Delaware Court. A hearing had been scheduled for September 8, 2016 in the Delaware Court to consider whether to approve the settlement. However, on August 19,
2016, the plaintiffs advised Exelon that they had determined to dismiss the case in its entirety and with prejudice. On August 24, 2016, the Delaware Court issued an order approving the dismissal.   
  In July 2015, the OPC, Public Citizen, Inc., the Sierra Club and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) filed
motions to stay the MDPSC order approving the merger and in July and August, Exelon, PHI, the MDPSC, Prince George s County and Montgomery County filed responses opposing the motions to stay. The judge issued an order denying the motions for
stay on August 12, 2015. On January 8, 2016, the Circuit Court   
         71

judge affirmed the MDPSC s order approving the merger and denied the petitions for judicial review filed by the OPC, the Sierra Club, CCAN and Public Citizen, Inc. On January 19, 2016,
the OPC filed a notice of appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, and on January 21, the Sierra Club and CCAN filed a notice of appeal. Exelon believes the matters are without merit. These appeals are not expected to be resolved any earlier
than the first quarter of 2017.      Between March 25, 2016 and April 22, 2016, various parties filed motions with
the DCPSC to reconsider its March 23, 2016 order approving the merger. On June 17, 2016, the DCPSC denied all motions. In August 2016, the District of Columbia Office of People s Counsel, the District of Columbia Government, and
Public Citizen jointly with DC Sun each filed petitions for judicial review of the DCPSC s March 23, 2016 order with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. On September 9, 2016, the Court consolidated the appeals. Although the Court
has not yet issued a scheduling order, a decision on this matter is not expected until the second or third quarter of 2017. Exelon believes the matters are without merit.        Accounting for the Merger Transaction        The total
purchase price consideration of approximately $7.1 billion for the PHI Merger consisted of cash paid to PHI shareholders, cash paid for PHI preferred securities and cash paid for PHI stock-based compensation equity awards as follows:   

(a)  
    As of December 31, 2015, the preferred stock was included in Other non-current assets on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(b)  
    PHI s unvested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units issued prior to April 29, 2014 were immediately
vested and paid in cash upon the close of the merger. PHI s remaining unvested time-based restricted stock units as of the close of the merger were cancelled. There were no remaining unvested performance-based restricted stock units
as of the close of the merger.         PHI shareholders received $27.25 of cash in exchange for
each share of PHI common stock outstanding as of the effective date of the merger. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Exelon entered into a Subscription Agreement under which it purchased $180 million of a new class of nonvoting,
nonconvertible and nontransferable preferred securities of PHI prior to December 31, 2015. On March 23, 2016, the preferred securities were cancelled for no consideration to Exelon, and accordingly, the $180 million cash consideration
previously paid to acquire the preferred securities was treated as purchase price consideration.     The
valuations performed in the first quarter of 2016 to assess the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed were considered preliminary as a result of the short time period between the closing of the merger and the end of the first
quarter of 2016. Accounting guidance provides that the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from the date of the merger as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed;
however, Exelon expects to finalize these amounts by the end of 2016. During the second and third quarters, certain modifications were made to preliminary valuation amounts for acquired property, plant and equipment, unamortized energy
contracts, current liabilities, long-term debt,   
         72

deferred income taxes and pension and OPEB liability resulting in a $16 million net decrease to goodwill. The preliminary amounts recognized are subject to further revision to the extent that
additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Any changes to the fair value assessments may affect the purchase price allocation and could potentially impact goodwill.   
  Exelon applied push-down accounting to PHI, and accordingly, the PHI assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
recorded at their estimated fair values on Exelon s and PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 23, 2016, as follows:       
    On its successor financial statements, PHI has recorded, beginning March 24, 2016,
Membership interest equity of $7.2 billion, which is greater than the total $7.1 billion purchase price, reflecting the impact of a $59 million deferred tax liability recorded only at Exelon Corporate to reflect unitary state income tax consequences
of the merger.      The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed totaled $4.0 billion, which was recognized as goodwill by PHI and Exelon at the acquisition date, reflecting the value associated with enhancing Exelon s regulated utility portfolio of businesses, including the ability to
leverage experience and best practices across the utilities and the opportunities for synergies. For purposes of future required impairment assessments, the goodwill has been preliminarily assigned to PHI s reportable units Pepco, DPL and ACE
in the amounts of $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. None of this goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.      Immediately following closing of the merger, $235 million of net assets included in the table above associated with PHI s unregulated business interests were distributed by PHI to Exelon. Exelon
contributed $163 million of such net assets to Generation.      The fair values of PHI s assets and
liabilities were determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows, future market
prices and impacts of utility rate regulation. There were also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired.

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    
   
   Exelon s and PHI s carrying amount of goodwill for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:       

(a)  
    As of September 30, 2016, there were no changes to the carrying amount of goodwill for ComEd, see Note 11  Intangible Assets of the
Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further information.         Through its wholly-owned rate regulated
utility subsidiaries, most of PHI s assets and liabilities are subject to cost-of-service rate regulation. Under such regulation, rates charged to customers are established by a regulator to provide for recovery of costs and a fair return
on invested capital, or rate base, generally measured at historical cost. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, for regulated assets and liabilities included in rate base or otherwise earning a return (primarily property, plant and
equipment and regulatory assets earning a return), no fair value adjustments were recorded as historical cost is viewed as a reasonable proxy for fair value.      Fair value adjustments were applied to the historical cost bases of other assets and liabilities subject to rate regulation but not earning a return (including debt instruments and pension and OPEB
obligations). In these instances, a corresponding offsetting regulatory asset or liability was also established, as the underlying utility asset and liability amounts are recoverable from or refundable to customers at historical cost (and not
at fair value) through the rate setting process. Similar treatment was applied for fair value adjustments to record intangible assets and liabilities, such as for electricity and gas energy supply contracts as further described
below. Regulatory assets and liabilities established to offset fair value adjustments are amortized in amounts and over time frames consistent with the realization or settlement of the fair value adjustments, with no impact on reported net
income. See Note 5   Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the fair value of regulatory assets and liabilities established by Exelon and PHI.   
  Fair value adjustments were recorded at Exelon and PHI for the difference between the contract price and the market price
of electricity and gas energy supply contracts of PHI s wholly-owned rate regulated utility subsidiaries. These adjustments are intangible assets and liabilities classified as unamortized energy contracts on Exelon s and PHI s
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016. The difference between the contract price and the market price at the acquisition date of the Merger was recognized for each contract as either an intangible asset or liability. In
total, Exelon and PHI recorded a net $1.5 billion liability reflecting out-of-the-money contracts. The valuation of the acquired intangible assets and liabilities was estimated by applying either the market approach or the income approach depending
on the nature of the underlying contract. The market approach was utilized when prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable transactions were available. Otherwise the income approach, which is based
upon discounted projected future cash flows associated with the underlying contracts, was utilized. In certain instances, the valuations were based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable
accounting guidance. Key estimates and inputs include forecasted power prices and the discount rate. The unamortized energy contract fair value adjustment amounts and the corresponding offsetting regulatory asset and liability amounts are amortized
through Purchase power and fuel expense or Operating revenues, as applicable, over the life of the applicable contract in relation to the present value of the underlying cash flows as of the merger date.

   As mentioned, under cost-of-service rate regulation, rates charged to
customers are established by a regulator to provide for recovery of costs and a fair return on invested capital, or rate base, generally measured at historical cost. Historical cost information therefore is the most relevant presentation for
the financial statements of PHI s rate regulated utility subsidiary registrants, Pepco, DPL and ACE. As such, Exelon and PHI did not push-down the application of acquisition accounting to PHI s utility registrants, and therefore the
financial statements of Pepco, DPL and ACE do not reflect the revaluation of any assets and liabilities.      The
current impact of PHI, including its unregulated businesses, on Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income includes Operating revenues of $1.4 billion and Net income of $169 million during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, and Operating revenues of $2.7 billion and Net loss of $(92) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Registrants have recognized costs to achieve the PHI acquisition as follows:   

(a)  
    The costs incurred are classified primarily within Operating and maintenance expense in the Registrants  respective Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income, with the exception of the financing costs, which are included within Interest expense. Costs do not include merger commitments discussed above.      

(b)  
    Reflects costs (benefits) recorded at Exelon related to financing, including mark-to-market activity on forward-starting interest rate swaps.

(c)  
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes the reversal of previously incurred acquisition, integration and financing costs of $8
million, $6 million, $10 million, $3 million and $13 million incurred at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and PHI, respectively, that have been deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset for anticipated recovery. See Note 5  Regulatory
Matters for more information.           Pro-forma Impact of the Merger     
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Exelon as if
the merger with PHI had taken place on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma information was calculated after applying Exelon s accounting policies and adjusting PHI s results to reflect purchase accounting adjustments.

  On September 1, 2016, Generation acquired the competitive retail electricity and natural gas business of Consolidated
Edison Solutions, Inc. (ConEdison Solutions), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. for a purchase price of $257 million including net working capital of $204 million. The renewable energy, sustainable services and energy efficiency businesses
of ConEdison Solutions are excluded from the transaction. As of September 30, 2016, Generation had remitted $235 million to ConEdison Solutions and the remaining balance of $22 million, which is included in Other current liabilities on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, will be paid during the first quarter of 2017.

   The purchase price equaled the estimated fair value of the net assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed and, therefore, no goodwill or bargain purchase was recorded as of September 30, 2016. The purchase accounting is preliminary, and, although not expected, may be further adjusted from what is shown above.
Accounting guidance provides that the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from the date of the acquisition as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however,
Generation expects to finalize these amounts by the first quarter of 2017.      The fair values of ConEdison
Solutions  assets and liabilities were determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash
flows and future power and fuel market prices.      It is impracticable to determine the post-close impact of
ConEdison Solutions as the operations of ConEdison Solutions have been integrated into Generation s operations and are therefore not distinguishable after the acquisition.       Proposed Acquisition of James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Generating Station (Exelon and Generation)       On August 8, 2016, Generation executed a series of agreements with Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick LLC (Entergy) to acquire the 838MW single-unit James A. FitzPatrick (FitzPatrick) nuclear generating station
located in Scriba, New York for a cash purchase price of $110 million. As part of the transaction, Generation would receive the FitzPatrick NDT fund assets and assume the obligation to decommission FitzPatrick. Closing of the transaction is
currently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017 and is dependent upon regulatory approval by FERC, NRC and the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC). The transaction is also subject to the notification and reporting
requirements of the HSR Act (which has been completed) and other customary closing conditions. The NRC license for FitzPatrick expires in 2034. Entergy had previously announced plans in November 2015 to early retire FitzPatrick at the end of the
current fuel cycle in January 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, Generation will reimburse Entergy for approximately $200 million to $250 million of incremental costs to prepare for and conduct the plant refueling outage as well as to operate
and maintain the plant after the refueling outage, scheduled to end in February 2017, through the closing date. These are costs which otherwise would have been avoided by FitzPatrick s planned permanent shutdown in January 2017. Generation
will be entitled to all revenues from FitzPatrick s electricity and capacity sales for the period commencing upon completion of the refueling outage through the acquisition closing date. The agreements provide for certain termination rights,
including the right of either party to terminate if the transaction has not been consummated within 12 months due to failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals.   
  On October 11, 2016, Public Citizen, Inc. filed a protest with FERC challenging Generation and Entergy s application
to FERC for the transfer of ownership of FitzPatrick. No other party to the proceeding has filed any protests or comments. Generation and Entergy had requested FERC to approve the FitzPatrick transaction by November 18, 2016, however FERC is under
no obligation to do so. The timing of FERC s decision on Generation and Entergy s application and the outcome of this protest are currently uncertain. Refer to Note 5  Regulatory Matters for additional information on the New York
CES and ZEC program.      The transaction is expected to be accounted for as a business combination. For
accounting and financial reporting purposes, the costs for which Generation reimburses Entergy as well as the revenue received from FitzPatrick prior to the closing of the transaction will be treated as part of the purchase price consideration.
Generation will record the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. To the extent the purchase price is greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired, goodwill will be recorded. To the extent the
fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain will be recorded.

   As of September 30, 2016, Generation has paid a non-refundable
deposit of $10 million and reimbursed Entergy for $9 million in costs all of which have been classified with Other noncurrent assets on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts are also reflected within
Acquisition of businesses on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.       Asset Divestitures (Exelon,
Generation, PHI and Pepco)       On April 21, 2016, Generation completed the sale of the retired New Boston
generating site, located in Boston, Massachusetts, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $32 million.   
  On May 2, 2016, Pepco completed the sale of the New York Avenue land parcel, located in Washington, D.C., resulting in a
pre-tax gain of approximately $8 million at Pepco. Due to the fair value adjustments recorded at Exelon and PHI as part of purchase accounting, no gain was recorded in the Exelon and PHI Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income.     On June 16, 2016, Generation initiated the sales process of its Upstream business by executing a
forbearance agreement with the lenders of the nonrecourse debt. See Note 10   Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. As of September 30, 2016, $46 million of Property, plant and equipment and $5 million of Asset
retirement obligation are classified as held for sale within Other current assets and Other current liabilities, respectively, on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In October 2016, Generation entered into an agreement
to sell a portion of the Upstream assets which is expected to close before December 31, 2016.      In July 2016,
DPL completed the sale of a 9 acre land parcel located on South Madison Street in Wilmington, DE, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $4 million. Due to the fair value adjustments recorded at Exelon and PHI as part of purchase
accounting, no gain was recorded in the Exelon and PHI Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

disclosures set forth in Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K and Note 7   Regulatory Matters of the PHI 2015 Form 10-K appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of
regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants. The following is an update to that discussion.       Illinois Regulatory Matters
        Distribution Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd).      On April 13, 2016,
ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate with the ICC pursuant to EIMA. The filing establishes the revenue requirement used to set the rates that will take effect in January 2017 after the ICC s review and approval, which is due by
December 2016. The revenue requirement requested is based on 2015 actual costs plus projected 2016 capital additions as well as an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect in 2015 to the actual costs incurred that year.
ComEd s 2016 filing request includes a total increase to the revenue requirement of $138 million, reflecting an increase of $139 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2017 and a decrease of $1 million related to the annual
reconciliation for 2015. The revenue requirement for 2017 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 6.71% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.64%, reflecting the average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580
basis points. The annual reconciliation for 2015 provided for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 6.69% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.59%, reflecting the average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis
points less a performance metrics penalty of 5 basis points. See table below for ComEd s regulatory assets associated with its distribution formula rate. For additional information on ComEd s distribution formula rate filings see Note

     Grand Prairie Gateway Transmission Line (Exelon and
ComEd).          On December 2, 2013, ComEd filed a request to obtain the ICC s approval to construct a 60-mile overhead 345kV transmission line that traverses Ogle, DeKalb, Kane and DuPage Counties in
Northern Illinois. On October 22, 2014, the ICC issued an Order approving ComEd s request. The City of Elgin and certain other parties each filed an appeal of the ICC Order in the Illinois Appellate Court for the Second District. ComEd then
reached a settlement of the appeal filed by all parties except Elgin. On March 31, 2016, the Illinois Appellate Court issued its opinion affirming the ICC s grant of a certificate to ComEd to construct and operate the line. Elgin did not seek
further review of the Illinois Appellate Court decision. On May 28, 2014, in a separate proceeding, FERC issued an order granting ComEd s request to include 100% of the capital costs recorded to construction work in progress during construction
of the line in ComEd s transmission rate base. If the project is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond ComEd s control, FERC approved the ability for ComEd to recover 100% of its prudent costs incurred after May 21, 2014 and 50% of its
costs incurred prior to May 21, 2014 in ComEd s transmission rate base. The costs incurred for the project prior to May 21, 2014 were immaterial. ComEd has acquired the necessary land rights across the project route through voluntary
transactions. ComEd began construction of the line during 2015 with an expected in-service date of 2017.        FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc (Exelon and ComEd).          During 2013, the ICC approved, and directed ComEd and Ameren (the Utilities) to enter into 20-year
sourcing agreements with FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc (FutureGen), under which FutureGen will retrofit and repower an existing plant in Morgan County, Illinois to a 166 MW near zero emissions coal-fueled generation plant, with an assumed
commercial operation date in 2017. The order also directs ComEd and Ameren to recover these costs from their electric distribution customers through the use of a tariff, regardless of whether they purchase electricity from ComEd or Ameren, or from
competitive electric generation suppliers.      In February 2013, ComEd filed an appeal with the Illinois
Appellate Court questioning the legality of requiring ComEd to procure power for retail customers purchasing electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. On July 22, 2014, the Illinois Appellate Court issued its ruling
re-affirming the ICC s order requiring ComEd to enter into the sourcing agreement with FutureGen and allowing the use of a tariff to recover its costs. ComEd decided not to appeal the Illinois Appellate Court s decision to the Illinois
Supreme Court. However, the competitive electric generation suppliers and several large consumers petitioned for leave to appeal the Illinois Appellate Court s decision. On November 26, 2014, the Illinois Supreme Court granted the
petition. ComEd executed the sourcing agreement with FutureGen in accordance with the ICC s order. In addition, ComEd filed a petition with the ICC seeking approval of the tariff allowing for the recovery of its costs associated with the
FutureGen contract from all of its electric distribution customers, which was approved by the ICC on September 30, 2014.      In February 2015, the DOE suspended funding for the cost development of FutureGen. On January 13, 2016, FutureGen informed the Illinois Supreme Court that it had ceased all development efforts on the
FutureGen project. Accordingly, FutureGen requested that the court dismiss the proceeding as moot. In February 2016, FutureGen terminated its sourcing agreement with ComEd. On May 19, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court dismissed the matter as moot. As
a result, ComEd is under no further obligation under this agreement.       Pennsylvania Regulatory Matters    
    Pennsylvania Procurement Proceedings (Exelon and PECO).      Through PECO s first two
PAPUC approved DSP Programs, PECO procured electric supply for its default electric customers through PAPUC approved competitive procurements. DSP I and DSP II expired on May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2015, respectively.   
  The second DSP Program included a number of retail market enhancements recommended by the PAPUC in its previously issued
Retail Markets Intermediate Work Plan Order. PECO was also directed to submit a plan to

allow its low-income CAP customers to purchase their generation supply from EGSs beginning in April 2014. In May 2013, PECO filed its CAP Shopping Plan with the PAPUC. By an Order entered on
January 24, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s plan, with modifications, to make CAP shopping available beginning April 15, 2014. On March 20, 2014, the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA) and low-income advocacy groups filed an appeal and emergency
request for a stay with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court (Court), claiming that the PAPUC-ordered CAP Shopping plan does not contain sufficient protections for low-income customers. On July 14, 2015, the Court issued opinions on the OCA and
low-income advocacy group appeal. Specifically, the Court remanded the issue to the PAPUC with instructions that it approve a rule revision to the PECO CAP Shopping Plan that would prohibit CAP customers from entering into contracts with an EGS that
would impose early cancellation/termination fees. The PAPUC, as well as the low-income advocates and the Office of Consumer Advocate, appealed the Court s decision. On April 5, 2016, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to accept the
appeals. On May 11, 2016, the PAPUC issued a Secretarial Letter requiring PECO to propose a rule revision to the PECO CAP Shopping Plan consistent with the Court s decision. On July 19, 2016, PECO filed a letter stating its intent to revise its
Plan by September 1, 2016 to incorporate the rule revision. On September 1, 2016, PECO filed its proposed rule revision that is consistent with the Court s opinion with a proposed effective date of April 14, 2017.   
  On December 4, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s third DSP Program. The program has a 24-month term from June 1, 2015
through May 31, 2017, and complies with electric generation procurement guidelines set forth in Act 129. Under the program, PECO procured electric supply through four competitive procurements for fixed price full requirements contracts of two years
or less for the residential classes and small and medium commercial classes and spot market price full requirement contracts for the large commercial and industrial class load. Beginning in June 2016, the medium commercial class (101-500 kW) moved
to spot market pricing. In September 2016, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, resulting from the final of its four scheduled procurements. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts
with Generation are included in purchased power from affiliates on PECO s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.      On March 17, 2016, PECO filed its fourth DSP Program with the PAPUC proposing a 24-month term from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2019, in compliance with electric generation procurement guidelines set
forth in Act 129. On October 4, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge recommended that PECO s previously filed partial settlement be approved without modification. The settlement would extend the program period through May 2021 and
consolidate the Medium Commercial and Large Commercial classes of default service customers into a Consolidated Large Commercial Class proposed by the Company. The issue of PECO s implementation of CAP Shopping was reserved for briefing,
and the Administrative Law Judge determined that issue was not a part of the DSP IV case. A decision by the PAPUC is expected in December 2016.      For further information on the Pennsylvania procurement proceedings, see Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K.   
    Energy Efficiency Programs (Exelon and PECO).          On June 19, 2015, the
PAPUC issued its Phase III EE C implementation order that provides energy consumption reduction requirements for the third phase of Act 129 s EE C program with a five-year term from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021.   
  Pursuant to the Phase III implementation order, PECO filed its five-year EE C Phase III Plan with the PAPUC on
November 30, 2015. The Plan sets forth how PECO will reduce electric consumption by at least 1,962,659 MWh, with a goal of 2,100,875 MWh in its service territory for the period June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021. The PAPUC approved
PECO s EE C Phase III Plan, with requested clarifications, on May 19, 2016.

    2016 Maryland Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon, PHI and
Pepco).          On April 19, 2016, Pepco filed an application with the MDPSC requesting an increase of $127 million to its electric distribution base rates, which was later updated to $103 million, based on
a requested ROE of 10.6%. The application is inclusive of a request seeking recovery of Pepco s regulatory assets associated with its AMI program over a five-year period supported by evidence demonstrating that the benefits of the AMI program
exceed the costs on a present value basis. Any adjustments to rates approved by the MDPSC are expected to take effect in November 2016. In addition to the proposed rate increase, Pepco is proposing to continue its Grid Resiliency Program initially
approved in July 2013 in connection with Pepco s electric distribution rate case filed in November 2012. Under the Grid Resiliency Program, Pepco is authorized to receive recovery of specific investments as the assets are placed in service
through the Grid Resiliency Charge. In connection with the Grid Resiliency Program, Pepco proposes to accelerate improvement to priority feeders and install single-phase reclosing fuse technology by investing $16 million a year for two years for a
total of $32 million. Pepco cannot predict how much of the requested rate increase the MDPSC will approve or if it will approve a continuation of Pepco s Grid Resiliency Program proposal.   
    2016 Maryland Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and DPL).      On July 20,
2016, DPL filed an application with the MDPSC requesting an increase of $66 million to its electric distribution base rates, which was later updated to $57 million, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. The application is inclusive of a request
seeking recovery of DPL s regulatory assets associated with its AMI program over a five-year period supported by evidence demonstrating that the benefits of the AMI program exceed the costs on a present value basis. Any adjustments to rates
approved by the MDPSC are expected to take effect in February 2017. DPL cannot predict how much of the requested increase the MDPSC will approve. In addition to the proposed rate increase, DPL is proposing to continue its Grid Resiliency Program
initially approved in September 2013 in connection with DPL s electric distribution rate case filed in February 2013. Under the Grid Resiliency Program, DPL is authorized to receive recovery of specific investments as the assets are placed in
service through the Grid Resiliency Charge. In connection with the Grid Resiliency Program, DPL proposes to accelerate improvement to priority feeders and install single-phase reclosing fuse technology by investing $4.6 million a year for two years
for a total of $9.2 million. DPL cannot predict whether the MDPSC will approve a continuation of DPL s Grid Resiliency Program proposal.        2015 Maryland Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).      On November 6, 2015, and as amended through the course of the proceeding, BGE filed for
electric and natural gas base rate increases with the MDPSC, ultimately requesting annual increases of $116 million and $78 million respectively, of which $104 million and $37 million, were related to recovery of electric and natural gas smart grid
initiative costs, respectively. BGE also proposed to recover an annual increase of approximately $30 million for Baltimore City underground conduit fees through a surcharge.  
  On June 3, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order in which the MDPSC found compelling evidence to conclude that BGE s smart
grid initiative overall was cost beneficial to customers. However, the June 3 order contained several cost disallowances and adjustments, including not allowing BGE to defer or recover through a surcharge the $30 million increase in annual
Baltimore City underground conduit fees. On June 30, 2016, BGE filed a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order requesting that the MDPSC modify its order to reverse certain decisions including the decision associated with the Baltimore City
underground conduit fees. OPC also subsequently filed for a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order.

   On July 29, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order on the petitions for
rehearing that reversed certain of its prior cost disallowances and adjustments related to the smart grid initiative. Through the combination of the orders, the MDPSC authorized electric and natural gas rate increases of $44 million and $48 million,
respectively, and an allowed ROE for the electric and natural gas distribution businesses of 9.75% and 9.65%, respectively. The new electric and natural gas base rates took effect for service rendered on or after June 4, 2016. However,
MDPSC s July 29 order on the petition on rehearing still did not allow BGE to defer or recover through a surcharge the increase in Baltimore City underground conduit fees.  
  On August 26, 2016, BGE filed an appeal of the MDPSC s orders with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August
29, 2016, the residential consumer advocate also filed an appeal of the MDPSC s order but with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. BGE cannot predict the outcomes of these appeals. Refer to the Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investment disclosure
below for further details on the impact of the ultimate disallowances contained in the orders to BGE.   
    Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and BGE).      In August 2010, the MDPSC
approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE that included the planned installation of 2 million residential and commercial electric and natural gas smart meters at an expected total cost of $480 million of which $200 million was funded by
SGIG. The MDPSC s approval ordered BGE to defer the associated incremental costs, depreciation and amortization, and an appropriate return, in a regulatory asset until such time as a cost-effective advanced metering system is implemented. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of BGE s regulatory asset was $235 million and $196 million, respectively, representing incremental program deployment costs. The current quarter balance of $235 million consists
of three major components, including $148 million of unamortized incremental deployment costs of the AMI program, $55 million of unamortized costs of the non-AMI meters replaced under the program, and $32 million related to post-test year
incremental program deployment costs incurred prior to approval became effective June 2016. The balance as of September 30, 2016 reflects the impact of the cost disallowances and adjustments discussed below. The incremental deployment
costs for the AMI program and the non-AMI meter components of the regulatory asset are being recovered through rates and amortized to expense over a 10 year period, while the post-test year incremental program deployment costs have not yet been
approved for recovery by the MDPSC. A return on the regulatory asset is currently included in rates, except for the $55 million portion representing the unamortized cost of the retired non-AMI meters and a $32 million portion related to
post-test year incremental program deployment costs.      As part of the 2015 electric and natural gas
distribution rate case filed on November 6, 2015, BGE sought recovery of its smart grid initiative costs, supported by evidence demonstrating that BGE had, in fact, implemented a cost-beneficial advanced metering system. On June 3, 2016, the MDPSC
issued an order concluding that the smart grid initiative overall is cost beneficial to its customers. However, the June 3 order contained several cost disallowances and adjustments including disallowances of certain program and meter
installation costs and denial of recovery of any return on unrecovered costs for non-AMI meters replaced under the program. On June 30, 2016, BGE filed a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order requesting that the MDPSC modify its order to
reverse certain decisions and change certain of the cost disallowances and adjustments to enable BGE to defer those costs for recovery through future electric and natural gas rates. OPC also subsequently filed for a petition for rehearing of
the June 3 order. On July 29, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order on the petitions for rehearing that reversed certain of its prior cost disallowances and adjustments related to the smart grid initiative. On August 26, 2016, BGE filed an appeal of
the MDPSC s orders with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August 29, 2016, the residential consumer advocate also filed an appeal of the MDPSC s order but with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. BGE cannot predict the outcomes
of these appeals.      As a combined result of the MDPSC orders, BGE recorded a $52 million charge to Operating
and maintenance expense in Exelon s and BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income

reducing certain regulatory assets and other long-lived assets. Pursuant to the combined MDPSC orders, BGE also reclassified $55 million of non-AMI plant costs from Property, plant and equipment,
net to Regulatory assets on Exelon s and BGE s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016. For further information, see Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K.   
    2013 Maryland Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).      On
May 17, 2013, and as amended on August 23, 2013, BGE filed for electric and natural gas base increases with the MDPSC. In addition to these requested rate increases, BGE s application also included a request for recovery of incremental
capital expenditures and operating costs associated with BGE s proposed short-term reliability improvement plan (the ERI initiative) in response to a MDPSC order through a surcharge separate from base rates.   
  On December 13, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order authorizing BGE to recover through a surcharge mechanism costs
associated with five ERI initiative programs designed to accelerate electric reliability improvements premised upon the condition that the MDPSC approve specific projects in advance of cost recovery. As of September 30, 2016, BGE has received
approval of its updated surcharge filings three times for rates to be effective in 2014, 2015 and 2016.      In
January 2014, the residential consumer advocate in Maryland filed an appeal to the order issued by the MDPSC on December 13, 2013 in BGE s 2013 electric and natural gas distribution rate cases. The residential consumer advocate filed its
related legal memorandum on August 22, 2014, challenging the MDPSC s approval of the ERI initiative surcharge. BGE submitted a response to the appeal on October 15, 2014, and a hearing was held on November 17, 2014. On October 26, 2015,
the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an order affirming the MDPSC decision. However, on November 23, 2015, the residential consumer advocate filed an appeal of the Circuit Court s decision with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. On
March 7, 2016, the consumer advocate withdrew its appeal and no further action is expected.        MDPSC New
Generation Contract Requirement (Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, Pepco and DPL).          On April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued an order that requires BGE, Pepco and DPL (collectively, the Contract EDCs) to negotiate
and enter into a contract with the winning bidder of a competitive bidding process to build one new power plant in the range of 650 to 700 MWs beginning in 2015, in amounts proportional to their relative SOS loads. Under the terms of the order, the
winning bidder was to construct a 661 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle generation plant in Waldorf, Maryland, with an expected commercial operation date of June 1, 2015, and each of the Contract EDCs was to recover its costs associated with the
contract through surcharges on its respective SOS customers.      In response to a complaint filed by a group of
generating companies in the PJM region, on September 30, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a ruling that the MDPSC s April 2012 order violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to
regulate wholesale prices. In contrast, on October 1, 2013, in response to appeals filed by the Contract EDCs and other parties, the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City upheld the MDPSC s orders requiring the Contract EDCs to enter into
the contracts.      On October 24, 2013, the Federal district court issued an order ruling that the contracts are
illegal and unenforceable. In November 2013 both the winning bidder and the MDPSC appealed the Federal district court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the lower Federal court ruling. On November 26, 2014,
both the winning bidder and the MDPSC petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to consider hearing an appeal of the Fourth Circuit decision. On October 19, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the decision. On April 19, 2016, the U.S. Supreme
Court unanimously affirmed the Fourth Circuit s ruling upholding the Federal district court s decision.

   The decision of the Maryland Circuit Court was appealed to the Maryland
Court of Special Appeals and was stayed pending decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 1, 2016, the Contract EDCs submitted a filing requesting that the MDPSC take notice of the U.S. Supreme Court s decision, and notifying the MDPSC that
the Contract EDCs will dismiss their appeal pending at the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. On September 14, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals dismissed the pending appeal and the matter is considered closed.   
   Delaware Regulatory Matters         2016 Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and DPL).      On May 17, 2016, DPL filed an application with the DPSC to increase its annual electric
and natural gas distribution base rates by $63 million and $22 million, respectively, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. While the DPSC is not required to issue a decision on the application within a specified period of time, Delaware law allowed
DPL to put into effect $2.5 million of the rate increase two months after filing the applications which were effective July 16, 2016. It also allows the entire requested rate increase seven months after filing, subject to a cap and a refund
obligation based on the final DPSC order. DPL cannot predict how much of the requested increase the DPSC will approve.       District of
Columbia Regulatory Matters         2016 Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and
Pepco).      On June 30, 2016, Pepco filed an application with the DCPSC to increase its annual electric distribution base rates by $86 million, which was updated to $82 million on October 14, 2016, based on a requested ROE
of 10.6%. The DCPSC has issued a procedural schedule indicating a final decision will be issued by July 25, 2017. Any adjustments to its rates approved by the DCPSC are expected to take effect soon thereafter. Pepco cannot predict how much of the
requested increase the DCPSC will approve.      On April 18, 2016, a party to a separate DCPSC proceeding filed a
motion to suspend Pepco s bill stabilization adjustment (BSA), which decouples distribution revenues from utility customers from the amount of electricity delivered. On September 9, 2016, the DCPSC denied the party s motion and determined
that the appropriate forum in which to determine whether the BSA continues to be just and reasonable is in Pepco s rate case proceeding. In addition, the DCPSC stated that it was putting Pepco on notice that all funds collected for the BSA from
January 2015 to the issuance of a decision in the rate case proceeding are subject to refund should the DCPSC determine that such funds were not justly or reasonably collected. On October 7, 2016, Pepco filed for reconsideration of this order and
requested clarification that the order was not final and that the BSA matter would be decided in the base rate case. Pepco also argued that, if the order were considered final, the DCPSC reconsider its ruling that funds collected from the BSA can be
retroactively refunded. Pepco cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the impact of a refund if ordered by the DCPSC.        District of Columbia Power Line Undergrounding Initiative (Exelon, PHI and Pepco).      In May 2014, the Council of the District of Columbia enacted the Electric Company
Infrastructure Improvement Financing Act of 2014 (the Improvement Financing Act), which provided enabling legislation for the District of Columbia Power Line Undergrounding (DC PLUG) initiative which would selectively place underground some of the
District of Columbia s most outage-prone power lines.      The Improvement Financing Act provides that:
(i) Pepco is to fund approximately $500 million of the estimated cost to complete the DC PLUG initiative, recovering those costs through a volumetric surcharge on the electric bills of Pepco District of Columbia customers; (ii) $375
million of the DC PLUG initiative cost is to be financed by the District of Columbia s issuance of securitized bonds, which bonds will be repaid through a volumetric surcharge (the DDOT surcharge) on the electric bills of Pepco District of
Columbia customers that Pepco will remit to the District of Columbia; and (iii) the remaining costs up to $125 million are to be covered by

the existing capital projects program of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT). Pepco will not earn a return on or a return of the cost of the assets funded with the
proceeds of the securitized bonds or assets that are constructed by DDOT under its capital projects program, but ownership and responsibility for the operation and maintenance of such assets will be transferred to Pepco for a nominal amount.
     In June 2014, Pepco and DDOT filed a Triennial Plan related to the construction of selected underground
feeders in the District of Columbia. In August 2014, Pepco filed an application for the issuance of a financing order to provide for the issuance of the District s bonds. In March 2016, the DCPSC s orders approving the Triennial Plan and
the application for financing were upheld upon the resolution of appeals that had been filed with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. In compliance with the Improvement Financing Act, on September 30, 2016, Pepco and DDOT filed a Second
Triennial Plan. Recognizing the delays to the First Triennial Plan, Pepco and DDOT requested that the DCPSC hold the Second Triennial Plan in abeyance.      In June 2015, an agency of the federal government served by Pepco asserted that the DDOT surcharge constitutes a tax on end users from which the federal government is immune. PHI is currently evaluating
the assertion and the resolution of this matter will likely further delay implementation of the DC PLUG initiative.       New Jersey Regulatory
Matters         2016 Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and
ACE).      On August 24, 2016, the NJBPU issued an order approving a stipulation of settlement among ACE, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, NJBPU Staff and Unimin Corporation, and an increase of $45 million (before
New Jersey sales and use tax) to its electric distribution base rates, with the new rates effective immediately. The stipulation of settlement provided that a determination on PowerAhead would be separated into a phase II of the rate proceeding and
decided at a later date and the parties would seek to resolve the matter by the end of 2016, although resolution will most likely occur in the first quarter of 2017. PowerAhead includes capital investments to advance modernization of the electric
grid through energy efficiency, increased distributed generation, and resiliency, focused on improving the distribution system s ability to withstand major storm events. ACE cannot predict if the NJBPU will approve the PowerAhead initiative.
       Update and Reconciliation of Certain Under-Recovered Balances (Exelon, PHI and
ACE).           O n February 1, 2016, ACE submitted its 2016 annual petition with the NJBPU seeking to reconcile and update (i) charges related to the recovery of above-market costs associated with
ACE s long-term power purchase contracts with the NUGs and (ii) costs related to surcharges for the New Jersey Societal Benefit Program (a statewide public interest program that is intended to benefit low income customers and address other
public policy goals) and ACE s uncollectible accounts.      The net impact of adjusting the charges as
proposed is an overall annual rate increase of $9 million (revised to $19 million in April 2016, based upon an update for actuals through March 2016), including New Jersey sales and use tax. The matter is pending at the NJBPU.   
   New York Regulatory Matters         New York Clean Energy Standard (Exelon, Generation).          On August 1, 2016, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) issued an order establishing the
Clean Energy Standard (CES), a component of which includes creation of a Tier 3 Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of zero-emissions nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet the criteria
demonstrating public necessity as determined by the NYPSC. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) will centrally procure the ZECs from eligible plants through a 12-year contract, to be administered in six two-year
tranches, extending from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2029. ZEC payments will be made to the eligible resources based upon the number of MWh produced, subject to   
         85

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

specified caps and minimum performance requirements. The price to be paid for the ZECs under each tranche will be administratively determined using a formula based on the social cost of carbon as
determined by the federal government. The ZEC price for the first tranche has been set at $17.48 per MWh of production. Following the first tranche, the price will be updated bi-annually. Each Load Serving Entity (LSE) shall be required to purchase
an amount of ZECs equivalent to its load ratio share of the total electric energy in the New York Control Area. Cost recovery from ratepayers shall be incorporated into the commodity charges on customer bills. The CES initially identifies the three
plants eligible for the ZEC program to include, for now, the FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point nuclear facilities. The program specifically provides that Nine Mile Point Units 1   2 qualify jointly as a single facility and if either
unit permanently ceases operations then both units will no longer qualify for ZEC payments for the remainder of the program. As issued, the order provides that the duration of the program beyond the first tranche is conditional upon a buyer
purchasing the FitzPatrick facility and taking title prior to September 1, 2018; however, Generation and CENG requested clarification, or in the alternative limited rehearing, that this condition is applicable to the FitzPatrick facility only and
has no bearing on the 12-year duration of the program for Ginna or Nine Mile Point. To date, several parties have filed with the NYPSC requests for rehearing or reconsideration of the CES and on October 19, 2016, a coalition of fossil generation
companies filed a complaint in federal district court against the NYPSC alleging that the ZEC program violates certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution; specifically that the ZEC program interferes with FERC s jurisdiction over wholesale
rates and that it discriminates against out of state competitors. Generation and CENG will seek to intervene in the case and to dismiss the lawsuit. Other legal challenges remain possible and the outcomes of each of these challenges are
currently uncertain. Negotiations with NYSERDA regarding contracts for the sale of ZECs from Ginna, Nine Mile Point and FitzPatrick are ongoing, and Generation expects that NYSERDA will enter into final agreements during the fourth quarter of 2016.
See Note 7   Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional information relative to Ginna and Nine Mile Point. See Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information on Generation s
proposed acquisition of FitzPatrick.        Ginna Nuclear Power Plant Reliability Support Services Agreement
(Exelon and Generation).      In November 2014, in response to a petition filed by Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (Ginna) regarding the possible retirement of Ginna, the NYPSC directed Ginna and Rochester Gas   Electric
Company (RG E) to negotiate a Reliability Support Services Agreement (RSSA) to support the continued operation of Ginna to maintain the reliability of the RG E transmission grid for a specified period of time. During 2015 and 2016, Ginna and
RG E made filings with the NYPSC and FERC for their approval of the proposed RSSA. Although the RSSA was still subject to regulatory approvals, on April 1, 2015, Ginna began delivering the power and capacity from the Ginna plant into the
ISO-NY consistent with the technical provisions of the RSSA.      On March 22, 2016, Ginna submitted a compliance
filing with FERC with revisions to the RSSA requested by FERC. On April 8, 2016, FERC accepted the compliance filing and on April 20, 2016, the NYPSC accepted the revised RSSA. Because all regulatory approvals for the RSSA have now been
received, Generation began recognizing revenue based on the final approved pricing contained in the RSSA. Generation also recognized a one-time revenue adjustment in April 2016 of approximately $101 million representing the net cumulative previously
unrecognized amount of revenue retroactive from the April 1, 2015 effective date through March 31, 2016. A 49.99% portion of the one-time adjustment will be removed from Generation s results as a result of the noncontrolling interests in
CENG.      The RSSA approved by the regulatory authorities has a term expiring on March 31, 2017, subject to
possible extension in the event that RG E needs additional time to complete transmission upgrades to address reliability concerns. In March 2016, RG E notified Ginna that RG E expects to complete the transmission upgrades prior to the
RSSA expiration in March 2017 and will not need Ginna as an ongoing reliability solution after that date.      The
approved RSSA requires Ginna to continue operating through the RSSA term. If Ginna does not plan to retire shortly after the expiration of the RSSA, Ginna is required to file a notice to that effect with the NYPSC no

later than September 30, 2016. Under the terms of the RSSA, if Ginna continues to operate after June 14, 2017, Ginna would be required to make certain refund payments up to a maximum of
$20 million to RG E related to capital expenditures. On September 30, 2016, Ginna filed the required notice with the NYPSC of its intent to continue operating beyond the March 31, 2017 expiry of the RSSA, conditioned upon successful execution of
an agreement between Ginna and NYSERDA for the sale of ZECs under the CES. As a result, Ginna has reserved the right to withdraw this notification and cease commercial operations if the ZEC program is terminated, suspended, or stayed prior to
commencement of the program on April 1, 2017 or if for any reason a contract with NYSERDA in a form and substance satisfactory to Generation and CENG is not executed for Ginna, Nine Mile Point, or FitzPatrick. Negotiations with NYSERDA are ongoing
and contract execution is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of 2016.      There remains an
increased risk that, for economic reasons, Ginna could be retired before the end of its operating license period in 2029. In the event the plant were to be retired before the current license term ends in 2029, Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations could be adversely affected by the accelerated future decommissioning costs, severance costs, increased depreciation rates, and impairment charges, among other items. See Note 7-Early Nuclear Plant Retirements
for further information regarding the impacts of a decision to early retire one or more nuclear plants.       Federal Regulatory Matters
        Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and
ACE).      ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are required to file an annual
update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, with the resulting rates effective on June 1 of the same year. The annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions. The update
also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1 of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and
corresponding increases or decreases to operating revenues for any differences between the revenue requirement in effect and ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be
filed with the FERC for that year s reconciliation. The regulatory asset associated with transmission true-up is amortized to Operating revenues within their Consolidated Statements of Operations of Comprehensive Income as the associated
amounts are recovered through rates.      The following total increases/(decreases) were included in ComEd s,
BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s electric transmission formula rate filings:

(b)  
    BGE s transmission revenues include a FERC approved dedicated facilities charge to recover the costs of providing transmission service to
specifically designated load by BGE.      

(c)  
    In 2012, PJM terminated the MAPP transmission line construction project planned for the Pepco and DPL service territories. Pursuant to a FERC
approved settlement agreement, the abandonment costs associated with MAPP were being recovered in transmission rates over a three-year period that ended in May 2016.      

(d)  
    Refers to the weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate bases.      

(e)  
    As part of the FERC-approved settlement of ComEd s 2007 transmission rate case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.50% and the common
equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the transmission formula rate is currently capped at 55%. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of the ROE complaint against BGE, Pepco, DPL and
ACE, the rate of return on common equity is 10.50%, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive adder for being a member of a regional transmission organization.      
  For additional information regarding ComEd and BGE s transmission formula rate filings see Note
3  Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K. For additional information regarding Pepco, DPL and ACE s transmission formula rate filings see Note 7   Regulatory Matters of the PHI 2015 Form 10-K.   
    PJM Transmission Rate Design and Operating Agreements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and
ACE).      PJM Transmission Rate Design specifies the rates for transmission service charged to customers within PJM. Currently, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE incur costs based on the existing rate design, which
charges customers based on the cost of the existing transmission facilities within their load zone and the cost of new transmission facilities based on those who benefit from those facilities. In April 2007, FERC issued an order concluding that
PJM s current rate design for existing facilities is just and reasonable and should not be changed. In the same order, FERC held that the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above should be socialized across the entire PJM footprint and that the
costs of new facilities less than 500 kV should be allocated to the customers of the new facilities who caused the need for those facilities. A number of parties appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for review of the
decision.      In August 2009, the court issued its decision affirming the FERC s order with regard to the
existing facilities, but remanded to FERC the issue of the cost allocation associated with the new facilities 500 kV and above (Cost Allocation Issue) for further consideration by the FERC. On remand, FERC reaffirmed its earlier decision to
socialize the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above. A number of parties filed appeals of these orders. In June 2014, the court again remanded the Cost Allocation Issue to FERC. On December 18, 2014, FERC issued an order setting an evidentiary
hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the Cost Allocation Issue. On June 15, 2016, a number of parties, including Exelon and the Utility Registrants filed an Offer of Settlement with FERC. Each state that is a party in this proceeding
either signed, or will not oppose, the settlement. On July 5, 2016, a number of merchant transmission owners and load servicing entities opposed the Settlement in whole or in part. As of September 30, 2016, the Settlement is
awaiting FERC s action. If the Settlement is approved, effective January 1, 2016, for the costs of the 500 kV facilities approved by the PJM Board on or after February 1, 2013, 50% will be socialized across PJM and 50% will be allocated
according to an engineering formula that calculates the flows on the transmission facilities. The Settlement includes provisions for monthly credits or charges that are expected to be mostly refunded or recovered through customer rates over a
10-year period based on negotiated numbers for charges prior to January 1, 2016.      Exelon expects that the
Settlement will not have a material impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL or ACE. The Settlement is subject to approval by FERC.   
    Operating License Renewals (Exelon and Generation).      Generation has 40-year operating
licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC s review.

   On December 9, 2014, Generation submitted an application to the NRC
to extend the current operating licenses of LaSalle Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. On October 19, 2016, the NRC approved Generation s request to extend the operating licenses of LaSalle Unit 1 and 2 by 20 years to 2042 and 2043, respectively.
     On August 29, 2012, Generation submitted a hydroelectric license application to FERC for a 46-year
license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo). In connection with Generation s efforts to obtain a water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act with Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE)
for Conowingo, Generation continues to work with MDE and other stakeholders to resolve water quality licensing issues, including: (1) water quality, (2) fish habitat, and (3) sediment. In addition, Generation continues to work with MDE and other
Federal and Maryland state agencies to conduct and fund an additional sediment and nutrient monitoring study.   
  On August 7, 2015, US Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior (Interior) submitted its modified
fishway prescription to FERC in the Conowingo licensing proceedings. On September 11, 2015, Exelon filed a request for an administrative hearing and proposed an alternative prescription to challenge Interior s preliminary prescription. On April
21, 2016, Exelon and Interior executed a Settlement Agreement resolving all fish passage issues between the parties. Accordingly, on April 22, 2016, Exelon withdrew its Request for a Trial-Type Hearing and Alternative Prescription. The
financial impact of the Settlement Agreement is estimated to be $3 million to $7 million per year, on average, over the 46-year life of the new license, including both capital and operating costs. The actual timing and amount of these costs are not
currently fixed and may vary significantly from year to year throughout the life of the new license. Resolution of the remaining issues relating to Conowingo involving various stakeholders may have a material effect on Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations and financial position through an increase in capital expenditures and operating costs. As of September 30, 2016, $27 million of direct costs associated with the Conowingo licensing effort have been
capitalized. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on Generation s operating license renewal efforts.       Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)       Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE each prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation. Under
this guidance, regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that
have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs.   
  As a result of applying the acquisition method of accounting and pushing it down to the consolidated financial statements
of PHI, certain regulatory assets and liabilities were established at Exelon and PHI to offset the impacts of fair valuing the acquired assets and liabilities assumed which are subject to regulatory recovery. In total, Exelon and PHI recorded a net
$2.4 billion regulatory asset reflecting adjustments recorded as a result of the acquisition method of accounting. See Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information.

bypassable transmission service charges. As of December 31, 2015, PECO s regulatory liability of $60 million included $35 million related to over-recovered costs under the DSP program,
$22 million related to the over-recovered natural gas costs under the PGC and $3 million related to the over-recovered electric transmission costs.          Purchase of Receivables Programs (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE)       ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are required, under separate legislation and regulations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia and New Jersey, to purchase certain receivables from
retail electric and natural gas suppliers that participate in the utilities  consolidated billing. ComEd, BGE, Pepco and DPL purchase receivables at a discount to recover primarily uncollectible accounts expense from the suppliers. PECO is
required to purchase receivables at face value and is permitted to recover uncollectible accounts expense, including those from Third Party Suppliers, from customers through distribution rates. ACE purchases receivables at face value. ACE recovers
all uncollectible accounts expense, including those from Third Party Suppliers, through the Societal Benefits Charge (SBC) rider, which includes uncollectible accounts expense as a component. The SBC is filed annually with the NJBPU. Exelon,
ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not record unbilled commodity receivables under the POR programs. Purchased billed receivables are classified in Other accounts receivable, net on Exelon s, ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s,
PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables provide information about the purchased receivables of those companies as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

(a)  
    For ComEd, BGE, Pepco and DPL, reflects the incremental allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded, which is in addition to the purchase
discount. For ComEd, the incremental uncollectible accounts expense is recovered through its Purchase of Receivables with Consolidated Billing tariff.      

(b)  
    PECO s natural gas POR program became effective on January 1, 2012 and included a 1% discount on purchased receivables in order to recover
the implementation costs of the program. The implementation costs were fully recovered and the 1% discount was reset to 0%, effective July 2015.      

(c)  
    Pepco s electric POR program in Maryland included a discount on purchased receivables ranging from 0% to 2% depending on customer class, and
Pepco s electric POR program in the District of Columbia included a discount on purchased receivables ranging from 0% to 6% depending on customer class. DPL s electric POR program in Maryland included a discount on purchased receivables
ranging from 0% to 1% depending on customer class.      
     6.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Exelon and Generation)    
    Long-Lived Assets (Exelon and Generation)     
  During the first quarter of 2016, significant changes in Generation s intended use of the Upstream oil and gas
assets, developments with nonrecourse debt held by its upstream subsidiary CEU Holdings, LLC (as described in Note 10   Debt and Credit Agreements) and continued declines in both production volumes and commodity prices suggested that
the carrying value may be impaired. Generation concluded that the estimated   
         94

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of its Upstream properties were less than their carrying values. As a result, a pre-tax impairment charge of $119 million was recorded in March 2016
within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. On June 16, 2016, Generation initiated the sales process of its Upstream business by executing a
forbearance agreement with the lenders of the nonrecourse debt, see Note 10   Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information. As a result, the Upstream assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale on Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016. See Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information. An additional pre-tax impairment charge of $15 million was recorded in
September 2016 within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income due to further declines in fair value.   
  Further declines in commodity prices or further developments with Generation s intended use or disposition of the
assets could potentially result in future impairments of the Upstream assets.      Generation evaluates long-lived
assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the second quarter of 2016, updates to the Company s long-term view of energy and capacity prices suggested that
the carrying value of a group of merchant wind assets, located in West Texas, may be impaired. Upon review, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of the group were less than their carrying value. The fair value analysis was
based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. As a result of the fair value analysis, long-lived merchant
wind assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $60 million were written down to their fair value of $24 million and a pre-tax impairment charge of $36 million was recorded during the second quarter in Operating and maintenance
expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
  Also in the second quarter of 2016, updates to the Company s long-term view, as described above, in conjunction with
the retirement announcements of the Quad Cities and Clinton nuclear plants in Illinois suggested that the carrying value of our Midwest asset group may be impaired. Generation completed a comprehensive review of the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows of the Midwest asset group and no impairment charge was required.        Like-Kind Exchange Transaction
(Exelon)        In June 2000, UII, LLC (formerly Unicom Investments, Inc.) (UII), a wholly owned subsidiary
of Exelon Corporation, entered into transactions pursuant to which UII invested in coal-fired generating station leases (Headleases) with the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG). The generating stations were leased back to MEAG as part of
the transactions (Leases).      On March 31, 2016, UII and MEAG finalized an agreement to terminate the MEAG
Headleases, the MEAG Leases, and other related agreements prior to their expiration dates. As a result of the lease termination, UII received an early termination payment of $360 million from MEAG and wrote-off the $356 million net investment in the
MEAG Headleases and the Leases. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4 million which is reflected in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note
11   Income Taxes for additional information.         7.    Early Nuclear Plant
Retirements (Exelon and Generation)       Exelon and Generation continue to evaluate the current and expected
economic value of each of Generation s nuclear plants. Factors that will continue to affect the economic value of Generation s nuclear plants include, but are not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential
legislative and

regulatory solutions to ensure nuclear plants are fairly compensated for their carbon-free emissions, and the impact of final rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions
and the efforts of states to implement those final rules.      In 2015, Generation identified the Quad Cities,
Clinton and Ginna nuclear plants as having the greatest risk of early retirement based on economic valuation and other factors. At that time, Exelon and Generation deferred retirement decisions on Clinton and Quad Cities until 2016 in order to
participate in the 2016-2017 MISO primary reliability auction and the 2019-2020 PJM capacity auctions held in April and May 2016, respectively, as well as to provide Illinois policy makers with additional time to consider needed reforms and for MISO
to consider market design changes to ensure long-term power system reliability in southern Illinois.      In April
2016, Clinton cleared the MISO primary reliability auction as a price taker for the 2016-2017 planning year. The resulting capacity price is insufficient to cover cash operating costs and a risk-adjusted rate of return to shareholders. In May 2016,
Quad Cities did not clear in the PJM capacity auction for the 2019-2020 planning year and will not receive capacity revenue for that period.      Based on these capacity auction results, and given the lack of progress on Illinois energy legislation and MISO market reforms, on June 2, 2016 Generation announced it will move forward to shut down the
Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants on June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, respectively. The current Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licenses for Clinton and Quad Cities expire in 2026 and 2032, respectively. Generation is proceeding with the
market and regulatory notifications that must be made to shut down the plants, including notification to the NRC on June 20, 2016, and filing of a deactivation notice with PJM for Quad Cities on July 6, 2016. Generation will formally notify MISO of
its plans to close Clinton later this year.      In 2016, as a result of the plant retirement decision for Clinton
and Quad Cities, Exelon and Generation recognized one-time charges in Operating and maintenance expense of $146 million related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs and construction work-in-progress (CWIP)
impairments, among other items. In addition to these one-time charges, there will be ongoing annual incremental non-cash charges to earnings stemming from shortening the expected economic useful life of Clinton and Quad Cities primarily related to
accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any asset retirement costs (ARC)), accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, and additional asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning timing
and cost assumptions. Through September 30, 2016, Exelon s and Generation s results include an incremental $443 million of pre-tax expense for these items as summarized in the table below. Please refer to Note 12   Nuclear
Decommissioning for additional detail on changes to the Nuclear decommissioning ARO balances resulting from the early retirement of Clinton and Quad Cities.

    For Quad Cities based on the regulatory agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission, decommissioning-related activities are offset within
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to ComEd at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd.
Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and corresponding regulatory liability.

   The Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant also did not clear in the May
2016 PJM capacity auction for the 2019-2020 planning year and will not receive capacity revenue for that period. This is the second consecutive year that TMI failed to clear the capacity auction. Although the plant is committed to operate through
May 2019, the plant faces continued economic challenges and Exelon and Generation are exploring all options to return it to profitability. While a portion of the Byron nuclear plant s capacity did not clear the PJM 2019-2020 planning year
capacity auction, the plant is committed to run through May 2020. The company s other nuclear plants in PJM cleared in the auction, except Oyster Creek, which did not participate in the auction given Exelon s and Generation s previous
commitment to cease operation of the Oyster Creek nuclear plant by the end of 2019.      In New York, the Ginna
and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants continue to face significant economic challenges and risk of retirement before the end of each unit s respective operating license period (2029 for Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1, and 2046 for Nine Mile
Point Unit 2). On August 1, 2016, NYPSC issued an order adopting the Clean Energy Standard (CES), which would provide payments to Ginna and Nine Mile Point for the environmental attributes of their production. Subject to Ginna and Nine Mile
Point entering into a satisfactory contract with the NYSERDA, as required under the CES, and subject to prevailing over any administrative or legal challenges, the CES will allow Ginna and Nine Mile Point to continue to operate at least through the
life of the program (March 31, 2029). The approved RSSA currently requires Ginna to continue operating through the RSSA term expiring in March 2017. If Ginna does not plan to retire shortly after the expiration of the RSSA, notification to
that effect was required to be filed with the NYPSC no later than September 30, 2016. On September 30, 2016, Ginna filed the required notice with the NYPSC of its intent to continue operating beyond the March 31, 2017 expiry of the RSSA,
conditioned upon successful execution of an agreement between Ginna and NYSERDA for the sale of ZECs under the CES. Negotiations with NYSERDA are ongoing and contract execution is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Refer to Note 5   Regulatory Matters for additional discussion on the Ginna RSSA and the New York CES.      The following table provides the balance sheet amounts as of September 30, 2016 for significant assets and liabilities associated with the three nuclear plants currently considered by management to
be at the greatest risk of early retirement due to current economic valuations and other factors.       
    Assuming the successful implementation of the CES and its continued effectiveness,
Generation and CENG would no longer consider Ginna and Nine Mile Point to be at heightened risk of early retirement; however, absent the CES for the full expected duration they will remain at heightened risk. The precise timing of an early
retirement date for any of these plants, and the resulting financial statement impacts, may be affected by a number of factors, including the status of potential regulatory or legislative solutions, results of any transmission system reliability
study assessments, the nature of any co-owner requirements and stipulations, and decommissioning trust fund requirements, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does
not have capacity obligations, where applicable, and just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage.

    Short-Term Liabilities.     The short-term
liabilities included in the tables above are comprised of dividends payable (included in other current liabilities) (Level 1) and short-term borrowings (Level 2). The Registrants  carrying amounts of the short-term liabilities are
representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.       Long-Term
Debt.     The fair value amounts of Exelon s taxable debt securities (Level 2) and private placement taxable debt securities (Level 3) are determined by a valuation model that is based on a conventional discounted cash
flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. In order to incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants into the discount rates, Exelon obtains pricing (i.e., U.S. Treasury rate plus credit spread) based on trades of
existing Exelon debt securities as well as debt securities of other issuers in the electric utility sector with similar credit ratings in both the primary and secondary market, across the Registrants  debt maturity spectrum. The credit spreads
of various tenors obtained from this information are added to the appropriate benchmark U.S. Treasury rates in order to determine the current market yields for the various tenors. The yields are then converted into discount rates of various tenors
that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note. Due to low trading volume of private placement debt, qualitative factors such as market conditions, low volume of investors and investor demand, this
debt is classified as Level 3. The fair value of Exelon s equity units (Level 1) are valued based on publicly traded securities issued by Exelon.      The fair value of Generation s and PHI s non-government-backed fixed rate nonrecourse debt (Level 3) is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk
profiles. Given the low trading volume in the nonrecourse debt market, the price quotes used to determine fair value will reflect certain qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, new developments that might significantly
impact the project cash flows or off-taker credit, and other circumstances related to the project (e.g., political and regulatory environment). The fair value of Generation s government-backed fixed rate project financing debt (Level 3) is
largely based on a discounted cash flow methodology that is similar to the taxable debt securities methodology described above. Due to the lack of market trading data on similar debt, the discount rates are derived based on the original loan
interest rate spread to the applicable Treasury rate as well as a current market curve derived from government-backed securities. Variable rate project financing debt resets on a monthly or quarterly basis and the carrying value approximates fair
value (Level 2). When trading data is available on variable rate project financing debt, the fair value is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk profiles (Level 2). Generation, Pepco,
DPL and ACE also have tax-exempt debt (Level 2). Due to low trading volume in this market, qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to the issuer (e.g., conduit issuer political and regulatory
environment), may be incorporated into the credit spreads that are used to obtain the fair value as described above. Variable rate tax-exempt debt (Level 2) resets on a regular basis and the carrying value approximates fair value.   
   SNF Obligation .    The carrying amount of Generation s SNF obligation (Level 2) is
derived from a contract with the DOE to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. When determining the fair value of the obligation, the future carrying amount of the SNF obligation estimated to be settled in
2025 is calculated by compounding the current book value of the SNF obligation at the 13-week Treasury rate. The compounded obligation amount is discounted back to present value using Generation s discount rate, which is calculated using the
same methodology as described above for the taxable debt securities, and an estimated maturity date of 2025.   
   Long-Term Debt to Financing Trusts .    Exelon s long-term debt to financing trusts is
valued based on publicly traded securities issued by the financing trusts. Due to low trading volume of these securities, qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to each issue, this debt is
classified as Level 3.

    Preferred Stock .    The fair value of these
securities is determined based on the carrying value of the shares per the Subscription Agreement between PHI and Exelon. See Note 16   Mezzanine Equity for further details.   
    Recurring Fair Value Measurements        Exelon records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established by the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:       

Level 1   quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to
liquidate as of the reporting date.          

Level 2   inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or
indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.          

Level 3   unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due
to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.         Transfers in and out of levels
are recognized as of the end of the reporting period when the transfer occurred. Given derivatives categorized within Level 1 are valued using exchange-based quoted prices within observable periods, transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 were not
material. Additionally, there were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for cash equivalents, nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, pledged assets for Zion Station
decommissioning, Rabbi trust investments, and deferred compensation obligations. For derivative contracts, transfers into Level 2 from Level 3 generally occur when the contract tenor becomes more observable and due to changes in market liquidity or
assumptions for certain commodity contracts.       Generation and Exelon    
  In accordance with the applicable guidance on fair value measurement, certain investments that are measured at fair value
using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are no longer classified within the fair value hierarchy and are included under  Not subject to leveling  in the table below. See Note 2   New Accounting Pronouncements for
additional information.

    Other, net activity consists of realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in income for the NDT funds held by Generation and the life
insurance contracts held by Pepco.           Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value
       The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and
liabilities shown in the tables above.       Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco,
DPL and ACE).     The Registrants  cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in the fair value tables are comprised of investments in mutual
and money market funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.   
   Preferred Stock Derivative (PHI).     In connection with entering into the PHI Merger
Agreement, as further described in Note 16   Mezzanine Equity, PHI entered into a Subscription Agreement with Exelon dated April 29, 2014, pursuant to which PHI issued to Exelon shares of Preferred stock. The Preferred stock
contained embedded features requiring separate accounting consideration to reflect the potential value to PHI that any issued and outstanding Preferred stock could be called and redeemed at a nominal par value upon a termination of the merger
agreement under certain circumstances due to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. The embedded call and redemption features on the shares of the Preferred stock in the event of such a termination were separately accounted for as
derivatives. These Preferred stock derivatives were valued quarterly using quantitative and qualitative factors, including management s assessment of the likelihood of a Regulatory Termination and therefore, were categorized in Level 3 in the
fair value hierarchy. As a result of the PHI Merger, the PHI Preferred stock derivative was reduced to zero as of March 23, 2016. The write-off was charged to Other, net on the PHI Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Income.       Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets for Zion Station Decommissioning
(Exelon and Generation).     The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy Generation s and CENG s nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold debt and equity
securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and mutual funds, which are included in Equities, Fixed Income and Other. Generation s and CENG s NDT fund investments policies outline investment guidelines for the trusts and
limit the trust funds  exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities are
considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.

   With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain
prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Generation is able to independently corroborate. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds which are based
on quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1. Certain equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or
similar securities. Equity securities held individually are primarily traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ-Global Select Market, which contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these
exchanges.      For fixed income securities, multiple prices from pricing services are obtained whenever possible,
which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the
trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price
source is considered to be preferable. Generation has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Generation selectively corroborates the
fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. U.S. Treasury securities are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of fixed income securities, excluding U.S.
Treasury securities, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The fair values of private
placement fixed income securities, which are included in Corporate debt, are determined using a third party valuation that contains significant unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3.   
  Equity and fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain
investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives such as holding short term fixed income securities or tracking the performance of certain equity indices by purchasing equity securities to replicate the capitalization and
characteristics of the indices. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For commingled
funds and mutual funds, which are not publicly quoted, the funds are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value, which is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying securities, and are not classified
within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.      Derivative instruments consisting primarily of interest rate swaps to manage risk are recorded at fair value. Derivative instruments are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and
have been categorized as Level 2.      Middle market lending are investments in loans or managed funds which lend
to private companies. Generation elected the fair value option for its investments in certain limited partnerships that invest in middle market lending managed funds. The fair value of these loans is determined using a combination of valuation
models including cost models, market models and income models. Investments in loans are categorized as Level 3 because the fair value of these securities is based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. Managed
funds are valued using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Investments in middle market lending typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan.   
  Private equity and real estate investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies and
real estate holding companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange, such as, leveraged   
         117

buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, investments in natural resources, and direct investments in pools of real estate properties. The fair value of private equity and
real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period
of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date. Private equity and real estate valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results,
discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data, and independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. These valuation inputs are not highly observable.   
  As of September 30, 2016, Generation has outstanding commitments to invest in middle market lending, private equity
investments and real estate investments of approximately $170 million, $73 million, and $220 million, respectively. These commitments will be funded by Generation s existing nuclear decommissioning trust funds.   
   Concentrations of Credit Risk .    Generation evaluated its NDT portfolios for the existence of
significant concentrations of credit risk as of September 30, 2016. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual
fund. As of September 30, 2016, there were no significant concentrations (generally defined as greater than 10 percent) of risk in Generation s NDT assets.   
  See Note 12   Nuclear Decommissioning for further discussion on the NDT fund investments.   
   Rabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, Generation, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).     The Rabbi
trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts assets are included in investments in the
Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, fixed income securities and life insurance policies. The mutual funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in
accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the
prices. The fair values of fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2.
The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of mutual funds that are priced
based on observable market data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets. Life insurance policies that are valued using unobservable inputs
have been categorized as Level 3.       Mark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI and
DPL) .    Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the
fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives  pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the
bid-ask, mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an
orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an
industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of   
         118

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model
inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants  derivatives are predominately at liquid trading points. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information model
inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. Such
instruments are categorized in Level 3.      Exelon may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are
typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation
of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon determines the current fair value by calculating the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement, based on
and discounted by the market s expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and other market parameters. As these inputs are based on
observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion on mark-to-market derivatives.
      Deferred Compensation Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and
ACE).       The Registrants  deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent
liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants  deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants  notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are
comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds, and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active
market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.      The value of certain employment
agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred Compensation Obligation in the tables above) are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
       Additional Information Regarding Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI, Pepco and DPL)
        Mark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation and ComEd).       For
valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price
quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes
assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for
risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive
officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management
activities. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by the front office to manage the portfolio, are reviewed and verified by the middle office, and used for financial reporting by the back office. The Registrants consider credit and

nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of credit and nonperformance risk by
counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.   
  Disclosed below is detail surrounding the Registrants  significant Level 3 valuations. The calculated fair value
includes marketability discounts for margining provisions and other attributes. Generation s Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas and certain transmission congestion contracts. Generation
utilizes various inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and
factors include forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancements.   
  For commodity derivatives, the primary input to the valuation models is the forward commodity price curve for each
instrument. Forward commodity price curves are derived by risk management for liquid locations and by the traders and portfolio managers for illiquid locations. All locations are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published
exchange transaction prices, executed bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivatives depends on a number of factors, including commodity
type, delivery location, and delivery period. Price volatility varies by commodity and location. When appropriate, Generation discounts future cash flows using risk free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the credit quality of each
counterparty for assets and Generation s own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery locations including PJM
West Hub (for power) and Henry Hub (for natural gas) are more liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option
valuations. The forward curve for a less liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread does not typically
represent a majority of the instrument s market price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change in the spread is
generally immaterial. An average spread calculated across all Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately $2.81 and $0.36 for power and natural gas, respectively. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in nature and thus a
majority of the fair value may be based on observable inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3. See ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for information regarding the
maturity by year of the Registrants  mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities.      On
December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. See Note 9  Derivative Financial
Instruments for more information. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using natural gas heat rates to
project long term forward power curves adjusted by a renewable factor that incorporates time of day and seasonality factors to reflect accurate renewable energy pricing. In addition, marketability reserves are applied to the positions based on the
tenor and supplier risk.

   The inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of
the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Generation s commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is price volatility. Increases (decreases) in
the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions
(contracts that give Generation the obligation or right to sell a commodity). Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward
commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair
value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.   
   Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets for Zion Station Decommissioning (Exelon and
Generation).     For middle market lending and certain corporate debt securities investments, the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models and income
models. The valuation estimates are based on valuations of comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, estimating the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company or its assets, considering
offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company, its historical and projected financial results, as well as other factors that may impact value. Significant judgment is required in the application of discounts or premiums applied to the
prices of comparable companies for factors such as size, marketability, credit risk and relative performance.   
  Because Generation relies on third-party fund managers to develop the quantitative unobservable inputs without adjustment
for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Generation. This includes information regarding the sensitivity of the
fair values to changes in the unobservable inputs. Generation gains an understanding of the fund managers  inputs and assumptions used in preparing the valuations. Generation performed procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations.
For a sample of its Level 3 investments, Generation reviewed independent valuations and reviewed the assumptions in the detailed pricing models used by the fund managers.   
   Rabbi Trust Investments           Life insurance contracts (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL
and ACE).     For life insurance policies categorized as Level 3, the fair value is determined based on the cash surrender value of the policy, which contains unobservable inputs and assumptions. Because Exelon relies on its
third-party insurance provider to develop the inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to
Exelon. Exelon gains an understanding of the types of inputs and assumptions used in preparing the valuations and performs procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations.   

9.    Derivative   
     Financial Instruments (All Registrants)       
  The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest
rate risk related to ongoing business operations.        Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)     
  To the extent the amount of energy Generation produces differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon
and Generation are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities. Each of the Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks
  
         122

Table of Contents  

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options and short-term and long-term
commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products. The Registrants believe these instruments, which are classified as either economic hedges or non-derivatives, mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.   
  Derivative accounting guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair
value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings each period. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of
designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include normal purchase normal sale (NPNS), cash flow hedge and fair value hedge. For Generation, all derivative economic hedges related to commodities are
recorded at fair value through earnings for the combined company, referred to as economic hedges in the following tables. The Registrants have applied the NPNS scope exception to certain derivative contracts for the forward sale of generation, power
procurement agreements and natural gas supply agreements. Generation has also entered into bilateral long-term contractual obligations for sales of energy to load-serving entities, including electric utilities, municipalities, electric cooperatives
and retail load aggregators, as well as contractual obligations to deliver energy to market participants who primarily focus on the resale of energy products for delivery. These non-derivative contracts are accounted for primarily under the accrual
method of accounting. Additionally, Generation is exposed to certain market risks through its proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small
portion of Generation s overall energy marketing activities.       Economic
Hedging.     The Registrants are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities associated with price movements resulting from changes in
supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies and other factors. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. As such, Generation uses a variety of
derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power and gas sales, fuel and energy purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements and other
energy-related products marketed and purchased. In order to manage these risks, Generation may enter into fixed-price derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of energy and gas and
purchases of fuel and energy. The objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on electric generation operations, fixing the
price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of power plants, and fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply load-serving customers. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based
upon management s policies and hedging objectives, the market, weather conditions, operational and other factors. Generation is also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged
generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted
for on an accrual basis.      In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and
negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity price risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of September 30, 2016, the proportion
of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments is 98%-101%, 85%-88% and 54%-57% for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected
generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market
conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for

power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts including Generation s
sales to the Utility Registrants to serve their retail load.      On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into
several 20-year floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. These contracts are designed to lock in
a portion of the long-term commodity price risk resulting from the renewable energy resource procurement requirements in the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative financial instruments. ComEd
records the fair value of the swap contracts on its balance sheet. Because ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, the change in fair value each period is recorded by ComEd as a regulatory
asset or liability. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.      PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Programs, which are further discussed in Note
5   Regulatory Matters. Based on Pennsylvania legislation and the DSP Programs permitting PECO to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up, PECO s price risk related to electric supply
procurement is limited. PECO locked in fixed prices for a significant portion of its commodity price risk through full requirements contracts. PECO has certain full requirements contracts that are considered derivatives and qualify for the NPNS
scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance.      PECO s natural gas procurement policy
is designed to achieve a reasonable balance of long-term and short-term gas purchases under different pricing approaches in order to achieve system supply reliability at the least cost. PECO s reliability strategy is two-fold. First, PECO must
assure that there is sufficient transportation capacity to satisfy delivery requirements. Second, PECO must ensure that a firm source of supply exists to utilize the capacity resources. All of PECO s natural gas supply and asset management
agreements that are derivatives either qualify for the NPNS scope exception and have been designated as such, or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced. Additionally, in accordance with the 2016 PAPUC PGC settlement
and to reduce the exposure of PECO and its customers to natural gas price volatility, PECO has continued its program to purchase natural gas for both winter and summer supplies using a layered approach of locking-in prices ahead of each season with
long-term gas purchase agreements (those with primary terms of at least twelve months). Under the terms of the 2016 PGC settlement, PECO is required to lock in (i.e. economically hedge) the price of a minimum volume of its long-term gas commodity
purchases. PECO s gas-hedging program is designed to cover about 25% of planned natural gas purchases in support of projected firm sales. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on PECO s financial position or
results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.      BGE has
contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC. The SOS rates charged recover BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative
fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for commercial and industrial rate classes. BGE s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. BGE locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS
requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of BGE s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other BGE full requirements
contracts are not derivatives.      BGE provides natural gas to its customers under a MBR mechanism approved by
the MDPSC. Under this mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between
  
         124

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

shareholders and customers. BGE must also secure fixed price contracts for at least 10%, but not more than 20%, of forecasted system supply requirements for flowing (i.e. non-storage) gas for the
November through March period. These fixed-price contracts are not subject to sharing under the MBR mechanism. BGE also ensures it has sufficient pipeline transportation capacity to meet customer requirements. All of BGE s natural gas supply
and asset management agreements qualify for the NPNS scope exception and result in physical delivery.      Pepco
has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC. The SOS rates charged recover Pepco s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The
administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for residential and commercial rate classes. Pepco s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Pepco locks in fixed prices for all
of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of Pepco s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other Pepco
full requirements contracts are not derivatives.      DPL has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are
executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and the DPSC. The SOS rates charged recover DPL s wholesale power supply costs. In Delaware, DPL is also entitled to recover a Reasonable Allowance for Retail Margin
(RARM). The RARM includes a fixed annual margin of approximately $2.75 million, plus an incremental cost component and a cash working capital allowance. In Maryland, DPL charges an administrative fee intended to allow it to recover its
administrative costs. DPL locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. DPL s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Certain of DPL s full requirements contracts, which
are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other DPL full requirements contracts are not derivatives.   
  DPL provides natural gas to its customers under an Annual GCR mechanism approved by the DPSC. Under this mechanism,
DPL s Annual GCR Filing establishes a future GCR for firm bundled sales customers by using a forecast of demand and commodity costs. The actual costs are trued up versus the forecast on a monthly basis and any shortfall or excess is carried
forward as a recovery balance in the next GCR filing. The demand portion of the GCR is based upon DPL s firm transportation and storage contracts. DPL has firm deliverability of swing and seasonal storage; a liquefied natural gas facility and
firm transportation capacity to meet customer demand and provide a reserve margin. The commodity portion of the GCR includes a commission approved hedging program which is intended to reduce gas commodity price volatility while limiting the firm
natural gas customers  exposure to adverse changes in the market price of natural gas. The hedge program requires that DPL hedge, on a non-discretionary basis, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of estimated purchase requirements for each
month, including estimated monthly purchases for storage injections. The fifty percent (50%) hedge monthly target is achieved by hedging 1/12th of the 50% target each month beginning 12-months prior to the month in which the physical gas is to be
purchased. Currently, DPL uses only exchange traded futures for its Gas Hedging Program, which are considered derivatives, however, it retains the capability to employ other physical and financial hedges if needed. DPL has not elected hedge
accounting for these derivative financial instruments. Because of the DPSC-approved fuel adjustment clause for DPL s derivatives, the change in fair value of the derivatives each period, in addition to all premiums paid and other transaction
costs incurred as part of the Gas Hedging Program, are fully recoverable and are recorded by DPL as regulatory assets or liabilities. DPL s physical gas purchases are currently all daily, monthly or intra-month transactions. From time to time,
DPL will enter into seasonal purchase or sale arrangements, however, there are none currently in the portfolio. Certain of DPL s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current
derivative authoritative guidance. Other DPL full requirements contracts are not derivatives.      ACE has
contracts to procure BGS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. The BGS rates charged recover ACE s wholesale power supply costs. ACE

does not make any profit or incur any loss on the supply component of the BGS it supplies to customers. ACE s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. ACE locks in fixed
prices for all of its BGS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of ACE s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance.
Other ACE full requirements contracts are not derivatives.       Proprietary
Trading.     Generation also enters into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in
market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading activities, which included settled physical
sales volumes of 1,506 GWhs and 4,015 GWhs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 1,913 GWhs and 5,378 GWhs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, are a complement to
Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s revenue from energy marketing activities. ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes.
       Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and PHI)     
  The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants
utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in
anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to manage interest rate risks. At September 30, 2016, Exelon had $800 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges
outstanding, and Exelon and Generation had $672 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges outstanding. Assuming the fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates
associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in an approximately $5 million decrease in Exelon Consolidated pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. To manage
foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. Below is a summary of the
interest rate and foreign exchange hedge balances as of September 30, 2016.

    Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity
positions. The characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the proprietary trading activity in the above table is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the
interest rate exposure. Generation does not utilize proprietary trading interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or changes in market interest rates.      

(b)  
    Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include
unrealized derivative transactions with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures, subject to a master netting or
similar agreement, such as accrued interest, transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, letters of credit and other forms of non-cash collateral. These are not reflected in the table above.

    Fair Value Hedges .    For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. Exelon includes the
gain or loss on the hedged items and the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps in interest expense as follows:       

(a)  
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the loss on Generation swaps included $1 million realized in earnings with an immaterial amount
excluded from hedge effectiveness testing.         At September 30, 2016, Exelon had total
outstanding fixed-to-floating fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps of $800 million, with a derivative asset of $39 million. At December 31, 2015, Exelon had total outstanding fixed-to-floating fair value hedges related to interest
rate swaps of $800 million, with a derivative asset of $25 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from fair value hedges was a $6 million and a
$12 million gain, respectively.       Cash Flow Hedges .    During the second quarter of
2016, Exelon entered into $90 million of floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swaps to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with an anticipated debt issuance. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon
terminated the swaps during the third quarter of 2016 upon issuance of the debt. Exelon did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of the termination.      During the first and second quarter of 2016, Exelon entered into $600 million and $100 million of floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swaps, respectively, to manage a portion of the interest
rate exposure associated with the anticipated issuance of debt. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon terminated the swaps during the second quarter of 2016 upon issuance of the debt. Exelon recognized a loss of $3 million related to
the swaps and $3 million of AOCI will be amortized into Other, net in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the term of the debt. See Note 10   Debt and Credit Agreements for additional
information.      During the first quarter of 2016, Exelon entered into $100 million of floating-to-fixed forward
starting interest rate swap to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with an anticipated debt issuance. The swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Exelon terminated the swap during the first quarter of 2016 upon issuance of
the debt. Exelon did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of the termination of the swap and an immaterial amount of AOCI will be amortized into Other, net in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the
term of the debt.      During the third quarter of 2014, ExGen Texas Power, LLC, a subsidiary of Generation,
entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the long-term borrowing. See Note 14   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional

information regarding the financing. The swaps have a notional amount of $496 million as of September 30, 2016 and expire in 2019. The swap was designated as a cash flow hedge in the
fourth quarter of 2014. At September 30, 2016, the subsidiary had a $15 million derivative liability related to the swap.      During the first quarter of 2014, ExGen Renewables I, LLC, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection
with the long-term borrowings. See Note 14   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the financing. The swaps have a notional amount of $176 million as of September 30, 2016
and expire in 2020. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2016, the subsidiary had a $3 million derivative liability related to the swaps.   
  During the second quarter of 2002, PHI entered into treasury rate lock transactions in anticipation of the issuance of
several series of fixed-rate debt commencing in August 2002 to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure. Upon issuance of the fixed-rate debt in August 2002, the treasury rate locks were terminated at a loss and the loss was deferred in
AOCI. As a result of the PHI Merger, the remaining unamortized deferred loss recorded in AOCI was adjusted to zero through application of purchase accounting.   
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the impact on the results of operations as a
result of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges in continuing designated hedge relationships was immaterial.   
   Economic Hedges .    During the third quarter of 2011, Sacramento PV Energy, a subsidiary of
Generation entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the long-term borrowings. See Note 14   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding the financing. During the first quarter of 2016, upon the issuance of debt, Generation terminated the swaps. The total notional amount of the swaps were $25 million. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the
termination of the swaps.      During the third quarter of 2012, Constellation Solar Horizons, a subsidiary of
Generation, entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the long-term borrowings. See Note 14   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding the financing. During the first quarter of 2016, upon the issuance of debt, Generation terminated the swap. The total notional amount of the swap was $24 million. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the
termination of the swap.      During the second quarter 2015, upon the issuance of debt, Exelon terminated $2,400
million of floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination of the swaps, Exelon realized a $64 million loss during the second quarter of 2015.  
  At September 30, 2016, Generation had no notional amounts of interest rate derivative contracts to economically
hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions and $85 million in notional amounts of foreign currency exchange rate swaps that are marked-to-market to manage the exposure associated with international commodity
transactions in currencies other than U.S. dollars.        Fair Value Measurement and Accounting for the Offsetting of Amounts

net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that may have derivative and non-derivative contracts with each other
providing for the net settlement of all referencing contracts via one payment stream, which takes place as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of default. Generation s use of cash collateral is generally
unrestricted, unless Generation is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1). In the table below, Generation s energy related economic hedges and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair
value balances with the same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, including initial margin on exchange positions, is aggregated in the collateral and netting column.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $5 million and $3 million of cash collateral held and posted, respectively, was not offset against derivative positions because such collateral was not associated with any energy-related
derivatives, were associated with accrual positions, or as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. Excluded from the tables below are economic hedges that qualify for the NPNS scope exception and other non-derivative contracts
that are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting.      ComEd s use of cash collateral is
generally unrestricted unless ComEd is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1).      Cash
collateral held by PECO and BGE must be deposited in a non affiliate major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meet certain qualifications.   
  In the table below, DPL s economic hedges are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the
same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, is aggregated in the collateral and netting column.

  The effect of Exelon s and Generation s former energy-related cash flow hedge activity on pre-tax earnings
based on the reclassification adjustment from AOCI to earnings was a $2 million pre-tax gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were no gains recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Neither Exelon nor
Generation will incur changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness in future periods relating to energy-related hedges positions as all were de-designated prior to the Constellation merger date.   
   Economic Hedges (Exelon and Generation).       These instruments represent hedges that
economically mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and include financial options, futures, swaps, physical forward sales and purchases, but for which the fair value or cash flow hedge elections were not made. Additionally, Generation
enters into interest rate derivative contracts and foreign exchange currency swaps ( treasury ) to manage the exposure related to the interest rate component of commodity positions and international purchases of commodities in currencies
other than U.S. Dollars. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the following net pre-tax mark-to-market gains (losses) of certain purchase and sale contracts were reported in Operating revenues or Purchased power and
fuel expense, or Interest expense at Exelon and Generation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in  Net fair value changes related to derivatives  in Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the tables below,  Change in fair value  represents the change in fair value of the derivative contracts held at the reporting date. The  Reclassification to realized at settlement 
represents the recognized change in fair value that was reclassified to realized due to settlement of the derivative during the period.

Credit Risk (All Registrants)     
  The Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter
into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. For energy-related derivative instruments, Generation enters into enabling agreements
that allow for payment netting with its counterparties, which reduces Generation s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically,
each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited to transactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty
that allow for cross product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, Generation s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are
defined in the derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings by
credit rating agencies and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with Generation as specified in each enabling agreement.
Generation s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.

   The following tables provide information on Generation s credit
exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of September 30, 2016. The tables further delineate that exposure by
credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The figures in the tables below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail counterparties, Nuclear fuel procurement
contracts and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE and Nodal commodity exchanges, further discussed in ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Additionally, the figures in the tables below exclude
exposures with affiliates, including net receivables with ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE of $24 million, $45 million, $22 million, $47 million, $12 million, and $10 million as of September 30, 2016, respectively.   

(a)  
    As of September 30, 2016, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $10 million of cash and $22
million of letters of credit. The credit collateral does not include non-liquid collateral.      
  ComEd s power procurement contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position
is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy
exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after adjusting for any unpaid deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the contract. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers
represents ComEd s net credit exposure. As of September 30, 2016, ComEd s net credit exposure to suppliers was approximately $1 million.      ComEd is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs
through customer rates. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.      PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its
credit requirements

with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the
supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the
forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers
represents PECO s net credit exposure. As of September 30, 2016, PECO had no net credit exposure to suppliers.      PECO is permitted to recover its costs of procuring electric supply through its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. PECO s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy
costs through customer rates. See Note 5   Regulatory Matters for additional information.   
  PECO s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved annually on a prospective basis by the PAPUC.
PECO s counterparty credit risk under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the PGC, which allows PECO to adjust rates quarterly to reflect realized natural
gas prices. PECO does not obtain collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements. As of September 30, 2016, PECO had no material credit exposure under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements
with investment grade suppliers.      BGE is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the
MDPSC-approved procurement tariffs. BGE s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional
information.      BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its
electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit
is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is
the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post
collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents BGE s net credit exposure. The seller s credit exposure is calculated each
business day. As of September 30, 2016, BGE had no net credit exposure to suppliers.      BGE s
regulated gas business is exposed to market-price risk. This market-price risk is mitigated by BGE s recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make off-system sales after
BGE has satisfied its customers  demands, which are not covered by the gas cost adjustment clause. At September 30, 2016, BGE had credit exposure of less than $1 million related to off-system sales which is mitigated by parental
guarantees, letters of credit or right to offset clauses within other contracts with those third-party suppliers.      Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s power procurement contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s
lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to
the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s
unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s net credit exposure. As of September 30, 2016, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s net credit exposures to suppliers were
immaterial.

   Pepco is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the
MDPSC-approved and DCPSC-approved procurement tariffs. DPL is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the MDPSC-approved and DPSC-approved procurement tariffs. ACE is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the
NJBPU-approved procurement tariffs. Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s counterparty credit risks are mitigated by their ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 6   Regulatory Matters of the PHI
2015 Form 10-K for additional information.      DPL s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved
annually on a prospective basis by the DPSC. DPL s counterparty credit risk under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the GCR, which allows DPL to adjust
rates annually to reflect realized natural gas prices. To the extent that the fair value of the transactions in a net loss position exceeds the unsecured credit threshold, then collateral is required to be posted in an amount equal to the amount by
which the unsecured credit threshold is exceeded. Exchange-traded contracts are required to be fully collateralized without regard to the credit rating of the holder. As of September 30, 2016, DPL had no credit exposure under its natural gas
supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers.        Collateral and Contingent-Related Features (All
Registrants)        As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or
financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, fuels, emissions allowances and other energy-related products. Certain of Generation s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Generation to
post collateral. Generation also enters into commodity transactions on exchanges (i.e. NYMEX, ICE). The exchanges act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining
requirements. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by
contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk-related contingent features stipulate that if Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide
additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements.
In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes
an amount of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.   
  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability
position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:       

(a)  
    Amount represents the gross fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features ignoring the
effects of master netting agreements.      
         139

Table of Contents  

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

(b)  
    Amount represents the offsetting fair value of in-the-money derivative contracts under legally enforceable master netting agreements with the same
counterparty, which reduces the amount of any liability for which a Registrant could potentially be required to post collateral.      

(c)  
    Amount represents the net fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features after considering
the mitigating effects of offsetting positions under master netting arrangements and reflects the actual net liability upon which any potential contingent collateral obligations would be based.      
  Generation had cash collateral posted of $501 million and letters of credit posted of $420 million and cash collateral
held of $18 million and letters of credit held of $22 million as of September 30, 2016 for external counterparties with derivative positions. Generation had cash collateral posted of $1,267 million and letters of credit posted of $497 million
and cash collateral held of $21 million and letters of credit held of $78 million at December 31, 2015 for external counterparties with derivative positions. In the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ by S P or
Ba1 by Moody s), Generation would have been required to post additional collateral of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These amounts represent the potential additional
collateral required after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and non-derivative positions under master netting agreements.      Generation s and Exelon s interest rate swaps contain provisions that, in the event of a merger, if Generation s debt ratings were to materially weaken, it would be in violation of these
provisions, resulting in the ability of the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to maturity. Collateralization would not be required under any circumstance. Termination of the agreement could result in a settlement payment by Exelon or the
counterparty on any interest rate swap in a net liability position. The settlement amount would be equal to the fair value of the swap on the termination date. As of September 30, 2016, Generation s swaps were in a liability position with
a fair value of $4 million and Exelon s swaps were in an asset position, with a fair value of $35 million.   
  See Note 25   Segment Information of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further information regarding the
letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.      Generation entered into supply forward contracts with
certain utilities, including PECO and BGE, with one-sided collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market
prices rise above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded. Under the terms of ComEd s standard block energy contracts,
collateral postings are one-sided from suppliers, including Generation, should exposures between market prices and benchmark prices exceed established unsecured credit limits outlined in the contracts. As of September 30, 2016, ComEd held $3
million in collateral from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts. Under the terms of ComEd s annual renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required to cover a fixed value for RECs only. In addition, under the
terms of ComEd s long-term renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required from suppliers for both RECs and energy. The REC portion is a fixed value and the energy portion is one-sided from suppliers should the forward market
prices exceed contract prices. As of September 30, 2016, ComEd held approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of credit as margin for both the annual and long-term REC obligations. If ComEd lost its investment grade credit
rating as of September 30, 2016, it would have been required to post approximately $17 million of collateral to its counterparties. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.
     PECO s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO to post collateral.

     Commercial Paper     
  The Registrants had the following amounts of commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:       
      Short-Term Loan Agreements     
  On July 30, 2015, PHI entered into a $300 million term loan agreement. The net proceeds of the loan were used to repay
PHI s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the loan agreement, loans made thereunder bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.95%, and all indebtedness thereunder is unsecured. On April 4,
2016, PHI repaid $300 million of its term loan in full.      On January 13, 2016, PHI entered into a $500 million
term loan agreement, which was amended on March 28, 2016. The net proceeds of the loan were used to repay PHI s outstanding commercial paper, and for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the loan agreement, as amended, loans made
thereunder bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1%, and all indebtedness thereunder is unsecured, and the aggregate principal amount of all loans, together with any accrued but unpaid interest due under the loan agreement, must
be repaid in full on or before March 27, 2017. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon s and PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings.   
  On February 22, 2016, Generation and EDF entered into separate member revolving promissory notes with CENG to finance
short-term working capital needs. The notes are scheduled to mature on January 31, 2017 and bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. On July 25, 2016, CENG paid off the outstanding balances under each note.   
    Credit Agreements        On January 5, 2016, Generation entered into a credit agreement establishing a $150 million bilateral credit facility, scheduled to mature in January of 2019. This facility will solely be utilized by
Generation to issue letters of credit. This facility does not back Generation s commercial paper program.   
  On April 1, 2016, the credit agreement for CENG s $100 million bilateral credit facility was amended to increase the
overall facility size to $200 million. This facility is utilized by CENG to fund working capital and capital projects. The facility does not back Generation s commercial paper program.   
  On May 26, 2016, Exelon Corporate, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE entered into amendments to each of their respective
syndicated revolving credit facilities, which extended the maturity of each of the facilities to May 26, 2021. Exelon Corporate also increased the size of its facility from $500 million to $600 million. On May 26, 2016, PHI, Pepco,
DPL and ACE entered into an amendment to their Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 1, 2011, which (i) extended the maturity date of the facility to May 26, 2021, (ii) removed PHI as a borrower under the facility, (iii)
decreased the size of the facility from $1.5 billion to $900 million and (iv) aligned its financial covenant from debt to capitalization leverage ratio to interest coverage ratio.

(a)  
    Includes restricted proceeds of $30 million shown in the Restricted proceeds from issuance of long-term debt on Exelon s and PECO s Cash
Flow Statements and Restricted cash and cash equivalents on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted proceeds were used as a portion of the payment on the maturing mortgage bonds due October 15, 2016, and as of that
date, the restriction is no longer in place.           CEU Upstream Nonrecourse Debt     
  In July 2011, CEU Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into a 5-year reserve based lending
agreement (RBL) associated with certain Upstream oil and gas properties that it owns. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of default pursuant to the RBL. Borrowings under this arrangement are secured by
the assets and equity of CEU Holdings. The commitment level can be decreased if the assets no longer support the current borrowing base, which may result in repayment of a portion or all of the outstanding balance, or potential foreclosure of the
assets. The commitment can be increased up to $500 million if the assets support a higher borrowing base and CEU Holdings is able to obtain additional commitments from lenders. Calculations of the borrowing base are impacted by projected production
and commodity prices. The facility was amended and extended on January 14, 2014 through January 2019. As of December 31, 2015, $68 million was outstanding under the facility with interest payable monthly at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus
2.50% and the borrowing base committed under the facility was $85 million. The outstanding balance was classified as Long-term debt on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

   In February 2016, as part of their semi-annual borrowing base
re-determination testing, the RBL lenders notified CEU Holdings that the RBL borrowing base was decreased to $45 million, resulting in a  borrowing base deficiency  under the RBL of $23 million. Given the decline in value of the Upstream
assets resulting from lower commodity prices, CEU Holdings chose not to provide the lenders with a formal plan for curing the borrowing base deficiency by March 31, 2016, as was required by the RBL. The lenders have sent CEU Holdings a
notice of event of default and demand for cure. On March 31, 2016, $7 million of the debt was repaid using CEU Holding s cash, resulting in an outstanding debt balance of $61 million with interest payable monthly at a variable rate equal to
LIBOR plus 2.75% and a borrowing base deficiency under the RBL of $16 million. At March 31, 2016, the outstanding debt balance of $61 million was classified within Long-term debt due within one year on Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.      On June 16, 2016, CEU Holdings executed a forbearance agreement with the lenders
which included terms stipulating roles and responsibilities governing a sales process, approval of the sale of the assets to be at the discretion of the lenders, and a sales timetable, with ultimate execution of the sales agreement expected to occur
by December 31, 2016. Upon disposition of the assets and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, CEU Holdings will be released of its obligations regardless of the amount of asset sale proceeds received. The ultimate resolution of this
matter has no direct effect on any Exelon or Generation credit facilities or other debt of an Exelon entity. See Note 14   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K, Note 5   Mergers, Acquisitions and
Dispositions and Note 6   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.       

11.    Income   
     Taxes (All Registrants)          The effective income tax rate from continuing operations varies from the U.S. Federal statutory rate principally due to the following:

(a)  
    DPL and ACE recognized a loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and PHI recognized a loss before income taxes
for the period of March 24, 2016, through September 30, 2016. As a result, positive percentages represent an income tax benefit for the periods presented.      

(b)  
    Includes a remeasurement of uncertain state income tax positions for Pepco and DPL.      

(c)  
    At PECO, includes a cumulative adjustment related to an anticipated gas repairs tax return accounting method change.      
   Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes    
  The Registrants have the following unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:
      
    Exelon and ComEd s unrecognized tax benefits changed by $328 million and $154
million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 as a result of the lease termination on the like-kind exchange position discussed below. In addition, as a result of the merger, an assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state
uncertain income tax positions resulted in an increase in unrecognized tax benefits at Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE of $164 million, $135 million, $71 million, $31 million and $22 million, respectively.

     Reasonably possible the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could
significantly increase or decrease within 12 months after the reporting date         Settlement of Income Tax Audits and
Litigation       As of September 30, 2016, Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL have approximately
$251 million, $52 million, $120 million, $79 million, $59 million, and $20 million of unrecognized federal and state tax benefits that could significantly decrease within the 12 months after the reporting date as a result of completing audits and
potential settlements. Of the above unrecognized tax benefits, Exelon and Generation have $52 million that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits related to BGE, DPL, and a portion of Pepco, if
recognized, may be included in future regulated base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.   
   Other Income Tax Matters         Like-Kind Exchange (Exelon and ComEd)        Exelon,
through its ComEd subsidiary, took a position on its 1999 income tax return to defer approximately $1.2 billion of tax gain on the sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets. The gain was deferred by reinvesting a portion of the proceeds
from the sale in qualifying replacement property under the like-kind exchange provisions of the IRC. The like-kind exchange replacement property purchased by Exelon included interests in three municipal-owned electric generation facilities which
were properly leased back to the municipalities.      The IRS disagreed with this position and asserted that the
entire gain of approximately $1.2 billion was taxable in 1999. Exelon was unable to reach agreement with the IRS regarding the dispute over the like-kind exchange position. The IRS asserted that the Exelon purchase and leaseback transaction was
substantially similar to a leasing transaction, known as a SILO, which the IRS does not respect as the acquisition of an ownership interest in property. A SILO is a  listed transaction  that the IRS has identified as a potentially abusive
tax shelter under guidance issued in 2005. Accordingly, the IRS asserted that the sale of the fossil plants followed by the purchase and leaseback of the municipal owned generation facilities did not qualify as a like-kind exchange and the gain on
the sale is fully subject to tax. The IRS also asserted a penalty of approximately $90 million for a substantial understatement of tax.      In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Exelon was required to assess whether it was  more-likely-than-not  that to prevail in litigation. In light of the
outcome of another case involving a listed transaction and Exelon s determination that settlement was unlikely, Exelon concluded that subsequent to December 31, 2012, it was no longer more-likely-than-not that its position would be sustained.
As a result, in the first quarter of 2013 Exelon recorded a non-cash charge to earnings of approximately $265 million, which represented the amount of interest expense (after-tax) and incremental state income tax expense for periods through March
31, 2013, that would be payable in the event that Exelon is unsuccessful in litigation. Of this amount, approximately $172 million was recorded at ComEd. Exelon has agreed to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts on ComEd s equity of
the after-tax interest or penalty amounts. As a result, ComEd recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, a $172 million receivable and non-cash equity contributions from Exelon. Based on applicable case law and the facts of the
transaction, Exelon did not believe it was likely a penalty would be assessed. Accordingly, no charge was recorded for the penalty asserted nor for after-tax interest that could be due on the asserted penalty.   
  On September 30, 2013, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency to Exelon for the like-kind exchange position. Exelon filed
a petition on December 13, 2013 to initiate litigation in the United States Tax Court and the trial took place in August of 2015. Exelon was not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the issue.   
         149

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    
   
   On September 19, 2016, the Tax Court rejected Exelon s position in
the case and ruled that Exelon was not entitled to defer gain on the transaction. In addition, contrary to Exelon s evaluation that the penalty was unwarranted, the Tax Court ruled that Exelon is liable for the penalty and interest due on the
asserted penalty. In early 2017, Exelon expects to timely appeal this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.      While it has strong arguments on appeal with respect to both the merits and the penalty, Exelon has determined that, pursuant to accounting standards, it is no longer more-likely-than-not to avoid the
penalty. As a result, in the third quarter of 2016, Exelon recorded a charge to earnings for the penalty and the after-tax interest due on the asserted penalty of approximately $200 million, of which approximately $150 million was recorded at ComEd.
Exelon and ComEd recorded the penalty and interest due on the asserted penalty to Other, net and Interest expense, net, respectively, on their Consolidated Statements of Operations. Consistent with Exelon s agreement to continue to hold ComEd
harmless from any unfavorable impact on its equity, ComEd recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, a $150 million receivable and non-cash equity contributions from Exelon.  
  In order to appeal the decision, Exelon is required to pay the tax, penalties and interest at the time Exelon files its
appeal (expected early 2017). While the final calculation of tax, penalties and interest has not yet been finalized by the IRS, Exelon estimates that a payment of approximately $1.4 billion related to the like-kind exchange will be due,
including $300 million from ComEd, in the first quarter of 2017. While Exelon will receive a tax benefit of $400 million associated with the deduction for the interest, Exelon currently has a net operating loss carryforward and thus does not expect
to realize the cash benefit until 2018. After taking into account these interest deduction tax benefits, the total estimated net cash outflow for the like-kind exchange is $1 billion, of which approximately $300 million is attributable to ComEd
after giving consideration to Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of after-tax interest or penalty amounts on ComEd s equity. Upon a final appellate decision, which could take up to several years, Exelon
expects to receive $80 million related to final interest computations.      As of September 30, 2016, ComEd
has a total receivable from Exelon pursuant to the hold harmless agreement of $345 million, which is included in Current Receivables from Affiliates on ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under the agreement, Exelon will settle this receivable
with ComEd no later than the time that the payments related to the like-kind exchange are due to the IRS, currently anticipated in first quarter 2017. Exelon will not seek recovery from ComEd customers for any interest or penalty amounts
associated with the like-kind exchange tax position.     As previously disclosed, in the first quarter of 2014,
Exelon entered into an agreement to terminate its investment in one of the three municipal-owned electric generation properties in exchange for a net early termination amount of $335 million. On March 31, 2016, Exelon entered into an agreement to
terminate its interests in the remaining two municipal-owned electric generation properties in exchange for $360 million.   
   Long-Term State Tax Apportionment (Exelon, Generation and PHI)    
  Exelon, Generation and PHI periodically review events that may significantly impact how income is apportioned among the
states and, therefore, the calculation of their respective deferred state income taxes. Events that may require Exelon, Generation and PHI to update their long-term state tax apportionment include significant changes in tax law and/or significant
operational changes, such as the merger with PHI. As a result of the merger, Exelon and Generation reevaluated their long-term state tax apportionment for all states where they have state income tax obligations, which include Delaware, Illinois,
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C., as well as other states. The total effect of revising the long-term state tax apportionment

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

resulted in the recording of deferred state tax benefit in the amount of $1 million and a state tax expense of $6 million, net of tax, for Exelon and Generation, respectively. Further,
Exelon and PHI recorded deferred state tax liabilities of $59 million and $8 million, net of tax, respectively, as part of purchase accounting during the first quarter of 2016.   

12.    Nuclear   
     Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation)            Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations     
  Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating
licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis,
considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. Generation updates its ARO annually,
unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios.   
  The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected on Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016:      

(a)  
    Includes $44 million and $7 million for the current portion of the ARO at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is
included in Other current liabilities on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.         During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Generation s nuclear ARO increased by approximately $763 million, reflecting impacts of ARO updates completed during the first and second
quarters of 2016 to reflect changes in amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows and impacts of year-to-date accretion of the ARO liability due to the passage of time.   
  In 2016, the ARO liability increased by $444 million primarily driven by an increase of $384 million associated with the
June 2, 2016 announcement to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear units on June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, respectively, as well as an increase of $60 million primarily due to an increase in the estimated costs to decommission the
Oyster Creek nuclear unit as a result of the completion of an updated decommissioning cost study. Refer to Note 7   Early Nuclear Plant Retirements for additional information regarding the announced early retirements of Clinton and
Quad Cities. The increase in the ARO liability for Clinton and Quad Cities incorporates the early shutdown dates (including fleet-wide impacts of spent nuclear fuel removal and storage costs), increases in the assumed probabilities of longer term
decommissioning scenarios, and reflects an increase in the estimated costs to decommission based on updated decommissioning cost studies reflecting the early retirement of these units.   
  The financial statement impact related to the increase in the ARO liability due to the changes in, and timing of,
estimated cash flows resulted in a corresponding increase in Property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The majority of the increase in cost will be amortized over the remaining useful lives of
the Clinton, Quad Cities and Oyster Creek nuclear plants, which are set to retire in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

     Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Exelon and Generation had NDT fund investments totaling $11,076
million and $10,342 million, respectively.      The following table provides unrealized gains on NDT funds for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       

(a)  
    Net unrealized gains related to Generation s NDT funds associated with Regulatory Agreement Units are included in Regulatory liabilities on
Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Noncurrent payables to affiliates on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.      

(b)  
    Excludes $(5) million of net unrealized gain related to the Zion Station pledged assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Excludes
$(2) million and $9 million of net unrealized gain related to the Zion Station pledged assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net unrealized gains related to Zion Station pledged assets are included in the
Payable for Zion Station decommissioning on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.      

(c)  
    Net unrealized gains related to Generation s NDT funds with Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are included within Other, net in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.         Interest
and dividends on NDT fund investments are recognized when earned and are included in Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest and dividends earned on the NDT fund
investments for the Regulatory Agreement Units are eliminated within Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

related decommissioning obligations.        Zion Station Decommissioning     
  On September 1, 2010, Generation completed an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions Inc. and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, under which ZionSolutions has assumed responsibility for completing certain decommissioning activities at Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased
operation in 1998. See Note 16   Asset Retirement Obligations of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for information regarding the specific treatment of assets, including NDT funds, and decommissioning liabilities transferred in the
transaction.      ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursements from
the Zion Station NDT funds as defined within the ASA. Therefore, the transfer of the Zion Station assets did not qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and, as a result, the related NDT funds were reclassified to Pledged assets for Zion

Station decommissioning within Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to be measured in the same manner as prior to the completion of the transaction.
Additionally, the transferred ARO for decommissioning was replaced with a Payable for Zion Station decommissioning in Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the value of the Zion Station NDT assets, net of
applicable taxes, are recorded as a change in the Payable to ZionSolutions. At no point will the payable to ZionSolutions exceed the project budget of the costs remaining to decommission Zion Station. Generation has retained its obligation for the
SNF. Following ZionSolutions  completion of its contractual obligations and transfer of the NRC license to Generation, Generation will store the SNF at Zion Station until it is transferred to the DOE for ultimate disposal, and will
complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF dry storage facility. Generation has a liability of approximately $87 million which is included within the nuclear decommissioning ARO at September 30,
2016. Generation also has retained NDT assets to fund its obligation to maintain the SNF at Zion Station until transfer to the DOE and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities for the SNF storage facility. Any shortage of funds
necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by Generation. Any Zion Station NDT funds remaining after the completion of all decommissioning activities will be returned to ComEd
customers in accordance with the applicable orders. The following table provides the pledged assets and payables to ZionSolutions, and withdrawals by ZionSolutions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

(a)  
    Excludes a liability recorded within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the tax obligation on the unrealized
activity associated with the Zion Station NDT funds. The NDT funds will be utilized to satisfy the tax obligations as gains and losses are realized.      

(b)  
    Included in Other current liabilities within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.      

(c)  
    Includes project expenses to decommission Zion Station and estimated tax payments on Zion Station NDT fund earnings.      
    NRC Minimum Funding Requirements        NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end
of its life.      Generation filed its biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC on March 31,
2015. This report reflects the status of decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2014. Due to increased cost estimates received in the second half of 2014, Braidwood Units 1 and 2, and Byron Unit 2 did not meet the NRC s minimum
funding assurance criteria as of December 31, 2014. NRC guidance provides licensees with two years or by the time of submitting the next biennial report (on or before March 31, 2017) to resolve funding assurance shortfalls. On February 4, 2016,
Generation submitted to the NRC an updated decommissioning funding status report for Braidwood Units 1 and 2, and Byron Unit 2. This updated report reflected the recently approved license renewals for these units, and showed that the shortfall
identified in the March 31, 2015 report has now been resolved and that Generation has provided adequate decommissioning funding assurance for each unit.      On March 31, 2016, Generation submitted its NRC required annual decommissioning funding status report as of December 31, 2015 for reactors that have been shut down or are within five years of shut down
except for

Zion Station which is included in a separate report to the NRC submitted by EnergySolutions (see Zion Station Decommissioning above). As of December 31, 2015, Generation provided adequate
decommissioning funding assurance for all of its reactors that have been shut down or are within five years of shut down except for Peach Bottom Unit 1. As a former PECO plant, financial assurance for decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is
provided by the NDT fund in addition to collections from PECO ratepayers. As discussed in Note 16   Asset Retirement Obligations of Exelon s 2015 Form 10-K, the amount collected from PECO ratepayers will be adjusted in the next
filing to the PAPUC with new rates effective January 1, 2018.      Generation will file its next decommissioning
funding status report with the NRC by March 31, 2017. This report will reflect the status of decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2016 and will reflect the impacts of the announced early retirements of Clinton and Quad Cities. A
shortfall could require Exelon to post parental guarantees for Generation s share of the funding assurance. However, the amount of any required guarantees will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site, the
associated level of costs, and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward.       

13.    Retirement   
     Benefits (All Registrants)          Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for essentially all employees.   
  Effective March 23, 2016, Exelon became the sponsor of all of PHI s defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans, and assumed PHI s benefit plan obligations and related assets. As a result, PHI s benefit plan net obligation and related regulatory assets were transferred to Exelon. The legacy PHI pension and other
postretirement benefit plans were initially remeasured on February 29, 2016 as a result of the short time between the merger close and the end of the first quarter of 2016, using current assumptions, including the discount rate. Exelon updated
these amounts in June 2016 to reflect assumptions at March 31, 2016. The updated valuation resulted in a $25 million reduction in the net obligation.        Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits        During the first quarter of 2016, Exelon received an updated valuation of its legacy pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2016. This
valuation resulted in an increase to the pension obligation of $35 million and a decrease to the other postretirement benefit obligation of $8 million. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $2 million (after
tax), regulatory assets increased by approximately $27 million, and regulatory liabilities increased by approximately $3 million.      The majority of the 2016 pension benefit cost for legacy Exelon-sponsored plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 4.29%. The majority
of the 2016 other postretirement benefit cost is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.71% for funded plans and a discount rate of 4.29%.  
  The 2016 pension benefit costs for the legacy PHI plans are calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets of 6.50% and a discount rate of 3.96% for the majority of the pension plans. The 2016 other postretirement benefit cost is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% and a discount rate of 3.80%.   
  A portion of the net periodic benefit cost for all plans is capitalized within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
following table presents the components of Exelon s net periodic benefit costs, prior to capitalization, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

    Defined Contribution Savings Plans        The Registrants participate in various 401(k) defined contribution savings plans that are sponsored by Exelon. The plans are qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allow employees to
contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The following table presents the matching contributions to
the savings plans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

14.      Severance   
     (All Registrants)          The Registrants have an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer an employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. The Registrants record a liability
and expense or regulatory asset for severance once terminations are probable of occurrence and the related severance benefits can be reasonably estimated. For severance benefits that are incremental to its ongoing severance plan ( one-time
termination benefits ), the Registrants measure the obligation and record the expense at fair value at the communication date if there are no future service requirements, or, if future service is required to receive the termination benefit,
ratably over the required service period.        Ongoing Severance Plans     
  The Registrants provide severance and health and welfare benefits under Exelon s ongoing severance benefit plans to
terminated employees in the normal course of business. These benefits are accrued for when the benefits are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated.   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PHI recorded the
following severance costs (benefits) associated with these ongoing severance benefits within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   

(a)  
    The amounts above for Generation include less than $1 million for amounts billed by BSC through intercompany allocations for both the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $2 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The amounts above for ComEd include $1 million billed by BSC through intercompany allocations for both the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The amounts above for PHI include $1 million billed by BSC through intercompany allocations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.      
    Early Plant Retirement-Related Severance     
  As a result of the Clinton and Quad Cities plant retirement decision, Exelon and Generation will incur certain
employee-related costs, including severance benefit costs. Severance benefits will be provided to

impacted union and non-union employees, to the extent that those employees are not redeployed to other locations. The final amount of severance cost will ultimately depend on the specific
employees severed.      For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Registrants recorded the
following severance costs (benefits) related to the early plant retirements within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, pursuant to the authoritative guidance for ongoing
severance plans:       

(a)  
    The amounts above for Generation include $2 million for amounts billed by BSC through intercompany allocations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.           Cost Management Program-Related Severance     
  In August 2015, Exelon announced a cost management program focused on cost savings at BSC and Generation, including the
elimination of approximately 500 positions. These actions are in response to the continuing economic challenges confronting all parts of Exelon s business and industry, necessitating continued focus on cost management through enhanced
efficiency and productivity. Exelon expects that approximately 250 corporate support positions in BSC and approximately 250 positions located throughout Generation will be eliminated.   
  Upon Senior Management approval of the cost management targets and initiatives in the first quarter of 2016, Exelon
recorded severance benefit costs of $17 million associated with the anticipated position reductions. Additional severance benefit costs recorded in the third quarter were $1 million for Generation and Exelon. The final amount of the charge will
ultimately depend on the specific employees severed.      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Registrants recorded the following severance costs related to the cost management program within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, pursuant to the authoritative guidance for
ongoing severance plans:       

(a)  
    The amounts above for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE include $7 million, $3 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, for amounts billed by
BSC through intercompany allocations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.           Severance
Costs Related to the PHI Merger        Upon closing the PHI Merger, Exelon recorded a severance accrual for
the anticipated employee position reductions as a result of the post-merger integration. Cash payments under the plan began in May 2016 and will continue through 2020.

   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the PHI merger severance
costs were immaterial. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Registrants recorded the following severance costs associated with the identified job reductions within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income, pursuant to the authoritative guidance for ongoing severance plans:       

(a)  
    The amounts above for Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE include amounts billed by BSC and/or PHISCO through intercompany allocations

    As a result of the PHI Merger, the PHI predecessor balances at March 23, 2016 were reduced to zero on March 24, 2016 due to purchase
accounting adjustments applied to PHI.         ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE did not have
any reclassifications out of AOCI to Net income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following tables present amounts reclassified out of AOCI to Net income for Exelon, Generation and PHI during the three and

16.    Mezzanine   
     Equity (Exelon, Generation and PHI)            Contingently Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests (Exelon and Generation)        In November 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an arrangement to sell a portion of its equity to a tax equity investor. Pursuant to the operating
agreement, in certain circumstances the equity contributed by the noncontrolling interests holder could be contingently redeemable. These circumstances are outside of the control of Generation and the noncontrolling interests holder resulting in a
portion of the noncontrolling interests being considered contingently redeemable and thus presented in mezzanine equity on the consolidated balance sheet.

   The following table summarizes the changes in the contingently
redeemable noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:       
      Preferred Stock (PHI)     
  In connection with the PHI Merger Agreement, Exelon purchased 18,000 originally issued shares of PHI preferred stock for a
purchase price of $180 million. PHI excluded the preferred stock from equity at December 31, 2015 since the preferred stock contained conditions for redemption that were not solely within the control of PHI. Management determined that the
preferred stock contained embedded features requiring separate accounting consideration to reflect the potential value to PHI that any issued and outstanding preferred stock could be called and redeemed at a nominal par value upon a termination of
the merger agreement under certain circumstances due to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. The embedded call and redemption features on the shares of the preferred stock in the event of such a termination were separately accounted
for as derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the derivative related to the preferred stock was estimated to be $18 million based on PHI s updated assessment and was included in Current assets with a corresponding increase in
Preferred stock on PHI s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Immediately prior to the merger date, PHI updated its assessment of the fair value of the derivative and reduced the fair value to zero, recording the $18 million decrease in fair value as a
reduction of Other, within PHI s predecessor period, January 1, 2016 to March 23, 2016, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
  On March 23, 2016, the preferred stock was cancelled and the $180 million cash consideration previously received by
PHI to issue the preferred stock was treated as additional merger purchase price consideration.       

17.    Earnings   
     Per Share and Equity (Exelon and BGE)            Earnings per Share (Exelon)        Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by dividing Net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, including shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options, performance share awards and
restricted stock outstanding under Exelon s LTIPs considered to be common stock equivalents. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share and shows the effect of these stock options, performance share
awards and restricted stock on the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share:

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    
   
   The number of stock options not included in the calculation of diluted
common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect was approximately 11 million and 12 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and 14 million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The number of equity units related to the PHI Merger not included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect was less than 1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, and 4 million and 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Refer to Note 19   Shareholder s Equity of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further information regarding the equity units.
     Under share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of
$2.3 billion as of September 30, 2016. In 2008, Exelon management decided to defer indefinitely any share repurchases.   
    Preference Stock Redemption (BGE)        BGE had $190 million of cumulative preference stock that was redeemable at its option at any time after October 1, 2015 for the redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On
July 3, 2016, BGE redeemed all 400,000 shares of its outstanding 7.125% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series and all 600,000 shares of its outstanding 6.99% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1995 Series for $100 million, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. On September 18, 2016, BGE redeemed the remaining 500,000 shares of its outstanding 6.970% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series and the remaining 400,000 shares of its outstanding 6.70% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series for $90
million, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.       

18.    Commitments   
     and Contingencies (   All Registrants   )       
  The following is an update to the current status of commitments and contingencies set forth in Note 23 of the Exelon 2015
Form 10-K and Note 16 of the PHI 2015 Form 10-K. See Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for further discussion on the PHI Merger commitments.       Commitments         Constellation Merger Commitments (Exelon and Generation)
       In February 2012, the MDPSC issued an Order approving the Exelon and Constellation merger. As part of
the MDPSC Order, Exelon agreed to provide a package of benefits to BGE customers, the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the State of Maryland of approximately $1 billion. The direct
investment estimate includes $95 million to $120 million relating to the construction of a headquarters building in Baltimore for Generation s competitive energy businesses.   
  The direct investment commitment also includes $450 million to $550 million relating to Exelon and Generation s
development or assistance in the development of 275   300 MWs of new generation in Maryland, which is expected to be completed over a period of 10 years. As of September 30, 2016, Exelon and Generation have incurred $404 million towards
satisfying the commitment for new generation development in the state of Maryland, with approximately 220 MW of the new generation commencing with commercial operations to date. The MDPSC Order contemplates various options for complying with the new
generation development commitments, including building or acquiring generating assets, making subsidy or compliance payments, or in circumstances in which the generation build is delayed or certain specified provisions are elected, making liquidated
damages payments. Exelon and Generation expect that the majority of these commitments will be satisfied by building or acquiring generating assets and, therefore, will be primarily capital in nature and recognized as incurred. However, during the
third quarter of 2014, the conditions associated with one of the   
         166

Table of Contents  

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

generation development commitments changed such that Exelon and Generation believe that the most likely outcome will involve making subsidy payments and/or liquidated damages payments rather than
constructing the specified generating plant. As a result, Exelon and Generation recorded a pre-tax $44 million loss contingency related to this generation development commitment. While this $44 million loss contingency represents
Generation s best estimate of the future obligation, it is reasonably possible that Exelon and Generation could ultimately be required to make cumulative subsidy payments of up to a maximum of approximately $105 million over a 20-year period
dependent on actual generating output from a successfully constructed generating plant.        Equity Investment Commitments
(Exelon and Generation)        Generation has entered into equity purchase agreements that include
commitments to invest additional equity through incremental payments to fund the anticipated needs of the planned operations of the associated companies. The commitments include approximately $20 million of in-kind services and 100% of 2015 ESA
Investco, LLC s equity commitment since 2015 ESA Investco, LLC is consolidated by Generation (see Note 3  Variable Interest Entities for additional details). As of September 30, 2016, Generation s estimated commitments relating
to its equity purchase agreements, including the in-kind services contributions, is anticipated to be as follows:       

(a)  
    The noncontrolling interests holder of 2015 ESA Investco, LLC will contribute up to $31 million in support of a portion of the remaining equity
commitment.           Commercial Commitments (All Registrants)     
  The Registrants  commercial commitments as of September 30, 2016, representing commitments potentially triggered
by future events were as follows:       

(a)  
    Letters of credit (non-debt)   Exelon and certain subsidiaries maintain non-debt letters of credit to provide credit support for certain
transactions as requested by third parties.      

(b)  
    Surety bonds   Guarantees issued related to contract and commercial agreements, excluding bid bonds.      

(c)  
    Nuclear insurance premiums   Represents the maximum amount that Generation would be required to pay for retrospective premiums in the event of
nuclear disaster at any domestic site, including CENG sites, under the Secondary Financial Protection pool as required under the Price-Anderson Act as well as the current aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation that could be imposed by
NEIL. See the Nuclear Insurance section within this note for additional details on Generation s nuclear insurance premiums.

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

(d)  
    Represents the maximum potential obligation in the event that the fair value of certain leased equipment and fleet vehicles is zero at the end of
the maximum lease term. The maximum lease term associated with these assets ranges from 3 to 8 years. The maximum potential obligation at the end of the minimum lease term would be $50 million, $13 million of which is a guarantee by Pepco, $17
million by DPL and $13 million by ACE. The minimum lease term associated with these assets ranges from 1 to 4 years. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made and PHI believes the likelihood of payments being required under
the guarantees is remote.           Nuclear Insurance (Exelon and Generation)     
  Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear
stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has mitigated its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.   
  The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an
incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and also to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of September 30, 2016, the current liability limit per incident is $13.4 billion and
is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors. An inflation adjustment must be made at least once every 5 years and the last inflation adjustment was made effective September 10,
2013. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for
public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. As of September 30, 2016, the amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $375 million for each operating site. Additionally, the Price-Anderson Act requires a
second layer of protection through the mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power reactors (currently 102 reactors) resulting in an additional $13.0 billion in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this
secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Under the Price-Anderson Act, the maximum assessment
in the event of an incident for each nuclear operator, per reactor, per incident (including a 5% surcharge), is $127.3 million, payable at no more than $19 million per reactor per incident per year. Exelon s maximum liability per incident is
approximately $2.7 billion, including CENG s related liability.      In addition, the U.S. Congress could
impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $13.4 billion limit for a single incident.      As part of the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that
may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this indemnity. See Note 5  Investment in
Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on Generation s operations relating to CENG.      Generation is required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates Generation possesses sufficient financial resources to stabilize and
decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company of which
Generation is a member.      NEIL provides  all risk  property damage, decontamination and premature
decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will be
allocated to a fund,   
         168

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)
       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

which Generation is required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability
of insurance proceeds to Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage
under one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery for all losses by all insureds will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and
any other source, applicable to such losses.      For its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent
that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by Generation. Any such losses
could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.       Environmental Issues    (All Registrants)       
    General.      The Registrants  operations have in the past, and may in the future,
require substantial expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or
formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in
contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to
additional proceedings in the future.      ComEd, PECO, BGE and DPL have identified sites where former MGP
activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For almost all of these sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location.   

ComEd has identified 42 sites, 17 of which the remediation has been completed and approved by the Illinois EPA or the U.S. EPA and 25 that are
currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2021.      

PECO has identified 26 sites, 16 of which have been remediated in accordance with applicable PA DEP regulatory requirements. The remaining 10
sites are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2022.      

BGE has identified 13 former gas manufacturing or purification sites that it currently owns or owned at one time through a predecessor s
acquisition. Two gas manufacturing sites require some level of remediation and ongoing monitoring under the direction of the MDE. The required costs at these two sites are not considered material. One former gas purification site is currently
under investigation at the direction of the MDE. For more information, see the discussion of the Riverside site below.          

DPL has identified 2 sites, all of which the remediation has been completed and approved by the MDE or the Delaware Department of Natural Resources
and Environmental Control.         ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to
settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, are currently recovering environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. ComEd and PECO have recorded regulatory assets for the recovery of these
costs. See Note 5  Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the associated regulatory assets. BGE is authorized to recover, and is currently recovering, environmental costs for the remediation of the former MGP facility sites
  
         169

from customers; however, while BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates. DPL has historically
received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates.      As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities within their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:

(a)  
    For BGE, includes reserve for Riverside, a gas purification site. See discussion below for additional information.      
  The historical nature of the MGP sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the
ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using all available
information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any
significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency.   
  During the third quarter of 2016, ComEd and PECO completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation
requirements. The results of the study resulted in a $7 million and $2 million increase to environmental liabilities and related regulatory assets for ComEd and PECO, respectively.   
  The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur other significant liabilities for additional
investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers.

     Water Quality     
    Groundwater Contamination.      In October 2007, a subsidiary of Constellation entered
into a consent decree with the MDE relating to groundwater contamination at a third-party facility that was licensed to accept fly ash, a byproduct generated by coal-fired plants. The consent decree required the payment of a $1 million penalty,
remediation of groundwater contamination resulting from the ash placement operations at the site, replacement of drinking water supplies in the vicinity of the site, and monitoring of groundwater conditions. Generation s remaining groundwater
contamination reserve was approximately $13 million at September 30, 2016 and $12 million at December 31, 2015.        Benning Road Site NPDES Permit Limit Exceedances  .    Pepco holds an NPDES permit issued by EPA with a July 19, 2009 effective date, which authorizes discharges from the
Benning Road site, including the Pepco Energy Services generating facility previously located on the site that was deactivated in 2012 and subsequently demolished. The 2009 permit for the first time imposed numerical limits on the allowable
concentration of certain metals in storm water discharged from the site into the Anacostia River as determined by EPA to be necessary to meet the applicable District of Columbia surface water quality standards. The permit contemplated that Pepco
would meet these limits over time through the use of best management practices (BMPs). As of December 2012, Pepco completed the implementation of the first two phases of BMPs identified in a plan approved by EPA (consisting principally of installing
metal absorbing filters to capture contaminants at storm water inlets, removing stored equipment from areas exposed to the weather, covering and painting exposed metal pipes, and covering and cleaning dumpsters). These measures were effective in
reducing metal concentrations in storm water discharges, but were not sufficient to meet all of the numerical limits for metals. Most of the quarterly monitoring results since the issuance of the permit have shown exceedances of the limits for
copper and zinc, as well as occasional exceedances for iron and lead.      The NPDES permit was due to expire on
June 19, 2014. Pepco submitted a permit renewal application on December 17, 2013. In November 2014, EPA advised Pepco that it will not renew the permit until the Benning Road site has come into compliance with the existing permit limits. The current
permit remains in effect pending EPA s action on the renewal application. In December 2014, Pepco submitted a plan to EPA to implement the third phase of BMPs recommended in the original permit compliance plan with the objective of achieving
full compliance with the permit limits for metals by the end of 2015 and Pepco immediately began to implement the additional BMPs in accordance with the plan. On September 1, 2015, Pepco submitted a report to EPA on the status of implementation of
the third phase of BMPs. As of that date, Pepco had fully implemented most of the elements of the Phase 3 plan, including installation of upgraded storm water inlet controls (filters and booms), enhanced inspection and maintenance of inlets, removal
of materials and equipment from exposure to storm water, and removal of accumulated sediments from the underground storm drains. The sampling results from the third quarter of 2015 showed compliance with all of the permit limits. However, more
recent sampling results continued to show modest exceedances for copper and zinc. As confirmed by this latest sampling, because the permit limits are low and site conditions are subject to variation, Pepco has concluded that some form of storm water
treatment prior to discharge will be necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with all permit limits and has begun the process of evaluating treatment options. The nature and scope of the necessary treatment system, and the amount of the associated
capital expenditures, will not be known until Pepco has completed the evaluation and design process.      Pepco
has been engaged in discussions with representatives from EPA and the DOJ regarding permit compliance. On October 30, 2015, EPA filed a Clean Water Act civil enforcement action against Pepco in federal district court. Pepco expects that this
enforcement action will be resolved through a consent decree that will (i) establish further requirements to achieve compliance with the permit limits, including the design and installation of an appropriate storm water treatment system as
noted above, and (ii) include civil penalties for past noncompliance. Pepco has established what it believes is an appropriate reserve for potential penalties which is   
         171

included in the table above. Pepco does not expect the amount of such penalties above the financial reserve to have a material adverse effect on Exelon s, PHI s and Pepco s
consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.      Pepco and EPA are currently in
discussions regarding the terms of the contemplated consent decree, and it is anticipated that the parties will finalize the consent decree before the end of 2016. In response to a joint motion by the parties, the court has extended the deadline for
Pepco to answer the complaint to November 15, 2016, to give the parties time to work towards agreement on the terms of a consent decree. The parties contemplate seeking a further extension if necessary to complete their negotiations. Once executed
by the parties, the consent decree will be filed with the court for review and approval following a period for public comment.      On March 14, 2016, the court granted a motion by the Anacostia Riverkeeper to intervene in this case as a plaintiff along with EPA. As an intervenor, the Anacostia Riverkeeper will be entitled to file a
brief commenting on the proposed consent decree and to appeal any decision by the court to approve the consent decree over the Anacostia Riverkeeper s objection, but its participation is not expected to materially affect the progress or outcome
of the consent decree negotiations.        Solid and Hazardous Waste     
    Cotter Corporation.       The EPA has advised Cotter Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd
subsidiary, that it is potentially liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. On February 18, 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed
to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising in connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was transferred to Generation. On May 29, 2008, the EPA
issued a Record of Decision approving the remediation option submitted by Cotter and the two other PRPs that required additional landfill cover. The current estimated cost of the landfill cover remediation for the site is approximately $90 million,
which will be allocated among all PRPs. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated share of such liability. By letter dated January 11, 2010, the EPA requested that the PRPs perform a supplemental
feasibility study for a remediation alternative that would involve complete excavation of the radiological contamination. On September 30, 2011, the PRPs submitted the supplemental feasibility study to the EPA for review. Since June 2012, the EPA
has requested that the PRPs perform a series of additional analyses and groundwater and soil sampling as part of the supplemental feasibility study, that are now scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2016 to enable the EPA to propose a
remedy for public comment by the end of 2016. While the EPA has not yet formally announced a change in the schedule, the PRPs believe that the final supplemental feasibility study will not be completed until year-end 2016 and the EPA
announcement of the proposed remedy will take place in the third quarter of 2017. Thereafter, the EPA will select a final remedy and enter into a Consent Decree with the PRPs to effectuate the remedy. Recent investigation has identified a
number of other parties who may be PRPs and could be liable to contribute to the final remedy. Further investigation is underway. Generation believes that a partial excavation remedy is reasonably possible, but does not currently have a basis to
establish a reasonable estimate of the range of costs. Generation believes the likelihood that the EPA would require a complete excavation remedy is remote. The cost of a partial or complete excavation could have a material, unfavorable impact on
Generation s and Exelon s future results of operations and cash flows.      During December 2015, the
EPA took two actions related to the West Lake Landfill designed to abate what it termed as imminent and dangerous conditions at the landfill. The first involved installation by the PRPs of a non-combustible surface cover to protect against surface
fires in areas where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated liability for this interim action. The second action involved EPA s public
statement that it will require the PRPs to construct a barrier wall in an adjacent landfill to prevent a subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the

West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, EPA has not provided sufficient details related to the basis for and the requirements and design
of a barrier wall to enable Generation to determine the likelihood such a remedy will ultimately be implemented, assess the degree to which Generation may have liability as a potentially responsible party, or develop a reasonable estimate of the
potential incremental costs. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Generation s and Exelon s future results of operations and cash flows. Finally, one of the other
PRP s, the landfill owner and operator of the adjacent landfill, has indicated that it will be making a contribution claim against Cotter for costs that it has incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West
Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, Generation and Exelon do not possess sufficient information to assess this claim and are therefore unable to determine the impact on their future results of
operations and cash flows.      On February 2, 2016, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to transfer remediation
authority over the West Lake Landfill from the EPA to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Such legislation would become final upon passage in the U.S. House of Representatives and the
signature of the President, and be subject to annual funding appropriations in the U.S. Budget. Remediation under FUSRAP would not alter the liability of the PRPs, but could delay the determination of a final remedy and its implementation.
     On August 8, 2011, Cotter was notified by the DOJ that Cotter is considered a PRP with respect to the
government s clean-up costs for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a former storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. The Latty Avenue site is included in ComEd s
indemnification responsibilities discussed above as part of the sale of Cotter. The radioactive residues had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ores as part of the U.S. government s Manhattan Project. Cotter
purchased the residues in 1969 for initial processing at the Latty Avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metals. In 1976, the NRC found that the Latty Avenue site had radiation levels exceeding NRC criteria for decontamination
of land areas. Latty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under the FUSRAP. The DOJ has not yet formally advised the PRPs of the amount that it is seeking, but it is believed to be
approximately $90 million. The DOJ and the PRPs agreed to toll the statute of limitations until August 2017 so that settlement discussions could proceed. Based on Generation s preliminary review, it appears probable that Generation has
liability to Cotter under the indemnification agreement and has established an appropriate accrual for this liability.      Commencing in February 2012, 63 lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Among the defendants were Exelon, Generation and ComEd, all of which were
subsequently dismissed from the case, and Cotter, which remains a defendant. The suits allege that individuals living in the North St. Louis area developed some form of cancer due to Cotter s negligent or reckless conduct in processing,
transporting, storing, handling and/or disposing of radioactive materials. Plaintiffs have asserted claims for negligence, strict liability, emotional distress, medical monitoring, and violations of the Price-Anderson Act. The complaints do not
contain specific damage claims. In the event of a finding of liability, it is reasonably possible that Exelon would be considered liable due to its indemnification responsibilities of Cotter described above. The court has dismissed the lawsuits
filed by 30 of the plaintiffs. Pre-trial motions and discovery are proceeding in the remaining cases and a pre-trial scheduling order has been filed with the court. At this stage of the litigation, Generation and ComEd cannot estimate a range of
loss, if any.        68      th       Street Dump.      In 1999, the EPA proposed to add the 68th Street Dump in Baltimore, Maryland to the Superfund National
Priorities List, and notified BGE and 19 others that they are PRPs at the site. In March 2004, BGE and other PRPs formed the 68th Street Coalition and entered into consent order negotiations with the EPA

to investigate clean-up options for the site under the Superfund Alternative Sites Program. In May 2006, a settlement among the EPA and 19 of the PRPs, including BGE, with respect to
investigation of the site became effective. The settlement requires the PRPs, over the course of several years, to identify contamination at the site and recommend clean-up options. The PRPs submitted their investigation of the range of clean-up
options in the first quarter of 2011. Although the investigation and options provided to the EPA are still subject to EPA review and selection of a remedy, the range of estimated clean-up costs to be allocated among all of the PRPs is in the range
of $50 million to $64 million. On September 30, 2013, EPA issued the Record of Decision identifying its preferred remedial alternative for the site. The estimated cost for the alternative chosen by EPA is consistent with the PRPs estimated
range of costs noted above. A wholly owned subsidiary of Generation has agreed to indemnify BGE for most of the costs related to this settlement and clean-up of the site. Based on Generation s preliminary review, it appears probable that
Generation has liability and has established an appropriate accrual which are included in the table above for its share of the estimated clean-up costs.        Rossville Ash Site.      The Rossville Ash Site is a 32-acre property located in Rosedale, Baltimore County, Maryland, which was used for the placement of fly ash from
1983-2007. The property is owned by Constellation Power Source Generation, LLC (CPSG). In 2008, CPSG investigated and remediated the property by entering it into the Maryland Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) to address any historic environmental
concerns and ready the site for appropriate future redevelopment. The site was accepted into the program in 2010 and is currently going through the process to remediate the site and receive closure from MDE. Generation currently estimates the
remaining cost to close the site to be approximately $6 million which has been fully reserved and included in the table above as of September 30, 2016.        Sauer Dump.          On May 30, 2012, BGE was notified by the EPA that it is considered a PRP at the Sauer Dump Superfund site in Dundalk, Maryland. The EPA
offered BGE and three other PRPs the opportunity to conduct an environmental investigation and present cleanup recommendations at the site. In addition, the EPA is seeking recovery from the PRPs of $1.7 million for past cleanup and investigation
costs at the site. On March 11, 2013, BGE and three other PRP s signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA which requires the PRP s to conduct a remedial investigation (RI) and feasibility study
(FS) at the site to determine what, if any, are the appropriate and recommended cleanup activities for the site. The ultimate outcome of this proceeding is uncertain. Since the EPA has not selected a cleanup remedy and the allocation of the cleanup
costs among the PRPs has not been determined, BGE cannot estimate the range of loss.   
    Riverside.      In 2013, the MDE, at the request of EPA, conducted a site inspection and
limited environmental sampling of certain portions of the 170 acre Riverside property owned by BGE. The site consists of several different parcels with different current and historical uses. The sampling included soil and groundwater samples for a
number of potential environmental contaminants. The sampling confirmed the existence of contaminants consistent with the known historical uses of the various portions of the site. In March 2014, the MDE requested that BGE conduct an investigation
which included a site-wide investigation of soils, sediment, groundwater, and surface water to complement the MDE sampling. The field investigation was completed in January 2015, and a final report was provided to MDE on June 2, 2015. On November 3,
2015, MDE provided BGE with its comments and recommendations on the report which require BGE to conduct further investigation and sampling at the site to better delineate the nature and extent of historic contamination, including off-site sediment
and soil sampling. MDE did not request any interim remediation at this time and BGE anticipates completing the additional work requested by the end of the first quarter of 2017. BGE has established what it believes is an appropriate reserve
based upon the investigation to date. The established reserve is included in the table above. As the investigation and potential remediation proceed, it is possible that additional reserves could be established, in amounts that could be material to
BGE.        Benning Road Site.      In September 2010, PHI received a letter from
EPA identifying the Benning Road site as one of six land-based sites potentially contributing to contamination of the lower Anacostia River. A portion

of the site was formerly the location of a Pepco Energy Services electric generating facility. That generating facility was deactivated in June 2012 and plant structure demolition was completed
in July 2015. The remaining portion of the site consists of a Pepco transmission and distribution service center that remains in operation. The principal contaminants allegedly of concern are polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a consent decree entered into by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services with the DOEE, which requires Pepco and Pepco Energy Services to conduct a RI/FS for the
Benning Road site and an approximately 10 to 15 acre portion of the adjacent Anacostia River. The RI/FS will form the basis for the remedial actions for the Benning Road site and for the Anacostia River sediment associated with the site. The consent
decree does not obligate Pepco or Pepco Energy Services to pay for or perform any remediation work, but it is anticipated that DOEE will look to Pepco and Pepco Energy Services to assume responsibility for cleanup of any conditions in the river that
are determined to be attributable to past activities at the Benning Road site.      The initial RI field work
began in January 2013 and was completed in December 2014. In addition, in conjunction with the power plant demolition activities, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services collected soil samples adjacent to and beneath the concrete basins for the dismantled
cooling towers for the generating facility. This sampling showed localized areas of soil contamination associated with the cooling tower basins, and, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services expect to implement a plan
approved by DOEE to remove contaminated soil in conjunction with the demolition and removal of the concrete basins. On April 30, 2015, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services submitted a draft RI Report to DOEE. After review, DOEE determined that additional
field investigation and data analysis is required to complete the RI process (much of which is beyond the scope of the original DOEE-approved RI work plan). In the meantime, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services revised the draft RI Report to address
DOEE s comments and DOEE released the draft RI Report for public review on February 29, 2016. The additional field investigation and data analysis will proceed later in 2016 according to a schedule to be developed by Pepco and Pepco Energy
Services and approved by DOEE. Once the additional RI work has been completed, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services will issue a draft  final  RI report for review and comment by DOEE and the public. Pepco and Pepco Energy Services will then
proceed with an FS to evaluate possible remedial alternatives. This effort also may include a treatability study to evaluate the effectiveness of potential remedial options. Once the FS evaluation has been completed, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services
will prepare and submit a draft FS Report for review and comment by DOEE and the public. Thereafter, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services will revise the draft FS Report as appropriate to address comments received and will submit a final FS Report to
DOEE.      Upon DOEE s approval of the final remedial investigation and feasibility study Reports, Pepco and
Pepco Energy Services will have satisfied their obligations under the consent decree. At that point, DOEE will prepare a Proposed Plan regarding further response actions based on the results of the remedial investigation and feasibility study. After
considering public comment on the Proposed Plan, DOEE will issue a Record of Decision identifying any further response actions determined to be necessary.      PHI, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services have determined that a loss associated with this matter for PHI, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services is probable and an estimated liability for this issue has been
accrued, which is included in the table above. As the remedial investigation proceeds and potential remedies are identified, it is possible that additional reserves could be established in amounts that could be material to PHI, Pepco and Pepco
Energy Services. Pursuant to Exelon s March 2016 acquisition of PHI, Pepco Energy Services was transferred to Generation. The ultimate resolution of this matter is currently not expected to have any significant financial impact on Generation.
      Anacostia River Tidal Reach.     Contemporaneous with the Benning RI/FS being
performed by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services, DOEE and certain federal agencies have been conducting a separate RI/FS focused on the entire tidal reach of the Anacostia River extending from just north of the Maryland-D.C. boundary line to the

confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. On March 18, 2016, DOEE released a draft of the river-wide RI Report for public review and comment. The river-wide RI incorporated the results of
the river sampling performed by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services as part of the Benning RI/FS, as well as similar sampling efforts conducted by owners of other sites adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by
DOEE s contractor. DOEE asked Pepco, along with parties responsible for other sites along the river, to participate in a  Consultative Working Group  to provide input into the process for future remedial actions addressing the entire
tidal reach of the river and to ensure proper coordination with the other river cleanup efforts currently underway, including cleanup of the river segment adjacent to the Benning Road site resulting from the Benning Road RI/FS. Pepco responded that
it will participate in the Consultative Working Group but its participation is not an acceptance of any financial responsibility beyond the work that will be performed at the Benning Road site described above. On September 13, 2016 PHI attended the
first Consultative Working Group meeting along with several other possible private and governmental PRP s. At the meeting it was disclosed that the federal and DOEE authorities were conducting phase 2 of a remedial investigation, DOEE has
targeted June 2018 as the date for remedy selection for clean-up of sediments in this section of the river. The Consultative Working Group and the other possible PRPs raised a number of issues with the proposed clean-up process and schedule.
Several follow up meetings have been scheduled. At this time, it is not possible to predict the extent of Pepco s participation in the river-wide RI/FS process, or its potential exposure for response costs beyond those associated with the
Benning RI/FS component of the river-wide initiative.        Conectiv Energy Wholesale Power Generation
Sites.      In July 2010, PHI sold the wholesale power generation business of Conectiv Energy Holdings, Inc. and substantially all of its subsidiaries (Conectiv Energy) to Calpine Corporation (Calpine). Under New
Jersey s Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA), the transfer of ownership triggered an obligation on the part of Conectiv Energy to remediate any environmental contamination at each of the nine Conectiv Energy generating facility sites located in
New Jersey. Under the terms of the sale, Calpine has assumed responsibility for performing the ISRA-required remediation and for the payment of all related ISRA compliance costs up to $10 million. PHI is obligated to indemnify Calpine for any ISRA
compliance remediation costs in excess of $10 million. According to PHI s estimates, the costs of ISRA-required remediation activities at the 9 generating facility sites located in New Jersey are in the range of approximately $7 million to $18
million, and PHI has established an appropriate accrual for its share of the estimated clean-up costs, which is included in the table above.        Rock Creek Mineral Oil Release.      In late August 2015, a Pepco underground transmission line in the District of Columbia suffered a breach, resulting in the release of
non-toxic mineral oil surrounding the transmission line into the surrounding soil, and a small amount reached Rock Creek through a storm drain. Pepco notified regulatory authorities, and Pepco and its spill response contractors placed booms in Rock
Creek, blocked the storm drain to prevent the release of mineral oil into the creek and commenced remediation of soil around the transmission line and the Rock Creek shoreline. Pepco estimates that approximately 6,100 gallons of mineral oil were
released and that its remediation efforts recovered approximately 80% of the amount released. Pepco s remediation efforts are ongoing under the direction of the DOEE, including the requirements of a February 29, 2016 compliance order which
requires Pepco to prepare a full incident investigation report and prepare a removal action work plan to remove all impacted soils in the vicinity of the storm drain outfall, and in collaboration with the National Park Service, the Smithsonian
Institution/National Zoo and EPA. Pepco s investigation presently indicates that the damage to Pepco s facilities occurred prior to the release of mineral oil when third-party excavators struck the Pepco underground transmission line while
installing cable for another utility.      To the extent recovery is available against any party who contributed
to this loss, PHI and Pepco will pursue such action. Exelon, PHI and Pepco continue to investigate the cause of the incident, the parties involved, and legal responsibility under District of Columbia law, but do not believe that the remediation
costs to resolve this matter will have a material adverse effect on their respective financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

     Peck Iron and Metal Site.      EPA
informed Pepco in a May 2009 letter that Pepco may be a PRP under CERCLA with respect to the cleanup of the Peck Iron and Metal site in Portsmouth, Virginia, and for costs EPA has incurred in cleaning up the site. The EPA letter states that Peck
Iron and Metal purchased, processed, stored and shipped metal scrap from military bases, governmental agencies and businesses and that the Peck Iron and Metal scrap operations resulted in the improper storage and disposal of hazardous substances.
EPA bases its allegation on its belief that Pepco was a customer at the site. Pepco has advised EPA by letter that its records show no evidence of any sale of scrap metal by Pepco to the site. Even if EPA has such records and such sales did occur,
Pepco believes that any such scrap metal sales may be entitled to the recyclable material exemption from CERCLA liability. In September 2011, EPA initiated a RI/FS for the site using Federal funds. Pepco cannot at this time estimate an amount or
range of reasonably possible loss associated with this RI/FS, any remediation activities to be performed at the site or any other costs that EPA might seek to impose on Pepco.   
    Brandywine Fly Ash Disposal Site.      In February 2013, Pepco received a letter from the
MDE requesting that Pepco investigate the extent of waste on a Pepco right-of-way that traverses the Brandywine fly ash disposal site in Brandywine, Prince George s County, Maryland, owned by NRG Energy, Inc. (as successor to GenOn MD Ash
Management, LLC) (NRG). In July 2013, while reserving its rights and related defenses under a 2000 agreement covering the sale of this site, Pepco indicated its willingness to investigate the extent of, and propose an appropriate closure plan to
address, ash on the right-of-way. Pepco submitted a schedule for development of a closure plan to MDE on September 30, 2013 and, by letter dated October 18, 2013, MDE approved the schedule.   
  Exelon, PHI and Pepco have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have estimated that the
costs for implementation of a closure plan and cap on the site are in the range of approximately $3 million to $6 million. Exelon, PHI and Pepco believe that the costs incurred in this matter will be recoverable from NRG under the 2000 sale
agreement.       Litigation and Regulatory Matters         Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          Exelon, Generation and PECO   .     Generation maintains a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions in certain facilities that are
currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The reserve is recorded on an undiscounted basis and excludes the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.   
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Generation had reserved approximately $83 million and $95 million,
respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $22 million of this amount related to 237 open claims presented to Generation, while the remaining $61 million of the reserve is for
estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2050, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, Generation monitors actual experience against the
number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluates whether an adjustment to the reserve is necessary. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Generation decreased its reserve by approximately $8
million, primarily attributable to a continued decline in expected claims activity.      On November 22,
2013, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Act does not apply to an employee s disability or death resulting from occupational disease, such as diseases related to asbestos exposure, which manifests
more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based exposure, and that therefore the exclusivity provision of the Act does not preclude such employee from suing his or her employer in court. The Supreme Court s ruling reverses
previous rulings by the Pennsylvania Superior Court precluding current and former employees from suing their employers in court,   
         177

despite the fact that the same employee was not eligible for workers compensation benefits for diseases that manifest more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based exposure
to asbestos. Since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court s ruling in November 2013, Exelon, Generation, and PECO have experienced an increase in asbestos-related personal injury claims brought by former PECO employees, all of which have been reserved
for on a claim by claim basis. Those additional claims are taken into account in projecting estimates of future asbestos-related bodily injury claims.      On November 4, 2015, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the provisions of the Illinois  Workers  Compensation Act and the Workers  Occupational Diseases Act barred an employee from
bringing a direct civil action against an employer for latent diseases, including asbestos-related diseases that fall outside the 25-year limit of the statute of repose. The Illinois Supreme Court s ruling reversed previous rulings by the
Illinois Court of Appeals, which initially ruled that the Illinois Worker s Compensation law should not apply in cases where the diagnosis of an asbestos related disease occurred after the 25-year maximum time period for filing a Worker s
Compensation claim. Since the Illinois Supreme Court s ruling in November 2015, Exelon, Generation, and ComEd have not experienced a significant increase in asbestos-related personal injury claims brought by former ComEd employees.   
  There is a reasonable possibility that Exelon may have additional exposure to estimated future asbestos-related bodily
injury claims in excess of the amount accrued and the increases could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO and BGE s future results of operations and cash flows.   
    BGE   .     Since 1993, BGE and certain Constellation (now Generation) subsidiaries
have been involved in several actions concerning asbestos. The actions are based upon the theory of  premises liability,  alleging that BGE and Generation knew of and exposed individuals to an asbestos hazard. In addition to BGE and
Generation, numerous other parties are defendants in these cases.      Approximately 456 individuals who were
never employees of BGE or certain Constellation subsidiaries have pending claims each seeking several million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. Cross-claims and third-party claims brought by other defendants may also be filed against BGE
and certain Constellation subsidiaries in these actions. To date, most asbestos claims which have been resolved have been dismissed or resolved without any payment by BGE or certain Constellation subsidiaries and a small minority of these cases has
been resolved for amounts that were not material to BGE or Generation s financial results.      Discovery
begins in these cases after they are placed on the trial docket. Given the limited discovery in these cases, BGE and Generation do not know the specific facts that are necessary to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss relating to
these claims; as such, no accrual has been made and a range of loss is not estimable. The specific facts not known include:       

the identity of the facilities at which the plaintiffs allegedly worked as contractors;      

the names of the plaintiffs  employers;          

the dates on which and the places where the exposure allegedly occurred; and      

the facts and circumstances relating to the alleged exposure.      
  Insurance and hold harmless agreements from contractors who employed the plaintiffs may cover a portion of any awards in
the actions.

     Continuous Power Interruption (Exelon and ComEd)     
  Section 16-125 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act provides that in the event an electric utility, such as ComEd,
experiences a continuous power interruption of four hours or more that affects (in ComEd s case) more than 30,000 customers, the utility may be liable for actual damages suffered by customers as a result of the interruption and may be
responsible for reimbursement of local governmental emergency and contingency expenses incurred in connection with the interruption. Recovery of consequential damages is barred. The affected utility may seek from the ICC a waiver of these
liabilities when the utility can show that the cause of the interruption was unpreventable damage due to weather events or conditions, customer tampering, or certain other causes enumerated in the law. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, ComEd did not have any material liabilities recorded for these storm events.        Baltimore City
Franchise Taxes (Exelon and BGE)        The City of Baltimore claims that BGE has maintained electric
facilities in the City s public right-of-ways for over one hundred years without the proper franchise rights from the City. BGE has reviewed the City s claim and believes that it lacks merit. BGE has not recorded an accrual for
payment of franchise fees for past periods as a range of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Franchise fees assessed in future periods may be material to BGE s results of operations and cash flows.   
    Deere Wind Energy Assets (Exelon and Generation)     
  In 2013, Deere   Company ( Deere ) filed a lawsuit against Generation in the Delaware Superior Court
relating to Generation s acquisition of the Deere wind energy assets. Under the purchase agreement, Deere was entitled to receive earn-out payments if certain specific wind projects already under development in Michigan met certain
development and construction milestones following the sale. In the complaint, Deere seeks to recover a $14 million earn-out payment associated with one such project, which was never completed. Generation has filed counterclaims against
Deere for breach of contract, with a right of recoupment and set off. On June 2, 2016, the Delaware Superior Court entered summary judgment in favor of Deere. Generation is reviewing the decision and determining whether to appeal to the Delaware
Supreme Court. Generation has accrued an amount to cover its potential liability.        General (All Registrants)
       The Registrants are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled
in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. The Registrants
maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are
indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a
possible eventual loss.       Income Taxes    (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)

    In January 2015, in connection with Generation s $750 million issuance of five-year Senior Unsecured Notes, Exelon terminated certain
floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. As the original forecasted transactions were a series of future interest payments over a ten year period, a portion of the anticipated interest payments were probable not to occur. As a result, $26 million of
anticipated payments were reclassified from AOCI to Other, net in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

     Supplemental Balance Sheet Information     
  The following tables provide additional information about assets and liabilities of the Registrants as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       

(a)  
    Includes accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel in the reactor core of $3,198 million.

    PECO Installment Plan Receivables (Exelon and PECO)     
  PECO enters into payment agreements with certain delinquent customers, primarily residential, seeking to restore their
service, as required by the PAPUC. Customers with past due balances that meet certain income criteria are provided the option to enter into an installment payment plan, some of which have terms greater than one year, to repay past due balances in
addition to paying for their ongoing service on a current basis. The receivable balance for these payment agreement receivables is recorded in accounts receivable for the current portion and other deferred debits and other assets for the noncurrent
portion. The net receivable balance for installment plans with terms greater than one year was $16 million and $15 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible accounts reserve
methodology and assessment of the credit quality of the installment plan receivables are consistent with the customer accounts receivable methodology discussed in Note 1   Significant Accounting Policies of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K. The
allowance for uncollectible accounts balance associated with these receivables at September 30, 2016 of $14 million consists of $0 million, $3 million and $11 million for low risk, medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The allowance
for uncollectible accounts balance at December 31, 2015 of $15 million consists of $1 million, $3 million and $11 million for low risk, medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The balance of the payment agreement is billed to the
customer in equal monthly installments over the term of the agreement. Installment receivables outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include balances not yet presented on the customer bill, accounts currently billed
and an immaterial amount of past due receivables. When a customer defaults on its payment agreement, the terms of which are defined by plan type, the entire balance of the agreement becomes due and the balance is reclassified to current customer
accounts receivable and reserved for in accordance with the methodology discussed in Note 1   Significant Accounting Policies of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K.

      20.    Segment Information (All Registrants)
      Operating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on information used by the chief
operating decision maker(s) (CODM) in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.      In the first quarter of 2016, following the consummation of the PHI Merger, three new reportable segments were added: Pepco, DPL and ACE. As a result, Exelon has twelve reportable segments, which
include ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI s three reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE, and Generation s six power marketing reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and all other power
regions referred to collectively as  Other Power Regions , which includes activities in the South, West and Canada. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment
information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE s CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE based on net income and return on equity.   
  Effective with the consummation of the PHI Merger, PHI s reportable segments have changed based on the information
used by the CODM to evaluate performance and allocate resources. PHI s reportable segments consist of Pepco, DPL and ACE. PHI s Predecessor periods  segment information has been recast to conform to the current presentation. The
reclassification of the segment information did not impact PHI s reported consolidated revenues or net income. PHI s CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to Pepco, DPL and ACE based on net income and return on equity.
     The basis for Generation s reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business
that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail).
Generation s hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of Generation s six reportable segments are as follows:   

Mid-Atlantic  represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the
District of Columbia and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.          

Midwest  represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan,
Kentucky and Tennessee, and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO s Southern Region, which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan
and Ohio not covered by PJM, and parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky.          

New England  represents the operations within ISO-NE covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and
Vermont.          

New York  represents operations within ISO-NY, which covers the state of New York in its entirety.      

ERCOT  represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas.      

Other Power Regions :          

South  represents operations in the FRCC, MISO s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of the SERC not included within MISO or PJM,
which includes all or most of Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and parts of Missouri, Kentucky and Texas. Generation s South region also includes operations in the SPP,
covering Kansas, Oklahoma, most of Nebraska and parts of New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.

       (Dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)    

West  represents operations in the WECC, which includes California ISO, and covers the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona,
Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Colorado and parts of New Mexico, Wyoming and South Dakota.          

Canada  represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO and the Canadian portion of MISO.
        The CODMs for Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of Generation s power
marketing activities and allocate resources based on revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense (RNF). Generation believes that RNF is a useful measurement of operational performance. RNF is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be
comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to the Utility
Registrants. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for Generation s owned generation and fuel
costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of Generation s other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional reportable segment
amounts. These activities include natural gas, as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to Generation s overall operating revenues or results of operations. Further, Generation s unrealized mark-to-market
gains and losses on economic hedging activities and its amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also not included in the regional reportable
segment amounts. Exelon and Generation do not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance of these reportable segments.

   Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a
non-GAAP measure discussed below, increased by $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was
primarily due to the following favorable factors:       

Increase of $57 million at ComEd primarily due to increased distribution and transmission formula rate revenue resulting from favorable weather and
increased capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed electric distribution ROE due to a decrease in treasury rates, as well as, favorable weather;      

Increase of $54 million at PECO primarily due to increased electric distribution revenue pursuant to a rate increase effective January 1, 2016, as
well as favorable summer weather;          

Increase of $38 million at BGE primarily due to increased transmission revenue as a result of increased capital investments and operating and
maintenance expense recoveries and increased distribution revenue pursuant to a rate increase effective in June 2016; and          
    The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating revenue net of purchased
power and fuel expense was partially offset by a decrease of $58 million at Generation due to decreased capacity prices and lower realized energy prices in the Mid-Atlantic region.   
  Operating and maintenance expense increased by $342 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015 primarily due to the following unfavorable factors:       

Increase in Generation s labor, contracting and materials cost of $106 million related to the inclusion of Pepco Energy Services results in
2016;          

Increase of $7 million at BGE primarily due to increased conduit rental fees assessed by the City of Baltimore; and      
   
    The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating and maintenance expense was
partially offset by a decrease of $20 million in pension and non-pension post-retirement benefits resulting from the favorable impact of higher pension and OPEB discount rates in 2016.   
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $589 million primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation and
amortization expense related to Generation s 2016 decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization at Generation, increased depreciation expense due to ongoing
capital expenditures across all operating companies, and the inclusion of PHI s results for the period of July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016.      Taxes other than income increased by $139 million primarily due to increased property and utility taxes as a result of the inclusion of PHI s results for the period of July 1, 2016 to September 30,
2016.      Interest expense, net increased by $263 million primarily due to the recognition of the interest due on
the asserted penalty related to the Tax Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, the inclusion of PHI s results for the period of July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and higher outstanding debt to fund the PHI
acquisition and general corporate purposes.   
         200

Table of Contents  

   Other, net increased by $364 million primarily due to the recognition of the
penalty related to the Tax Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position and the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds at Generation.   
  Exelon s effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 39.0% and 16.4%,
respectively. See Note 11   Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.   
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015.       Exelon s net income attributable to common shareholders was $930 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,959 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and
diluted earnings per average common share were $1.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
  Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a non-GAAP measure discussed below, increased by $1.5
billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The year-over-year increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to the following favorable factors:   

Increase of $172 million at ComEd primarily due to increased distribution and transmission formula rate revenue resulting from increased capital
investment, as well as, favorable weather;          

Increase of $76 million at BGE primarily due to increased transmission revenue as a result of increased capital investments and operating and
maintenance expense recoveries and increased distribution revenue pursuant to a rate increase effective in June 2016;          

Increase of $51 million at PECO primarily due to increased electric distribution revenue pursuant to a rate increase effective January 1, 2016;

Increase of $20 million at Generation primarily due to approval of the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement, decreased nuclear fuel prices
and decreased nuclear outage days at higher capacity units, partially offset by lower realized energy prices, and higher oil inventory write downs; and      
   
    The year-over-year increase in operating revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense was partially offset by a decrease of $371 million at Generation due to mark-to-market losses of $113 million in 2016 from economic hedging activities as compared to gains of $258 million in 2015.   
  Operating and maintenance expense increased by $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015 primarily due to the following unfavorable factors:       

Approval of the merger across all regulatory jurisdictions was conditioned on Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments pursuant to which, upon
acquisition close, Exelon recorded $513 million of costs;         

Long-lived asset impairments of Upstream assets and certain wind projects at Generation of $171 million;      

Increase of $146 million at Generation for the recognition of one-time charges associated with Generation s 2016 decision to early retire the
Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating facilities;          

Increase in Generation s labor, contracting and materials cost of $144 million related to the inclusion of Pepco Energy Services results in
2016;          

Increase of $52 million at BGE as a result of one-time charges associated with the reduction of certain regulatory assets and other long-lived
assets stemming from certain cost disallowances contained within the smart grid rate case orders issued by the MDPSC in June and July 2016;          

Increase of $22 million at BGE due to increased conduit rental fees assessed by the City of Baltimore;

Increased storm costs at BGE of $19 million; and          
    The year-over-year increase in operating and maintenance
expense was partially offset by the following favorable factors:       

Decrease of $60 million in pension and non-pension post-retirement benefits resulting from the favorable impact of higher pension and OPEB discount
rates in 2016;          

Decrease of $31 million in the provision for uncollectible accounts at ComEd, PECO and BGE; and      

Decrease of $9 million at PECO due to lower incremental storm costs in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, as a
result of the June 2015 storm.         Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1,003
million primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation and amortization expense related to Generation s 2016 decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning
amortization at Generation, increased depreciation expense due to ongoing capital expenditures across all operating companies, and the inclusion of PHI s results for the period of March 24, 2016 to September 30, 2016.   
  Taxes other than income increased by $260 million primarily due to increased property and utility taxes as a result of
the inclusion of PHI s results for the period March 24, 2016 to September 30, 2016.      Gain on sales of
assets increased by $31 million primarily as a result of the gain associated with Generation s sale of the retired New Boston generating site.      Interest expense, net increased by $424 million primarily due to the recognition of the interest due on the asserted penalty related to the Tax Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange
tax position, higher outstanding debt to fund the PHI acquisition and general corporate purposes and the absence of the forward-starting interest rate swaps in 2016.   
  Other, net increased by $556 million primarily due to the recognition of the penalty related to the Tax Court s
decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds at Generation and the absence of a $26 million loss in 2015 on the termination of forward-starting interest rate swaps.
     Exelon s effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 39.1% and
29.1%, respectively. See Note 11   Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates. As a result of the merger, Exelon recorded an
after-tax charge of $91 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE uncertain tax positions.   
  For further detail regarding the financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, including
explanation of the non-GAAP measure revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, see the discussions of Results of Operations by Segment below.        Non-GAAP Financial Measures        Exelon s adjusted
(non-GAAP) operating earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $841 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $757 million, or $0.83 per diluted share for the same period in 2015.
Exelon s adjusted (non-GAAP) operating

earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,078 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $1,880 million, or $2.13 per diluted
share for the same period in 2015. In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings
because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This
information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not
directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and
planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations. The Company has provided non-GAAP financial
measures as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to
the most comparable GAAP measures provided elsewhere in this report.      The following table provides a
reconciliation between net income attributable to common shareholders as determined in accordance with GAAP and adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015.

     Exelon s Strategy and Outlook for the remainder of 2016 and Beyond     
  Exelon s value proposition and competitive advantage come from its scope and its core strengths of operational
excellence and financial discipline. Exelon leverages its integrated business model to create value. Exelon s regulated and competitive businesses feature a mix of attributes that, when combined, offer shareholders and customers a unique value
proposition:       

Exelon s utilities provide a foundation for steadily growing earnings, which translates to a stable currency in our stock.

Generation s competitive businesses provide free cash flow to support investment in Exelon s utilities and long-term, contracted
assets at Generation, and debt reduction.         Exelon believes its strategy provides a platform
for optimal success in an energy industry experiencing fundamental and sweeping change.      Exelon s utility
strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. The Exelon utilities only invest in rate base where it provides a benefit to
customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. The Exelon utilities make these investments prudently and at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its
scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. Additionally, the Utility Registrants anticipate making significant future
investments in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.   
  Generation s competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative energy solutions and
reliable, clean and affordable energy. Generation s electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide generation to load matching to reduce earnings volatility. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to
deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation s customer facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation operates in well-developed
energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source
diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.      Several nuclear units within the Exelon fleet and nationally are economically challenged, threatened by persistently low prices and out-of-market payments to select generation sources. Some units have
already retired prematurely for economic reasons, and Exelon has announced the planned early shutdown of its Clinton and Quad Cities units. Other Exelon units face similar challenges, most notably Ginna, Nine Mile Point and TMI. In August 2016,
the New York Public Service Commission issued an order adopting the Clean Energy Standard (CES), designed to provide payments under a Zero Emissions Credit program to Generation s Ginna and Nine Mile Point and Entergy s James A.
FitzPatrick nuclear plants in recognition of the environmental benefits of their zero emissions attributes. Exelon is working to develop other potential solutions at the state, federal and RTO levels so that markets and/or the states more
appropriately value the carbon-free emission attribute of nuclear generation.      Exelon s financial
priorities are to maintain investment grade credit metrics at each of the Registrants to maintain optimal capital structure and to return value to Exelon s shareholders with an attractive dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle
and through stable earnings growth. Exelon s Board of Directors approved a revised dividend policy. The approved policy raises our dividend 2.5% each year for the next three years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend.   
         207

   Various market, financial, and other factors could affect the
Registrants  success in pursuing their strategies. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional
information regarding market and financial factors.      Continually optimizing the cost structure is a key
component of Exelon s financial strategy. Through a recent focused cost management program, the company has committed to reducing operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs by approximately $350 million and $50 million,
respectively, of which approximately 35% of run-rate savings are expected to be achieved by the end of 2016 and fully realized in 2018. At least 75% of the savings are expected to be allocated to Generation, with the remaining amount allocated
to the Utility Registrants. Exelon anticipates the earnings per share savings impact on EPS will be within $0.13 to $0.18 from 2018 forward.   
    Early Nuclear Plant Retirements        Exelon and Generation continue to evaluate the current and expected economic value of each of Generation s nuclear plants. Factors that will continue to affect the economic value of Generation s
nuclear plants include, but are not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative and regulatory solutions to ensure nuclear plants are fairly compensated for their carbon-free emissions, and the impact of
final rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of states to implement those final rules.      In 2015, Generation identified the Quad Cities, Clinton and Ginna nuclear plants as having the greatest risk of early retirement based on economic valuation and other factors. At that time, Exelon and
Generation deferred retirement decisions on Clinton and Quad Cities until 2016 in order to participate in the 2016-2017 MISO primary reliability auction and the 2019-2020 PJM capacity auctions held in April and May 2016, respectively, as well as to
provide Illinois policy makers with additional time to consider needed reforms and for MISO to consider market design changes to ensure long-term power system reliability in southern Illinois.   
  In April 2016, Clinton cleared the MISO primary reliability auction as a price taker for the 2016-2017 planning year. The
resulting capacity price is insufficient to cover cash operating costs and a risk-adjusted rate of return to shareholders. In May 2016, Quad Cities did not clear in the PJM capacity auction for the 2019-2020 planning year and will not receive
capacity revenue for that period.      Based on these capacity auction results, and given the lack of progress on
Illinois energy legislation and MISO market reforms, on June 2, 2016 Generation announced it will move forward to shut down the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants on June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, respectively. The current Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) licenses for Clinton and Quad Cities expire in 2026 and 2032, respectively. Generation is proceeding with the market and regulatory notifications that must be made to shut down the plants, including notification to the NRC on June
20, 2016, and filing of a deactivation notice with PJM for Quad Cities on July 6, 2016. Generation will formally notify MISO of its plans to close Clinton later this year.

   In 2016, as a result of the plant retirement decision for Clinton and Quad
Cities, Exelon and Generation recognized one-time charges in Operating and maintenance expense of $146 million related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs and construction work-in-progress (CWIP)
impairments, among other items. In addition to these one-time charges, there will be ongoing annual incremental non-cash charges to earnings stemming from shortening the expected economic useful life of Clinton and Quad Cities primarily related to
accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any asset retirement costs (ARC)), accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, and additional asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning timing
and cost assumptions. Exelon s and Generation s third quarter 2016 results include an incremental $443 million of pre-tax expense for these items. The following table summarizes the estimated annual amount and timing of such expected
incremental non-cash expense items through 2018.

    Actual results may differ based on incremental future capital additions, actual units of production for nuclear fuel amortization, future
revised ARO assumptions, etc.

(c)  
    For Quad Cities based on the regulatory agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission, decommissioning-related activities are offset within
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to ComEd at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd.
Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and corresponding regulatory liability.         Please refer to Note 12   Nuclear Decommissioning of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on changes to the Nuclear decommissioning ARO balances resulting
from the early retirement of Clinton and Quad Cities.      The Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant also did not
clear in the May 2016 PJM capacity auction for the 2019-2020 planning year and will not receive capacity revenue for that period. This is the second consecutive year that TMI failed to clear the capacity auction. Although the plant is committed to
operate through May 2019, the plant faces continued economic challenges and Exelon and Generation are exploring all options to return it to profitability. While a portion of the Byron nuclear plant s capacity did not clear the PJM 2019-2020
planning year capacity auction, the plant is committed to run through May 2020. The company s other nuclear plants in PJM cleared in the auction, except Oyster Creek, which did not participate in the auction given Exelon s and
Generation s previous commitment to cease operation of the Oyster Creek nuclear plant by the end of 2019.   
  In New York, the Ginna and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants continue to face significant economic challenges and risk of
retirement before the end of each unit s respective operating license period (2029 for Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1, and 2046 for Nine Mile Point Unit 2). On August 1, 2016, the NYPSC issued an order adopting the Clean Energy Standard
(CES), which would provide payments to Ginna and Nine Mile Point for the environmental attributes of their production. Subject to Ginna and Nine Mile Point entering into a satisfactory contract with NYSERDA, as required under the CES, and subject to
prevailing over any administrative or legal challenges, the CES will allow Ginna and Nine Mile Point to continue to operate at least through the life of the program (March 31, 2029). The approved RSSA currently requires Ginna to continue
  
         209

Table of Contents  

operating through the RSSA term expiring in March 2017. If Ginna does not plan to retire shortly after the expiration of the RSSA, notification of that effect was required to be filed with
the NYPSC no later than September 30, 2016. On September 30, 2016, Ginna filed the required notice with the NYPSC of its intent to continue operating beyond the March 31, 2017 expiry of the RSSA, conditioned upon successful execution of an
agreement between Ginna and NYSERDA for the sale of ZECs under the CES. Negotiations with NYSERDA are ongoing and contract execution is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 5  
Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the Ginna RSSA and the New York CES.      The following table provides the balance sheet amounts as of September 30, 2016 for significant assets and liabilities associated with the three nuclear plants currently considered by management to
be at the greatest risk of early retirement due to current economic valuations and other factors.       
    Assuming the successful implementation of the CES and its continued effectiveness,
Generation and CENG would no longer consider Ginna and Nine Mile Point to be at heightened risk of early retirement; however, absent the CES for the full expected duration they will remain at heightened risk. The precise timing of an early
retirement date for any of these plants, and the resulting financial statement impacts, may be affected by a number of factors, including the status of potential regulatory or legislative solutions, results of any transmission system reliability
study assessments, the nature of any co-owner requirements and stipulations, and decommissioning trust fund requirements, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does
not have capacity obligations, where applicable, and just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage.   
  NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient
funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility. These NRC minimum funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each
unit. If a unit fails the NRC minimum funding test, then the plant s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making
additional cash contributions to the NDT fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. See Note 12   Nuclear Decommissioning to the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the NRC minimum funding
requirements.      It is currently estimated that Clinton will no longer meet the NRC minimum funding requirements
due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the NDT fund investments could appreciate in value. Quad Cities is also at risk for such a shortfall. A shortfall could require Exelon to post
parental guarantees for Generation s share of the obligations. However, the amount of any required guarantees will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site, the associated level of costs, and the decommissioning
trust fund investment performance going forward. Within two years of shutting down a plant, Generation must submit a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) to the NRC that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site.
Considering the three alternative decommissioning approaches available for each site, the most costly estimates currently anticipated could require parental guarantees of up to $375 million for Clinton in order to access its NDT fund for
radiological   
         210

decommissioning costs. Although Quad Cities is better positioned than Clinton to avoid the need for a parental guarantee, a guarantee of up to $110 million, at Generation s ownership
percentage, may be required in order for the site to access its NDT fund for radiological decommissioning costs. As of September 30, 2016, the additional plants at the highest risk of early retirement, Ginna, Nine Mile Point and TMI, pass the NRC
minimum funding test based on their current license lives. However, in the event of an early retirement the most costly estimates currently anticipated could require parental guarantees of up to $115 million, $200 million, and $65 million for Ginna,
Nine Mile Point and TMI, respectively, at Generation s ownership percentages.      Upon issuance of any
required financial guarantees, each site would be able to utilize the respective NDT funds for radiological decommissioning costs, which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs. However, the NRC must approve an additional
exemption in order for the plant s owner(s) to utilize the NDT fund to pay for non-radiological decommissioning costs (i.e. spent fuel management and site restoration costs). If a unit does not receive this exemption, the costs would be borne
by the owner(s). Accordingly, based on current projections, it is expected that some portion of the spent fuel management and/or site restoration costs would need to be funded through supplemental cash from Generation and others holding ownership
interests. While the ultimate amounts may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenarios and/or reimbursement of certain costs under the United States Department of Energy reimbursement agreements or future litigation,
across the three alternative decommissioning approaches available, for the next 10 years, Clinton could incur spent fuel management and site restoration costs of up to $160 million, net of taxes. Quad Cities is better positioned to pass the test
than Clinton. Although considered unlikely, if Quad Cities fails the exemption test, at its ownership percentage Generation could be required to pay for spent fuel management costs over the next ten years of up to $185 million, net of taxes, at
Generation s ownership percentage. If an early retirement decision is made and Ginna, Nine Mile Point, or TMI were to fail the exemption test, each could incur spent fuel management and site restoration costs over the next ten years of up to
$60 million, $140 million and $145 million, net of taxes, respectively, at Generation s ownership percentages.       Proposed Acquisition
of James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Generating Station (Exelon and Generation)       On August 8, 2016, Generation
executed a series of agreements with Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick LLC (Entergy) to acquire the 838MW single-unit James A. FitzPatrick (FitzPatrick) nuclear generating station located in Scriba, New York for a cash purchase price of $110 million. As
part of the transaction, Generation would receive the FitzPatrick NDT fund assets and assume the obligation to decommission FitzPatrick. Closing of the transaction is currently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017 and is dependent upon
regulatory approval by FERC, NRC and the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC). The transaction is also subject to the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act (which has been completed) and other customary closing
conditions. The NRC license for FitzPatrick expires in 2034. Entergy had previously announced plans in November 2015 to early retire FitzPatrick at the end of the current fuel cycle in January 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, Generation will
reimburse Entergy for approximately $200 million to $250 million of incremental costs to refuel the plant and operate and maintain the plant after the refueling outage, scheduled to end in February 2017, through the closing date. These are costs
which otherwise would have been avoided by FitzPatrick s planned permanent shutdown in January 2017. Generation will be entitled to all revenues from FitzPatrick s electricity and capacity sales for the period commencing upon
completion of the refueling outage through the acquisition closing date. The agreements provide for certain termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate if the transaction has not been consummated within 12 months due to
failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals.      On October 11, 2016, Public Citizen, Inc. filed a
protest with FERC challenging Generation and Entergy s application to FERC for the transfer of ownership of FitzPatrick. No other party to the proceeding has filed any protests or comments. Generation and Entergy had requested FERC to approve
the FitzPatrick transaction by November 18, 2016, however FERC is under no obligation to do so. The timing of FERC s decision on Generation and Entergy s application and the outcome of this protest are currently uncertain. Refer to Note 5
  Regulatory Matters for additional information on the New York CES and ZEC program.

   The transaction is expected to be accounted for as a business combination.
For accounting and financial reporting purposes the costs that Generation reimburses Entergy for as well as the revenue received from Fitzpatrick prior to the close of the transaction will be treated as part of the purchase price consideration.
Generation will record the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. To the extent the purchase price is greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired, goodwill will be recorded. To the extent the
fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain will be recorded.      As of September 30, 2016, Generation has paid a non-refundable deposit of $10 million and reimbursed Entergy for $9 million in costs all of which have been classified with Other noncurrent assets on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets for a total amount of $19 million. These amounts are also reflected within Acquisition of businesses on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
       Power Markets          Price of Fuels.      The use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on
natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in Exelon s revenues. Forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase
in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).        Capacity Market Changes
in PJM.          In the wake of the January 2014 Polar Vortex that blanketed much of the Eastern and Midwestern United States, it became clear that while a major outage event was narrowly avoided, resources in PJM
were not providing the level of reliability expected by customers. As a result, on December 12, 2014, PJM filed at FERC a proposal to make significant changes to its current capacity market construct, the Reliability Pricing Model
(RPM). PJM s proposed changes generally sought to improve resource performance and reliability largely by limiting the excuses for non-performance and by increasing the penalties for performance failures. The proposal permits suppliers to
include in capacity market offers additional costs and risk so they can meet these higher performance requirements. While offers are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing prices, operational improvements made as a result of PJM s
proposal are expected to improve reliability, to reduce energy production costs as a result of more efficient operations and to reduce the need for out of market energy payments to suppliers. Generation participated actively in PJM s
stakeholder process through which PJM developed the proposal and also actively participated in the FERC proceeding including filing comments. On June 9, 2015, FERC approved PJM s filing largely as proposed by PJM, including transitional auction
rules for delivery years 2016/2017 through 2017/2018. As a result of this and several related orders, PJM hosted its 2018/2019 Base Residual Auction (results posted on August 21, 2015), its transitional auction for delivery year 2016/2017 (results
posted on August 31, 2015), its transitional auction for delivery years 2017/2018 (results posted on September 9, 2015), and its 2019/2020 Base Residual Auction in May 2016. In June 2016, several parties appealed the FERC s decision
approving PJM s market changes to the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit. Exelon has intervened in the matter in support of FERC s decision. The outcome of this appeal is unclear at this time, but could impact earnings.   
    MISO Capacity Market Results.      On April 14, 2015, the Midcontinent Independent System
Operator (MISO) released the results of its capacity auction covering the June 2015 through May 2016 delivery year. As a result of the auction, capacity prices for the zone 4 region in downstate Illinois increased to $150 per MW per day
beginning in June 2015, an increase from the prior pricing of $16.75 per MW per day that was in effect from June 2014 to May 2015. Generation had an offer that was selected in the auction. However, due to Generation s ratable hedging
strategy, the results of the capacity auction have not had a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s consolidated results of operations and cash flows.   
  Additionally, in late May and June 2015, separate complaints were filed at the FERC by each of the State of Illinois, the
Southwest Electric Cooperative, Public Citizens, Inc. and the Illinois Industrial Energy   
         212

Table of Contents  

Consumers challenging the results of this MISO capacity auction for the 2015/2016 delivery in MISO delivery zone 4. The complaints alleged generally that 1) the results of the capacity
auction for zone 4 are not just and reasonable, 2) the results should be suspended, set for hearing and replaced with a new just and reasonable rate, 3) a refund date should be established and that 4) certain alleged behavior by one of the market
participants, other than Exelon or Generation, be investigated.      On October 1, 2015, the FERC announced that
it was conducting a non-public investigation (that does not involve Exelon or Generation) into whether market manipulation or other potential violations occurred related to the auction. On December 31, 2015, the FERC issued a decision that certain
of the rules governing the establishment of capacity prices in downstate Illinois are  not just and reasonable  on a prospective basis. The FERC ordered that certain rules must be changed for the next auction scheduled in April 2016 that
set capacity prices beginning June 1, 2016. In response to this order, MISO filed conforming rule changes with the FERC. The FERC continues to conduct its non-public investigation to determine if the April 2015 auction results were manipulated
and, if so, whether refunds are appropriate. The FERC did establish May 28, 2015, the day the first complaint was filed, as the date from which refunds (if ordered) would be calculated, and it also made clear that the findings in the December 31,
2015 order do not prejudge the investigation or related proceedings. On March 18, 2016, the FERC denied rehearing of its December 31, 2015 order in this matter. On April 14, 2016, the MISO released the results of the 2016/2017 capacity auction; the
zone 4 region in downstate Illinois cleared the auction at a rate of $72 per MW per day. Clinton nuclear plant, which operates in the zone 4 region, cleared the auction and is committed to operate through May 31, 2017. See Note 7   Early
Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impacts of the MISO announcement. On September 8, 2016, a coalition of MISO transmission customers filed a complaint
alleging that the MISO failed to follow its tariff in conducting the capacity auction and, as a result, overstated the clearing prices including in zone 4 where the transmission customers allege that the rate should have been $20 per MW per day.
Among other things, the transmission customers seek refunds of the alleged excess payment. It is too early in this proceeding to predict its outcome. Nonetheless, it could detrimentally impact the auction results for Clinton.   
  MISO has acknowledged the need for capacity market design changes in the zone 4 region and stated that reforms to its
capacity market process may be required to drive future investment and is engaging stakeholders to consider such reforms. The FERC has also encouraged such efforts, and Exelon has been working with MISO and its stakeholders on such market changes.
       Subsidized Generation  .    The rate of expansion of subsidized generation,
including low-carbon generation such as wind and solar energy, in the markets in which Generation s output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power prices, and in turn, Generation s results of operations.   
  Various states have attempted to implement or propose legislation, regulations or other policies to inappropriately
subsidize new generation development and existing generation which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity prices.      For example, Exelon and others challenged the constitutionality and other aspects of New Jersey legislation aimed at suppressing capacity market prices in federal court. See Note 5   Regulatory
Matters to the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on state specific actions taken in Maryland and New Jersey. Similar actions taken by the MDPSC were also challenged in federal court in an action to which
Exelon was not a party. The federal trial courts in both the New Jersey and Maryland actions effectively invalidated the actions taken by the New Jersey legislature and the MDPSC, respectively. Those decisions were upheld by the U.S. Court of
Appeals. On April 19, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Fourth Circuit decision holding that the MDPSC s required contracts are illegal and unenforceable. On April 25, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari
concerning the Third Circuit decision. This denial of certiorari leaves the Third Circuit decision in place, with the same outcome as the Fourth Circuit decision.   
         213

   Nonetheless, Exelon believes that these projects may have already
artificially suppressed capacity prices in PJM in these auctions. While the Supreme Court decision is a positive development, continuation of inappropriate state efforts, if successful and unabated in future capacity auctions, could continue to
result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and/or energy prices. Other states could seek to establish similar programs, which could substantially impact Exelon s market driven position and could have a significant effect on
Exelon s financial results of operations, financial position and cash flows.      One such state is Ohio,
where state-regulated utility companies FirstEnergy Ohio (FE) and AEP Ohio (AEP) initiated actions at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to obtain approval for Riders that effectively allow these two companies to pass through to all
customers in their service territories the differences between their costs and market revenues on PPAs entered into between the utility and its merchant generation affiliate. Collectively more than 6,000MW of primarily coal-fired generation
owned by FE and AEP s affiliates sought ratepayer guaranteed subsidies via the proposed Riders. While AEP and FE initially filed for approval of these Riders in 2013 and 2014, respectively, it was not until late 2015 that the proposals obtained
meaningful traction when PUCO staff entered into a settlement and stipulation with the Ohio utilities supporting the proposals and recommending that the PUCO approve the Riders. On March 31, 2016, PUCO issued separate orders generally approving
each of the FE and AEP arrangements. In addition, separate complaints were filed at the FERC pursuing federal causes of action (i) seeking to impose affiliate self-dealing requirements on the PPAs and (ii) seeking to impose a MOPR on the resources
supporting the PPAs. On April 27, 2016, the FERC issued orders on the affiliate matter rescinding certain affiliate waivers previously granted to AEP and FE and requiring each to demonstrate that the PPAs (prior to transacting under them) were
entered into on an arms-length basis and do not reflect any affiliate preference. As a result, we do not believe that the PPAs impacted the results of PJM s recently completed capacity auctions. Nonetheless, further action by AEP and FE
related to the PPAs is possible. Indeed, FE recently filed a restructured arrangement at PUCO that appears to achieve a similar result without relying on a PPA. In addition, the outcome of the MOPR complaint and its impact, if any, on
Generation is not yet clear as it is too early in the proceeding to predict its outcome. Finally, Dayton Power and Light filed at PUCO seeking approval of similar arrangements.   
  Exelon continues to monitor developments in Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, New England and other states and participates in
stakeholder and other processes to ensure that only appropriate state subsidies are developed. Exelon remains active in advocating for competitive markets, while opposing policies that require taxpayers and/ or consumers to subsidize or give
preferential treatment to generation providers or technologies that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefits, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid.   
    Energy Demand.      Modest economic growth partially offset by energy efficiency
initiatives is resulting in positive growth for electricity for Pepco, a decrease in projected load for electricity for BGE, DPL and ACE, and an essentially flat projected load for electricity for ComEd and PECO. ComEd, PECO,BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE
are projecting load volumes to increase (decrease) by 0.4%, 0.0%, (1.4)%, 1.0%, (1.7)% and (1.6)%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.        Retail Competition.      Generation s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that Generation can earn and the
volumes that it is able to serve. We expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including Generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.
      Strategic Policy Alignment       Exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy, dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity
position, by performing various stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades.

   Exelon s Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2016 dividends
of $0.31 per share each on Exelon s common stock. The first quarter 2016 dividend was paid on March 10, 2016.      Exelon s Board of Directors declared the second quarter 2016 dividends of $0.318 per share each on Exelon s common stock. The second quarter 2016 dividend was paid on June 10, 2016. The
dividend increased from the first quarter amount to reflect the Board s decision to raise Exelon s dividend 2.5% each year for the next three years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend.   
  Exelon s Board of Directors declared the third quarter 2016 dividends of $0.318 per share each on Exelon s
common stock. The third quarter 2016 dividend was paid on September 9, 2016.      Exelon s Board of Directors
declared the fourth quarter 2016 dividends of $0.318 per share each on Exelon s common stock. The fourth quarter 2016 dividend is payable on December 9, 2016.   
  All future quarterly dividends require approval by Exelon s Board of Directors.   
   Hedging Strategy       Exelon s policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk
associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. Generation enters into non-derivative and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward
contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. Generation has hedges in place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2016 and 2017. However, Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price
risk in the subsequent years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently unhedged. As of September 30, 2016, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments is 98%-101%,
85%-88% and 54%-57% for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our
commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following
products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, such as wholesale and retail sales of power, options and swaps. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price
risk in subsequent years as well.      Generation procures oil and natural gas through long-term and short-term
contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel
fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services, coal, oil and natural gas are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s
procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 57% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements
from 2016 through 2020 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared
to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.   
  The Utility Registrants mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover
procurement costs from retail customers.

    Growth Opportunities    
  Management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon s businesses, assets and markets,
leveraging Exelon s expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns.        Regulated Energy
Businesses.      The completed merger with PHI provides an opportunity to accelerate Exelon s regulated growth to provide stable cash flows, earnings accretion, and dividend support. Additionally, the Utility
Registrants anticipate investing approximately $25 billion over the next five years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart meter and smart grid initiatives, storm hardening, advanced
reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately $9 billion by the end of 2020. The Utility Registrants invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and
the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. These investments are made prudently and at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.   
  See Note 5   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the Smart Meter and Smart Grid Initiatives and infrastructure development and enhancement programs.        Competitive Energy Businesses   .     Generation continually assesses the optimal structure and composition of our generation assets as well as explores wholesale and
retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors. Generation s long-term growth strategy is to prioritize investments in long-term contracted generation across multiple technologies and identify and capitalize on opportunities that
provide generation to load matching as a means to provide stable earnings, while identifying emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future growth or influence in market development. As of
September 30, 2016, Generation has currently approved plans to invest a total of approximately $2 billion in 2016 through 2018 on capital growth projects (primarily new plant construction and distributed generation).   
   Liquidity    
  Each of the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on
maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and OPEB obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. A broad spectrum of financing alternatives
beyond the core financing options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners,
etc.). The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.      The Registrants have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9.0 billion. Generation also has bilateral credit facilities with aggregate maximum availability of
$525 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources   Credit Matters   Exelon Credit Facilities below.   
    Exposure to Worldwide Financial Markets.      Exelon has exposure to worldwide financial
markets including European banks. Disruptions in the European markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants  ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 23%, or
$2.2 billion, of the Registrants  aggregate total commitments were with European banks. The credit facilities include $9.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.9 billion was available as of September 30, 2016, due to
outstanding letters of credit. There was $40 million of borrowings under the Registrants  bilateral credit facilities as of September 30, 2016. See Liquidity and Capital Resources   Credit Matters   Exelon Credit Facilities

  Exelon is actively involved in the EPA s development and implementation of environmental regulations for the electric
industry, in pursuit of its business strategy to provide reliable, clean, affordable and innovative energy products. These efforts have most frequently involved air, water and waste controls for electric generating units, as set forth in the
discussion below. These regulations have a disproportionate adverse impact on fossil-fuel power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance expense, and have resulted in the retirement of older,
marginal facilities. Retirements of coal-fired power plants are expected to continue as additional EPA regulations take effect, and as air quality standards are updated and further restrict emissions. Due to its low emission generation portfolio,
Generation will not be significantly directly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. Various bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress
that would prohibit or impede the EPA s rulemaking efforts, and it is uncertain whether any of these bills will become law.        Air Quality.      In recent years, the EPA has been implementing a series of increasingly stringent regulations under the Clean Air Act applicable to electric generating
units. These regulations have resulted in more stringent emissions limits on fossil-fuel electric generating stations as states implement their compliance plans.   
   National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).     The EPA continues to review and update its
NAAQS for conventional air pollutants relating to ground-level ozone and emissions of particulate matter, SO2 and NOx. Following five years of litigation, the EPA is finalizing the Cross State Air Pollution Rule that requires 28 upwind states in the
eastern half of the United States to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in downwind states.   
   Mercury and Air Toxics Standard Rule (MATS).     On December 16, 2011, the EPA signed a
final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the NSPS for electric generating units. The final rule, known as MATS, requires coal-fired electric generation plants to achieve high removal rates of
mercury, acid gases and other metals, and to make capital investments in pollution control equipment and incur higher operating expenses. The initial compliance deadline to meet the new standards was April 16, 2015; however, facilities may have been
granted an additional one or two year extension in limited cases. Numerous entities challenged MATS in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Exelon intervened in support of the rule. In April 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion upholding MATS in
its entirety. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in June 2015 that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. The
U.S. Supreme Court, however, did not vacate the rule; rather, it was remanded to the D.C. Circuit Court to take further action consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court s opinion on this single issue. As such, the MATS rule remains in effect.
Exelon will continue to participate in the remanded proceedings before the D.C. Circuit Court as an intervenor in support of the rule.       Climate Change.     Exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation or regulation, including a cap-and-trade program for GHG emissions, which balances the need to
protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national GHG emissions. In the absence of federal legislation, the EPA is moving forward with the regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In addition, there have
been recent developments in the international regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC  or  Convention ). On October 5, 2016, the Paris Climate Change
Agreement entered into effect, and the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties in November 2016 will address procedural issues as countries take action to meet their voluntary carbon emission reductions. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS,  Global
Climate Change  of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion.

     Water Quality.      Section 316(b) of
the Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of
Generation s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by changes to the existing
regulations. Those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Salem and Wolf Hollow. See ITEM
1. BUSINESS,  Water Quality  of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion.        Solid and
Hazardous Waste.      In October 2015, the first federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from power plants became effective. The rule classifies CCR as non-hazardous waste under RCRA. Under
the regulation, CCR will continue to be regulated by most states subject to coordination with the federal regulations. Generation has previously recorded reserves consistent with state regulation for its owned coal ash sites, and as such, the
regulation is not expected to impact Exelon s and Generation s financial results. Generation does not have sufficient information to reasonably assess the potential likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be
asserted under the new federal regulations for coal ash disposal sites formerly owned by Generation. For these reasons, Generation is unable to predict whether and to what extent it may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs
relating to formerly owned coal ash disposal sites under the new regulations.      See Note 18   Commitments
and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to environmental matters, including the impact of environmental regulation.       Other Regulatory and Legislative Actions         NRC Task
Force Insights from the Fukushima Daiichi Accident (Exelon and Generation).      In July 2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the March 11, 2011, 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami, that seriously
damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, issued a report of its review of the accident, including tiered recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. The Task
Force s report concluded that nuclear reactors in the United States are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. The NRC and its staff have issued orders and implementation guidance for commercial
reactor licensees operating in the United States. The NRC and its staff are continuing to evaluate additional requirements. Generation has assessed the impacts of the Tier 1 orders and information requests and will continue monitoring the additional
recommendations under review by the NRC staff, both from an operational and a financial impact standpoint. A comprehensive review of the NRC Tier 1 orders and information requests, as well as preliminary engineering assumptions and analysis,
indicate that the financial impact of compliance for Generation, net of expected co-owner reimbursements, for the period from 2016 through 2019 is expected to be between approximately $150 million and $175 million of capital (which includes
approximately $25 million for the CENG plants) and $25 million of operating expense (which includes approximately $5 million for the CENG plants). These revised amounts take into consideration the effect of the early plant retirements of Clinton and
Quad Cities (see Note 7 Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Generation s current assessments are specific to the Tier 1 recommendations as the NRC has not
finalized actions with respect to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations. Exelon and Generation are unable to conclude at this time to what extent any actions to comply with the requirements of Tier 2 and Tier 3 will impact their future financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows. Generation will continue to engage in nuclear industry assessments and actions and stakeholder input.        New York Clean Energy Standard (Exelon, Generation).          On August 1, 2016, the the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) issued an order establishing
the Clean Energy Standard (CES), a component of which includes creation of a Tier 3 Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of zero-emissions nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet the criteria
  
         218

demonstrating public necessity as determined by the NYPSC. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) will centrally procure the ZECs from eligible plants through
a 12-year contract, to be administered in six two-year tranches, extending from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2029. ZEC payments will be made to the eligible resources based upon the number of MWh produced, subject to specified caps and minimum
performance requirements. The price to be paid for the ZECs under each tranche will be administratively determined using a formula based on the social cost of carbon as determined by the federal government. The ZEC price for the first tranche has
been set at $17.48 per MWh of production. Following the first tranche, the price will be updated bi-annually. Each Load Serving Entity (LSE) shall be required to purchase an amount of ZECs equivalent to its load ratio share of the total electric
energy in the New York Control Area. Cost recovery from ratepayers shall be incorporated into the commodity charges on customer bills. The CES initially identifies the three plants eligible for the ZEC program to include, for now, the FitzPatrick,
Ginna, and Nine Mile Point nuclear facilities. The program specifically provides that Nine Mile Point Units 1   2 qualify jointly as a single facility and if either unit permanently ceases operations then both units will no longer qualify for
ZEC payments for the remainder of the program. As issued, the order provides that the duration of the program beyond the first tranche is conditional upon a buyer purchasing the FitzPatrick facility and taking title prior to September 1,
2018; however, Generation and CENG requested clarification, or in the alternative limited rehearing, that this condition is applicable to the FitzPatrick facility only and has no bearing on the 12-year duration of the program for Ginna or Nine
Mile Point. To date, several parties have filed with the NYPSC requests for rehearing or reconsideration of the CES and on October 19, 2016 a coalition of fossil generation companies filed a complaint in federal district court against the NYPSC
alleging that the ZEC program violates certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution; specifically that the ZEC program interferes with FERC s jurisdiction over wholesale rates and that it discriminates against out of state competitors.
Generation and CENG will seek to intervene in the case and to dismiss the lawsuit. Other legal challenges remain possible and the outcomes of each of these challenges is currently uncertain. Negotiations with NYSERDA regarding contracts for the
sale of ZECs from Ginna, Nine Mile Point and FitzPatrick are ongoing, and Generation expects that NYSERDA will enter into final agreements during the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note 7   Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relative to Ginna and Nine Mile Point and Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
on Generation s proposed acquisition of FitzPatrick.        Illinois Low Carbon Portfolio Standard
(Exelon, Generation and ComEd).      In March 2015, the Low Carbon Portfolio Standard (LCPS) was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly. The legislation would require ComEd and Ameren to purchase low carbon energy
credits to match 70 percent of the electricity used on the distribution system. The LCPS is a technology-neutral solution, so all generators of zero or low carbon energy would be able to compete in the procurement process, including wind, solar,
hydro, clean coal and nuclear. Costs associated with purchasing the low carbon energy credits would be collected from customers. The LCPS proposal includes consumer protections such as a price cap that would limit the impact to a 2.015%
increase based off 2009 monthly bills, or about $2 per month for the average residential electricity customer, similar to the cost cap protection under other clean energy programs in Illinois. The legislation also includes a separate customer
rebate provision that would provide a direct bill credit to customers in the event wholesale prices exceed a specified level. The proposed legislation remains pending along with two other major energy bills. Exelon and Generation continue to
work with stakeholders on a comprehensive energy package.        Legislation to Maximize Smart Grid
Investments and to Promote a Cleaner and Greener Illinois (Exelon and ComEd).              In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly that would (1) build on ComEd s
investment in the Smart Grid to reinforce the resiliency and security of the electrical grid to withstand unexpected challenges, (2) expand energy efficiency programs to reduce energy waste and increase customer savings, (3) further integrate clean
renewable energy onto the power system, and (4) introduce a new demand-based rate design for residential customers that would allow for a more equitable sharing of smart grid costs among customers. The legislation also provides for additional
funding for customer assistance programs for low-income customers. The proposed legislation is pending and ComEd continues to work with stakeholders.

     Next Generation Energy Plan (Exelon, Generation and
ComEd).      On May 5, 2016, the Next Generation Energy Plan was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly. The legislation contains significant parts of the previously introduced Illinois Low Carbon Portfolio Standard
and Legislation to Maximize Smart Grid Investments and to Promote a Cleaner and Greater Illinois, along with new elements. The legislation includes (1) a Zero Emission Standard providing compensation for at-risk nuclear plants that demonstrate their
revenues are insufficient to cover their costs, (2) $1 billion of funding for low-income assistance, including $650 million for energy efficiency programs, $250 million in Renewable Energy Resource Funds, $50 million in Percentage of Income Payment
Plan funding and utility bill assistance, and $50 million in ComEd CARE, (3) $140 million in new funding for solar development and a new solar rebate to incent solar generation, (4) additional investment at ComEd to enhance reliability and security
of the power grid, (5) an expansion of the Renewable Portfolio Standard, and (6) a 50% reduction in the fixed customer charge for energy delivery creating more equitable rates across customers. The proposed legislation is pending and Exelon,
Generation, and ComEd continue to work with stakeholders. See Note 7   Early Nuclear Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
    Distribution Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd).      On April 13, 2016, ComEd filed
its annual distribution formula rate with the ICC, requesting a total increase to the revenue requirement of $138 million, reflecting an increase of $139 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2017 and a decrease of $1 million related to
the annual reconciliation for 2015. The filing establishes the revenue requirement used to set the rates that will take effect in January 2017 after the ICC s review and approval, which is due by December 2016. See Note 5   Regulatory
Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to distribution formula updates.        2016 Maryland Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon, PHI and Pepco).          On April 19, 2016, Pepco filed an application with the MDPSC requesting an
increase of $127 million to its electric distribution base rates, which was later updated to $103 million, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. The application is inclusive of a request seeking recovery of Pepco s regulatory assets associated
with its AMI program over a five-year period supported by evidence demonstrating that the benefits of the AMI program exceed the costs on a present value basis. Any adjustments to rates approved by the MDPSC are expected to take effect in November
2016. In addition to the proposed rate increase, Pepco is proposing to continue its Grid Resiliency Program initially approved in July 2013 in connection with Pepco s electric distribution rate case filed in November 2012. Under the Grid
Resiliency Program, Pepco is authorized to receive recovery of specific investments as the assets are placed in service through the Grid Resiliency Charge. In connection with the Grid Resiliency Program, Pepco proposes to accelerate improvement to
priority feeders and install single-phase reclosing fuse technology by investing $16 million a year for two years for a total of $32 million. Pepco cannot predict how much of the requested rate increase the MDPSC will approve or if it will approve a
continuation of Pepco s Grid Resiliency Program proposal.        2016 Maryland Electric Distribution Base
Rates (Exelon, PHI and DPL).          On July 20, 2016, DPL filed an application with the MDPSC requesting an increase of $66 million to its electric distribution base rates, which was later updated to $57
million, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. The application is inclusive of a request seeking recovery of DPL s regulatory assets associated with its AMI program over a five-year period supported by evidence demonstrating that the benefits
of the AMI program exceed the costs on a present value basis. Any adjustments to rates approved by the MDPSC are expected to take effect in February 2017. DPL cannot predict how much of the requested increase the MDPSC will approve. In addition to
the proposed rate increase, DPL is proposing to continue its Grid Resiliency Program initially approved in September 2013 in connection with DPL s electric distribution rate case filed in February 2013. Under the Grid Resiliency Program, DPL is
authorized to receive recovery of specific investments as the assets are placed in service through the Grid Resiliency Charge. In connection with the Grid Resiliency Program, DPL proposes to accelerate improvement to priority feeders and install
single-phase reclosing fuse technology by investing $4.6 million a year for two years for a total of $9.2 million. DPL cannot predict whether the MDPSC will approve a continuation of DPL s Grid Resiliency Program proposal.

     2016 Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and
DPL).      On May 17, 2016, DPL filed an application with the DPSC to increase its annual electric and natural gas distribution base rates by $63 million and $22 million, respectively, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%.
While the DPSC is not required to issue a decision on the application within a specified period of time, Delaware law allows DPL to put into effect $2.5 million of the rate increase two months after filing the applications which were effective July
16, 2016. It also allows the entire requested rate increase seven months after filing, subject to a cap and a refund obligation based on the final DPSC order. DPL cannot predict how much of the requested increase the DPSC will approve.   
    2015 Maryland Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).      On
November 6, 2015, and as amended through the course of the proceeding, BGE filed for electric and natural gas base rate increases with the MDPSC, ultimately requesting annual increases of $116 million and $78 million respectively, of which $104
million and $37 million, were related to recovery of electric and natural gas smart grid initiative costs, respectively. BGE also proposed to recover an annual increase of approximately $30 million for Baltimore City underground conduit fees through
a surcharge.     On June 3, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order in which the MDPSC found compelling evidence to
conclude that BGE s smart grid initiative overall was cost beneficial to customers. However, the June 3 order contained several cost disallowances and adjustments, including not allowing BGE to defer or recover through a surcharge the $30
million increase in annual Baltimore City underground conduit fees. On June 30, 2016, BGE filed a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order requesting that the MDPSC modify its order to reverse certain decisions including the decision
associated with the Baltimore City underground conduit fees. OPC also subsequently filed for a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order.      On July 29, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order on the petitions for rehearing that reversed certain of its prior cost disallowances and adjustments related to the smart grid initiative. Through the
combination of the orders, the MDPSC authorized electric and natural gas rate increases of $44 million and $48 million, respectively, and an allowed ROE for the electric and natural gas distribution businesses of 9.75% and 9.65%, respectively. The
new electric and natural gas base rates took effect for service rendered on or after June 4, 2016. However, MDPSC s July 29 order on the petition on rehearing still did not allow BGE to defer or recover through a surcharge the
increase in Baltimore City underground conduit fees.      On August 26, 2016, BGE filed an appeal of the
MDPSC s orders with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August 29, 2016, the residential consumer advocate also filed an appeal of the MDPSC s order but with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Refer to the Conduit Lease with City
of Baltimore disclosure below for further details about BGE s efforts to protect its customers from any improper use by the City of the conduit fee revenues and to place constraints on the City s ability to set the conduit fee in the
future. Refer to Note 5 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the impact of the ultimate disallowances contained in the orders to BGE.   
    2016 Electric Distribution Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and Pepco).          On June
30, 2016, Pepco filed an application with the DCPSC to increase its annual electric distribution base rates by $86 million, which was updated to $82 million on October 14, 2016, based on a requested ROE of 10.6%. The DCPSC has issued a
procedural schedule indicating a final decision will be issued by July 25, 2017. Any adjustments to its rates approved by the DCPSC are expected to take effect soon thereafter. Pepco cannot predict how much of the requested increase the DCPSC will
approve.      On April 18, 2016, a party to a separate DCPSC proceeding filed a motion to suspend Pepco s
bill stabilization adjustment (BSA), which decouples distribution revenues from utility customers from the amount of electricity delivered. On September 9, 2016, the DCPSC denied the party s motion and determined that the appropriate forum in
which to determine whether the BSA continues to be just and reasonable is in Pepco s rate case proceeding. In addition, the DCPSC stated that it was putting Pepco on notice that all funds collected for the BSA from January 2015 to the issuance
of a decision in the rate case proceeding are subject to refund should the   
         221

Table of Contents  

DCPSC determine that such funds were not justly or reasonably collected. On October 7, 2016, Pepco filed for reconsideration of this order and requested clarification that the order was not final
and that the BSA matter would be decided in the base rate case. Pepco also argued that, if the order were considered final, the DCPSC reconsider its ruling that funds collected from the BSA can be retroactively refunded. Pepco cannot predict the
outcome of this matter or the impact of a refund if ordered by the DCPSC.        2016 Electric Distribution
Base Rates (Exelon, PHI and ACE).      On August 24, 2016, the NJBPU issued an order approving a stipulation of settlement among ACE, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, NJBPU Staff and Unimin Corporation, and an
increase of $45 million (before New Jersey sales and use tax) to its electric distribution base rates, with the new rates effective immediately. The stipulation of settlement provided that a determination on PowerAhead would be separated into a
phase II of the rate proceeding and decided at a later date and the parties would seek to resolve the matter by the end of 2016, although resolution will most likely occur in the first quarter of 2017. PowerAhead includes capital investments to
advance modernization of the electric grid through energy efficiency, increased distributed generation, and resiliency, focused on improving the distribution system s ability to withstand major storm events. ACE cannot predict if the NJBPU will
approve the PowerAhead initiative.        Update and Reconciliation of Certain Under-Recovered Balances
(Exelon, PHI and ACE).           O n February 1, 2016, ACE submitted its 2016 annual petition with the NJBPU seeking to reconcile and update (i) charges related to the recovery of above-market costs
associated with ACE s long-term power purchase contracts with the NUGs and (ii) costs related to surcharges for the New Jersey Societal Benefit Program (a statewide public interest program that is intended to benefit low income customers
and address other public policy goals) and ACE s uncollectible accounts.      The net impact of adjusting the
charges as proposed is an overall annual rate increase of $9 million (revised to $19 million in April 2016, based upon an update for actuals through March 2016), including New Jersey sales and use tax. The matter is pending at the NJBPU.
       Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and
ACE).          The following total increases/(decreases) were included in ComEd s, BGE s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s electric transmission formula rate filings:

    As part of the FERC-approved settlement of ComEd s 2007 transmission rate case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.50% and the common
equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the transmission formula rate is currently capped at 55%. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of the ROE complaint against BGE, Pepco, DPL and
ACE, the rate of return on common equity is 10.50%, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive adder for being a member of a regional transmission organization.      
    Conduit Lease with City of Baltimore (Exelon and BGE)  .    On September 23, 2015, the

system effective November 1, 2015, which is expected to result in an increase to Operating and maintenance expense of approximately $25 million in 2016 subject to an annual increase based on the
Consumer Price Index. On October 16, 2015, BGE filed a lawsuit against the City in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to protect its customers from any improper use by the City of the conduit fee revenues and to place constraints on the
City s ability to set the conduit fee in the future.      Among the relief sought by BGE was a preliminary
injunction preventing the City from enforcing its substantial increase in the conduit fee rate during the course of the litigation. A hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on December 15, 2015. While BGE s motion for
preliminary injunction was denied, the Court s decision was premised upon several important concessions or acknowledgments made by the City in its written papers and at the hearing. Most importantly, the City conceded that it can charge BGE
only for the actual costs of conduit maintenance and that a true-up process is required to the extent that the City fails to spend the amount collected for conduit maintenance. On July 12-13, 2016, the parties participated in non-binding
mediation in an effort to resolve their disputes, but such mediation was unsuccessful. Due to concerns with the scheduling order entered by the Circuit Court, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the lawsuit; however, BGE has the right to
re-file the lawsuit. On August 25, 2016, BGE filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit filed by several other tenants in the conduit system against the City in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. BGE cannot predict the
outcome of its motion for intervention or the accompanying complaint.      As part of its electric and gas
distribution rate case filed on November 6, 2015, and as amended in the first quarter of 2016, BGE proposed to recover the annual increase in conduit fees effective November 1, 2015 of approximately $30 million through a surcharge. On June 3, 2016,
the MDPSC issued a final order which did not allow BGE to recover or defer the $30 million in annual Baltimore City conduit fees. On June 30, 2016, BGE filed a petition for rehearing of the June 3 order requesting, among other things, that the
MDPSC modify its decision to deny recovery of the Baltimore County conduit fees. On July 29, 2016, the MDPSC issued an order on the petitions for rehearing that, among other things, denied BGE s request that it be allowed to defer or
recover through a surcharge the increase in Baltimore City underground conduit fees. On August 26, 2016, BGE filed an appeal of the MDPSC s orders with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August 29, 2016, the residential consumer
advocate also filed an appeal of the MDPSC s order but with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. BGE cannot predict the outcome of these appeals.       Employees       During the second and third quarters of 2016,
Exelon BSC and ComEd extended the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with IBEW Local 15 by three years; with an expiration date of September 30, 2022. Exelon Generation extended its CBA with both the IBEW Local 15 (covering the five (5)
Midwest nuclear plants) and IBEW Local 51 (Clinton) by three years; with expiration dates of April 30, 2022 and December 15, 2023, respectively. Additionally, Exelon Nuclear Security successfully ratified its CBA with the UGSOA Local 17 at
Oyster Creek to an extension of five (5) years, and Exelon Power successfully ratified its CBA with the IBEW Local 614 to a three (3) extension.

     Results of Operations   Generation     

(a)  
    Generation evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation believes that
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under
GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.           Net Income Attributable to Membership Interest     
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,
2015.     Generation s net income attributable to membership interest for three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expense,
higher depreciation and amortization expense and increased income tax expense, partially offset by higher revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense and increased other income. The increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily
related to impairment of Upstream assets and increased costs related to the cost management program. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to accelerated depreciation and amortization expense related to the
decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization and increased depreciation expense due to ongoing capital expenditures. The increase in income taxes given a decrease

deduction and absence of favorable settlement of certain income tax positions at Constellation in 2015. The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense primarily relates to higher
mark-to-market results in 2016 compared to 2015 and the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement partially offset by decreased capacity prices and lower realized energy prices. The increase in other income is primarily due to the change in
realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds.       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.     Generation s net income attributable to membership interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, higher operating and maintenance expense and higher depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by increased other income. The decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense
primarily relates to lower mark-to-market results in 2016 compared to 2015, lower realized energy prices and increased oil inventory write-downs, partially offset by the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement, decreased fuel prices and a
decrease in outage days at higher capacity units despite an increase in overall outage days. The increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily related to the decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating
facilities, impairment of Upstream assets and certain wind projects and increased costs related to the cost management program. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to accelerated depreciation and amortization
expense related to the decision to early retire the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear generating facilities, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization and increased depreciation expense due to ongoing capital expenditures. The increase in other
income is primarily due to the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds.        Revenue Net of Purchased Power and Fuel
Expense        The basis for Generation s reportable segments is the integrated management of its
electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels

    Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor    
  The following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the same periods in 2015, for the Generation-operated plants. The nuclear fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated
at full average annual mean capacity for that time period. Generation considers capacity factor to be a useful measure to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. Generation has included the analysis below as a complement to the
financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere

     Results of Operations   ComEd     

(a)  
    ComEd evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Revenue net of purchased power expense. ComEd believes that Revenue net of purchased
power expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. In general, ComEd only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. ComEd has included its
discussion of Revenue net of purchased power expense below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be
comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.      

(b)  
    For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd s electric distribution and transmission formula rates, and riders, revenues increase and
decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings).      
    Net Income         Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three months ended September 30, 2015.     ComEd s Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than
the same period in 2015, primarily due to the recognition of the penalty and the after-tax interest due on the asserted penalty related to the Tax Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, partially offset by increased
electric distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed electric distribution ROE) and favorable weather.   
   Nine months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine months ended September 30,
2015.     ComEd s Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the same period in 2015, primarily due to the recognition of the penalty and the after-tax interest due on the asserted penalty
related to the Tax Court s decision on Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, partially offset by increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment, partially
offset by lower allowed electric distribution ROE) and favorable weather.

     Operating Revenue Net of Purchased Power Expense     
  There are certain drivers of Operating revenue that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power expense, such as
commodity procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. ComEd is permitted to recover electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations in electricity procurement costs have no impact on
Revenue net of purchased power expense. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on ComEd s electricity procurement process.   
  All ComEd customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. Customer
choice programs do not impact ComEd s volume of deliveries, but do affect ComEd s Operating revenue related to supplied energy, which is fully offset in Purchased power expense. Therefore, customer choice programs have no impact on Revenue
net of purchased power expense.      Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers
(as a percentage of kWh sales) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:       
    Retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation
suppliers at September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:       
    Under an Illinois law allowing municipalities to arrange the purchase of electricity for
their participating residents, the City of Chicago previously participated in ComEd s customer choice program and arranged the purchase of electricity from Constellation (formerly Integrys), for those participating residents. In September
2015, the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and many of those participating residents resumed their purchase of electricity from ComEd. ComEd s Operating revenue has increased as a result of the City
of Chicago switching, but that increase is fully offset in Purchased power expense.      The changes in
ComEd s Revenue net of purchased power expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015 consisted of the following:

    Weather.     The demand for electricity is
affected by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage. Conversely,
mild weather reduces demand. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, favorable weather conditions increased Operating revenue net of purchased power expense when compared to the same periods in 2015.   
  Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home
or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in ComEd s service territory with cooling degree days generally having a more significant impact to ComEd, particularly
during the summer months. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in ComEd s service territory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:   
   
     Volume.     For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, Revenue net of purchased power expense increased as a result of higher delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, reflecting increased average usage per residential customer as compared to the same periods in 2015.   
   Electric Distribution Revenue.     EIMA provides for a performance-based formula rate tariff,
which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Under EIMA, electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based
upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, and allowed ROE. ComEd s allowed ROE is the annual average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points, subject to a collar of plus or minus 50 basis points.
Therefore, the collar limits favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and load on revenue. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, ComEd recorded increased electric distribution revenue primarily due to increased capital
investment and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower allowed ROE due to a decrease in treasury rates. See Depreciation and amortization expense discussions below, and Note 5   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.       Transmission Revenue.     Under a
FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in January based on the prior calendar year.
Generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, ComEd recorded increased transmission revenue due to increased capital
investment, higher depreciation expense and increased highest daily peak load as compared to the same period in 2015.       Regulatory Required Programs.     This represents the change in Operating revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as
ComEd s energy efficiency and demand response and purchased power administrative costs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. An equal and offsetting amount has been included in Operating and maintenance expense.

      Pricing and Customer Mix.     For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, the decrease in Revenue net of purchased power as a result of pricing and customer mix is primarily attributable to lower overall effective rates due to increased usage across all major customer classes and change in customer mix as compared
to the same period in 2015.       Other.     Other revenue, which can vary period to
period, includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, assistance provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs, recoveries of environmental costs associated with MGP sites, and recoveries of energy procurement
costs.        Operating and Maintenance Expense         

(a)  
    Operating and maintenance expense for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable
from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in Operating revenue.      
  The changes in Operating and maintenance expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the same periods in 2015, consisted of the following:

    Primarily reflects increased information technology support services from BSC during 2016.      
    Depreciation and Amortization Expense        The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, consisted of the following:   

(a)  
    Depreciation expense increased due to ongoing capital expenditures.           Taxes Other Than Income        Taxes other than income,
which can vary period to period, include municipal and state utility taxes, real estate taxes and payroll taxes. Taxes other than income taxes remained relatively consistent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
the same periods in 2015.        Gain on Sales of Assets     
  The increase in Gain on sales of assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the

          Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder     
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,
2015.     PECO s Net income attributable to common shareholder increased from the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of increased electric
distribution revenue pursuant to the 2015 PAPUC authorized electric distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2016, as well as favorable summer weather.       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.     PECO s Net income attributable to common shareholder increased from the same
period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of increased electric distribution revenue pursuant to the 2015 PAPUC authorized electric distribution rate increase effective January 1,
2016, partially offset by unfavorable winter weather as well as a lower income tax expense as a result of an increase in the gas repairs deduction and a cumulative adjustment related to an anticipated gas repairs tax return accounting method change.
       Operating Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense     
  Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity
procurement costs. PECO s electric supply and natural gas cost rates charged to customers are subject to adjustments at least quarterly that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of electric supply and natural
gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the PAPUC s GSA and PGC, respectively. Therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchased
power and fuel expense.      Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also
affected by fluctuations in participation in the Customer Choice Program. All PECO customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. The customers 
choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. Customer choice program activity has no impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of
purchased power and fuel expense.      Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and
natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:   
   
    Retail customers purchasing electric generation and natural gas from competitive electric

   The changes in PECO s operating revenues net of purchased power and
fuel expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 consisted of the following:       
     Weather.     The demand for electricity and natural gas is
affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather
conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, Operating
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was higher due to the impact of favorable weather conditions in PECO s service territory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, Operating revenue net
of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in PECO s service territory.      Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and
cooling degree days for a 30-year period in PECO s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in PECO s service territory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in
2015 and normal weather consisted of the following:       
     Volume.     Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel
expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, remained relatively consistent. The increase in Operating revenue net of purchased power and
fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily reflects a shift in the volume profile across classes from lower priced
classes to higher priced classes for electric, as well as the impact of moderate economic and customer growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages for electric and natural gas.   
   Pricing.     The increase in Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a
result of pricing for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily reflects an increase in electric distribution rates charged to customers. The increase in electric distribution rates was
effective January 1, 2016 in accordance with the 2015 PAPUC approved electric distribution rate case settlement. See Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K for further

    Regulatory Required Programs.     This represents
the change in Operating revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as smart meter, energy efficiency and the GSA. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a
return. The costs of these programs are included in Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense and Income taxes. The decrease in revenue from regulatory required programs for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 is primarily the result of smart meter costs reflected in base rates in 2016 in accordance with the 2015 PAPUC approved electric distribution rate case settlement effective January 1, 2016
versus through a rider mechanism in 2015. Refer to the Operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.       Other.

Income Attributable to Common Shareholder         Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015 .    BGE s Net income attributable to common shareholder for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was higher than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in Revenue net
of purchased power and fuel, primarily as a result of an increase in transmission formula rate revenues, and higher electric and natural gas revenues as a result of the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in June 2016 and July 2016. The
increase in Revenue net of purchased power and fuel was partially offset by an increase in Depreciation and amortization expense due to the initiation of cost recovery of the AMI programs under the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in
June 2016 and July 2016.       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30,

reducing certain regulatory assets and other long-lived assets stemming from certain cost disallowances contained within the final smart grid rate order issued by the MDPSC in June 2016 and
increased storm costs. The lower net income was also due to an increase in Depreciation and amortization expense due to the initiation of cost recovery of the AMI programs under the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in June 2016 and July
2016. These increases in Operating and maintenance expense and Depreciation and amortization expense were partially offset by an increase in Revenue net of purchased power and fuel, primarily as a result of an increase in transmission formula rate
revenues, higher electric and natural gas revenues as a result of the distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC in June 2016 and July 2016, and lower income tax expense driven by lower taxable income.   
    Operating Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense     
  There are certain drivers to Operating revenue that are offset by their impact on Purchased power and fuel expense, such
as commodity procurement costs and programs allowing customers to select a competitive electric generation or natural gas supplier. Operating revenue and Purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs.
BGE s electric and natural gas rates charged to customers are subject to periodic adjustments that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased electric power and purchased natural gas and the amount
included in rates in accordance with the MDPSC s market-based SOS and gas commodity programs, respectively.      Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in the number of customers electing to use a competitive electric generation or natural gas
supplier. All BGE customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. The customers  choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but
does affect revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service.      Retail
deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:

   The changes in BGE s operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, consisted of the following:       
     Distribution Rate Increase.     The increase in distribution
revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to the impact of the new electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in June
2016 and July 2016 in accordance with the MDPSC approved electric and natural gas distribution rate case orders. See Note 5   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
   Revenue Decoupling.     The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather and
usage conditions. The MDPSC allows BGE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas distribution revenue from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of large industrial electric customers, and all
firm service natural gas customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on BGE s electric and natural gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenue per
customer, by customer class, regardless of changes in actual consumption levels. This allows BGE to recognize revenue at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what BGE s actual distribution volumes were for a billing period.
Therefore, while this revenue is affected by customer growth (i.e., increase in the number of customers), it will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions (i.e., changes in consumption per customer). BGE bills or credits customers in
subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings.      Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and
cooling degree days for a 30-year period in BGE s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in BGE s service territory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015
consisted of the following:       
     Regulatory Required Programs.     This represents the change in
revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the energy efficiency and demand response programs. The riders are designed to provide full recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs are
included in Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense and Taxes other than income in BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

    PHI evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense for electric and natural gas sales. PHI
believes revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. PHI has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial
information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP
information provided elsewhere in this report.           Successor Period Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
       PHI s net income attributable to common shareholders for the Successor period of three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $166 million. There were no significant changes in the underlying trends affecting

PHI s operations during the Successor period of three months ended September 30, 2016 except for the pre-tax recording of a $50 million reduction of merger-related commitments within
Operating and maintenance expense reflecting a reallocation of the most favored nation commitments among Exelon and Pepco, DPL and ACE, such that more commitments are expected to be obligations of Exelon for energy efficiency, workforce development
and other programs as opposed to obligations of Pepco, DPL and ACE for additional customer rate credits.        Successor Period Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Predecessor Period Three Months Ended September 30, 2015          Net Income Attributable to
Common Shareholders        PHI s net income attributable to common shareholders was $166 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $91 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       Operating Revenue Net of
Purchased Power and Fuel Expense        Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a
non-GAAP measure discussed above, increased by $54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is attributable to the following factors:   

Increase of $30 million at Pepco primarily related to electric distribution revenue increases totaling $9 million due to customer growth, $18
million in required regulatory programs primarily due to an EmPower Maryland rate increase effective February 2015, and $3 million higher transmission revenue due to a higher rate effective June 1, 2015 and due to the establishment of reserves
recorded in September 2015 related to the FERC ROE challenges, partially offset by lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery period ending March 2016;      

Increase of $18 million at DPL primarily related to electric distribution revenue increases totaling $7 million due to customer growth and higher
weather-related sales, an increase of $6 million due to an EmPower Maryland rate increase effective February 2015, and $5 million higher transmission revenue due to a higher rate effective June 1, 2015 and due to the establishment of a reserve
recorded in September 2015 related to the FERC ROE challenges, partially offset by lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery period ending March 2016;      

Increase of $28 million at ACE primarily related to electric distribution revenue increases totaling $17 million due to higher average customer
usage and a rate increase effective August 2016 and $11 million higher transmission revenue due to a higher rate effective June 1, 2015 and due to the establishment of a reserve recorded in September 2015 related to the FERC ROE challenges;

Increase of $13 million due to the effects of a decrease in ACE s BGS unbilled revenue resulting from lower average customer usage in the third
quarter 2015;          

Increase of $11 million at Corporate primarily due to BSC inter-company transactions; and      
   
      Operating and Maintenance Expense     
  Operating and maintenance expense decreased by $61 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is attributable to the following factors:       

Decrease of $27 million at Pepco, DPL and ACE primarily due to a $50 million reduction of merger-related commitments reflecting a reallocation of
the most favored nation commitments among Exelon and Pepco, DPL and ACE, such that more commitments are expected to be obligations of Exelon for      
         254

energy efficiency, workforce development and other programs as opposed to obligations of Pepco, DPL and ACE for additional customer rate credits, partially offset by $13 million of higher BSC and
PHISCO allocations, $4 million of charges resulting from a remeasurement of AMI-related regulatory assets and $3 million of higher storm costs;          

Increase of $12 million at Corporate primarily due to BSC inter-company and purchase accounting transactions; and      
   
      Depreciation and Amortization Expense     
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $16 million primarily due to $8 million higher amortization of
regulatory assets due to an EmPower Maryland surcharge rate increase effective February 2015, partially offset by lower amortization of MAPP abandonment costs, and higher depreciation of $6 million due to ongoing capital expenditures at Pepco, DPL,
and ACE.        Taxes Other Than Income        Taxes other than income increased by $4 million primarily due to higher utility taxes that are collected and passed through by Pepco and DPL.        Interest Expense, Net        Interest expense decreased by
$7 million primarily due to purchase accounting entries related to the fair value of long-term debt.        Other, Net     
  Other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $8 million due to $15 million of income recorded in
September 2015 from a change in the fair value of the derivative related to preferred stock, partially offset by higher AFUDC income in 2016.   
    Effective Income Tax Rate        PHI s effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 29.1% and 35.0%, respectively. See Note 11   Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.        Successor Period March 24,
2016 to September 30, 2016        PHI s net loss attributable to common shareholders for the Successor

(a)  
    Pepco evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales. Pepco believes revenue net
of purchased power expense is a useful measurement because it provides information      
         256

that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Pepco has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net
of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.      
    Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder         Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.     Pepco s net income attributable to common shareholder for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, was higher than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in revenue net of purchased power expense resulting from customer growth and and due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expense reflecting a revision
in the estimate of Pepco s merger commitment costs associated with the most favored nation provision of the merger orders. The revision in estimate included a reduction in Pepco s merger commitment costs of $13 million, reflecting a
reallocation of the most favored nation commitments among Exelon and Pepco, such that more commitments are expected to be obligations of Exelon for energy efficiency and other programs as opposed to obligations of Pepco for additional customer rate
credits.       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015.     Pepco s net income attributable to common shareholder for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was lower than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expense due
to merger-related costs.        Operating Revenue Net of Purchased Power Expense     
  Operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to Pepco s customers within its
service territories at regulated rates. Operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC-approved
formula methodology.      Electric revenues and purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in
participation in the Customer Choice Program. All Pepco customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. The customers  choice of supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects
revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy service.      Retail deliveries purchased from
competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kWh sales) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, consisted of the following:   
   
    Retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation
suppliers at September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:       
    Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented
71% and 72% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to the District of Columbia customers and 58% and 59% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to   
         257

Table of Contents  

Maryland customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 71% and 70% of Pepco s retail kWh sales to the District of Columbia customers and 61% and 59% of
Pepco s retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  The costs related to default electricity supply are included in Purchased power expense. Operating revenues also include
transmission enhancement credits that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM in consideration for approved regional transmission expansion plan expenditures.   
  Operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is
generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.   
  Purchased power expense consists of the cost of electricity purchased by Pepco to fulfill its default electricity supply
obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders.      The changes in Pepco s operating revenues net of purchased power expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 consisted of the following:
      
     Revenue Decoupling.     Pepco s results historically have
been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. For retail customers of Pepco in Maryland and in the District of Columbia, revenues are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder
weather because a bill stabilization adjustment (BSA) for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer. The BSA has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period
from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a result, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from customers in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of
customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. Changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution
revenue for customers to whom the BSA applies.      In accounting for the BSA in Maryland and the District of
Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and the District of Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco is
entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved
distribution charge per customer.

   Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the
demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in Pepco s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree
days in Pepco s service territory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 and normal weather consisted of the following:   
   
     Volume.     The increase in operating revenue net of purchased
power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily reflects the impact of economic and customer growth.
      Regulatory Required Programs.     This represents the change in operating revenues
collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs of these programs are included in
operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.   
   Transmission Revenue.       Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies
from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. The increase in revenue net of purchased power expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the same periods in 2015 is a result of higher rates effective June 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses and due to the establishment of a reserve recorded in September 2015 related to the FERC ROE
challenges, partially offset by lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery period that ended in March 2016.        Operating and
Maintenance Expense         

(a)  
    Operating and maintenance expenses for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are
recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in Operating revenues.

the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily due to higher utility taxes that are collected and passed through by Pepco. Taxes other than income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the same period in 2015 decreased primarily due to lower property taxes in Maryland partially offset by higher utility taxes that are collected and passed through by Pepco.        Gain on Sale of Assets        Gain on sale of assets for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased due to a second quarter 2016 gain recorded from the sale of land.

     Interest Expense, Net     
  Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased $6

       Other, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in
2015 increased primarily due to higher income from AFUDC.        Effective Income Tax Rate     
  Pepco s effective income tax rate was 30.7% and 34.8% for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Pepco s effective income tax rate was 63.0% and 32.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 11   Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates. As a result of the merger, Pepco recorded an after-tax charge of $30 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the
assessment and remeasurement of certain federal and state uncertain tax positions.        Pepco Electric Operating Statistics and Revenue

Common Shareholder         Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September
30, 2015.     DPL s net income attributable to common shareholder for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was higher than the same period in 2015 as a result of an increase in revenue net of purchased power expense
primarily resulting from customer growth and higher transmission revenue and due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expense reflecting a revision in the estimate of DPL s merger commitment costs associated with the most favored nation
provision of the merger orders. The revision in estimate included a reduction in DPL s merger commitment costs of $27 million, reflecting a reallocation of the most favored nation commitments among Exelon and DPL, such that more
commitments are expected to be obligations of Exelon for energy efficiency and other programs as opposed to obligations of DPL for additional customer rate credits.   
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015.     DPL s net loss attributable to common shareholder for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared unfavorably to DPL s net income for the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in
operating and maintenance expense due to merger-related costs.        Operating Revenue Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense
       Operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to DPL s
customers within its service territories at regulated rates. Operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on
a FERC-approved formula methodology.      Electric and natural gas revenues and purchased power and fuel expense
are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the Customer Choice Program. All DPL customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. The
customers  choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service.   
  Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and
mmcf sales, respectively) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following:       
    Retail customers purchasing electric generation and natural gas from competitive electric

Table of Contents  

   Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers
represented 51% and 53% of DPL s retail kWh sales to Delaware customers and 47% and 47% of DPL retail kWh sales to Maryland customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 54% and 51% and to Delaware customers and 49%
and 46% and to Maryland customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.     The costs
related to default electricity supply are included in Purchased power and fuel. Operating revenues also include transmission enhancement credits that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM in consideration for approved regional transmission
expansion plan expenditures.      Operating revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of
customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.
     Natural gas operating revenue includes sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue)
and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated gas revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on-system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its
service territory at regulated rates. Other gas revenue consists of off-system natural gas sales and the short-term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off-system sales are made possible
when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity.      Purchased power
consists of the cost of electricity purchased by DPL to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased fuel consists of the
cost of gas purchased by DPL to fulfill its obligation to regulated gas customers and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of gas purchased for off-system
sales.      The changes in DPL s operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 consisted of the following:       
     Revenue Decoupling.     DPL s results historically have
been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. For retail customers of DPL in Maryland, revenues are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bill stabilization
adjustment (BSA) for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer. The BSA has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered
during the period. As a result, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from customers in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer.
A modified fixed variable rate design, which would provide for a charge not tied to a customer s volumetric consumption of electricity or natural gas, has been proposed for DPL electricity and natural gas customers in Delaware. Changes in
customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the BSA applies.   
         264

Table of Contents  

   In accounting for the BSA in Maryland, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is
recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or
(ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer.   
   Weather.     The demand for electricity and natural gas in areas not subject to the BSA is
affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather
conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, operating
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was higher due to the impact of favorable summer weather conditions in DPL s service territory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, operating
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable winter weather conditions in DPL s service territory.      Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and
cooling degree days for a 20-year period in DPL s electric service territory and a 30-year period in DPL s natural gas service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in DPL s service territory for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 and normal weather consisted of the following:       
     Volume.     The increase in operating revenue net of purchased
power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer
growth.       Regulatory Required Programs.     This represents the change in operating
revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs of these programs are
included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.   
   Transmission Revenue.     Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year
to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. The increase in revenue net of purchased power expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same periods in 2015 is a result of higher rates effective June 1, 2015 related to increases in transmission plant investment and operating expenses and due to the establishment of a reserve recorded in September 2015 related to the FERC ROE
challenges, partially offset by lower revenue related to the MAPP abandonment recovery period that ended in March 2016.

     Results of Operations   ACE     

(a)  
    ACE evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense for electric sales. ACE believes Revenue net of
purchased power expense is a useful measurement of its performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. ACE has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in
accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in
this report.           Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholder     
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,
2015.     ACE s net income attributable to common shareholder for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was higher than the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in operating revenue net of purchased
power expense resulting from higher average customer usage and higher transmission revenue and due to a decrease in operating and maintenance expense reflecting a revision in the estimate of ACE s merger commitment costs associated with the
most favored nation provision of the merger orders. The revision in estimate included a reduction in ACE s merger commitment costs of $10 million, reflecting a reallocation of the most favored nation commitments among Exelon and ACE, such
that more commitments are expected to be obligations of Exelon for energy efficiency and other programs as opposed to obligations of ACE for additional customer rate credits.   
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015.     ACE s net loss attributable to common shareholder for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared unfavorably to ACE s net income for the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in
operating and maintenance expense due to merger-related costs.

     Operating Revenue Net of Purchased Power Expense     
  Operating revenues include revenue from the distribution and supply of electricity to ACE s customers within its
service territories at regulated rates. Operating revenues also include transmission service revenue that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC-approved
formula methodology.      Electric revenues and purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in
participation in the Customer Choice Program. All ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. The customer s choice of supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects
revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy service.      Retail deliveries purchased from
competitive electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kWh sales) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, consisted of the following:   
   
    Retail customers purchasing electric generation from competitive electric generation
suppliers at September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:       
    The costs related to default electricity supply are included in Purchased power expense.
Operating revenues also include revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to ACE Funding, to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds, revenue from the resale in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity
purchased under contacts with unaffiliated NUGs, and revenue from transmission enhancement credits.      Operating
revenues also include work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of
pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees.      Purchased power expense consists of the cost of
electricity purchased by ACE to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders.

   The changes in ACE s operating revenue net of purchased power expense
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 consisted of the following:       
     Weather.     The demand for electricity is affected by weather
conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries
of electricity. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was higher due to the impact of favorable
summer weather conditions in ACE s service territory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was lower due to the impact of unfavorable
winter weather conditions in ACE s service territory.      For retail customers of ACE, distribution revenues
are not decoupled for the distribution of electricity by ACE, and thus are subject to variability due to changes in customer consumption. Therefore, changes in customer usage (due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy savings programs or
other reasons) from period to period have a direct impact on reported distribution revenue for customers in ACE s service territory.      Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and
cooling degree days for a 20-year period in ACE s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in ACE s service territory for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015
consisted of the following:       
     Volume.     The increase in operating revenue net of purchased
power expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily reflects the impact of higher average customer usage.
      Distribution Rate Increase.     The increase in operating revenue net of purchased
power expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to the impact of the new electric distribution base rate charged to customers that became effective in August 2016 in
accordance with the NJBPU approved electric rate case order. See Note 5   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

    Regulatory Required Programs.     This represents
the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The costs
of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the depreciation and amortization expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.
      Transmission Revenue.     Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue
varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing adjustments. The increase in revenue net of purchased power expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016

ACE the activity presented below include its activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are
presented on a GAAP basis.     The Registrants  operating and capital expenditure requirements are provided
by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. Each
Registrant s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent
that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the Registrants have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9 billion. In addition, Generation has $525 million in
bilateral credit facilities with banks which have various expirations dates between December 2016 and May 2021. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, and provide for other short-term borrowings
and letters of credit. See the  Credit Matters  section below for further discussion. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.   
  The Registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including
construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction
projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes
place over an extended period of time. See Note 10   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants  debt and credit agreements.   
    Cash Flows from Operating Activities         General       Generation s cash flows from operating
activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to customers. Generation s future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and
its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers.      The Utility Registrants  cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO, BGE and DPL, natural gas distribution
services. The Utility Registrants  distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. The Utility Registrants  future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative
initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, competitive suppliers, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.

Table of Contents  

   The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting
Exelon s cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       

(a)  
    Represents, when applicable, depreciation, amortization and accretion, net fair value changes related to derivatives, deferred income taxes,
provision for uncollectible accounts, pension and other postretirement benefit expense, equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates and investments, decommissioning-related items, stock compensation expense, impairment of long-lived
assets, PHI merger commitment and severance charges, and other non-cash charges. See Note 19   Supplemental Financial Information for further detail on non-cash operating activity.      

(b)  
    Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities exclude the changes in commercial paper, income taxes and the current portion
of long-term debt.      
 
   Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits       Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit
restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the Twenty-first
Century Act, which contains a pension funding provision that results in lower pension contributions in the near term while increasing the premiums pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. On August 8, 2014, this funding relief
was extended for five years. On November 2, 2015 the funding relief was extended for an additional three years and premiums pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation were further increased.   
  OPEB funding generally follows accounting cost, subject to adjustment for other considerations such as liabilities
management and regulatory implications.      To the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension
plans do not earn the expected asset return rates, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase. Additionally, expected contributions could change if Exelon changes its pension or OPEB funding strategy.   
   Tax Matters       The Registrants  future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by the following tax matters:       

In order to appeal the Tax Court s like-kind exchange decision, Exelon is required to pay the tax, penalty and interest at the time Exelon
files its appeal (expected early 2017). While the final calculation of tax, penalties and interest has not yet been finalized by the IRS, Exelon estimates that a payment of approximately $1.4 billion related to the like-kind exchange will be
due, including $300 million from ComEd, in the first quarter of 2017. While Exelon will receive a tax benefit of      
         276

Table of Contents  

approximately $400 million associated with the deduction for the interest, Exelon currently has a net operating loss carryforward and thus does not expect to realize the cash benefit until
2018. Exelon s total estimated cash outflow for the like-kind exchange is $1.0 billion, of which approximately $300 million would be attributable to ComEd after giving consideration to Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless from
any unfavorable impacts of the after-tax interest and penalty amounts on ComEd s equity. ComEd will fund the $300 million with a combination of debt and equity in a manner to maintain its current capital structure. Upon a final appellate
decision, which could take up to several years, Exelon expects to receive $80 million related to final interest computations.         Of the above amounts payable, Exelon deposited with the IRS approximately $1.25 billion in October of 2016. The remaining amount will be paid in early 2017 at the time Exelon files its appeal of the Tax
Court decision. Exelon funded the $1.25 billion deposit with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings.       

In April of 2016, Exelon received tax refunds of approximately $460 million related to IRS positions settled in prior tax years. Of this amount,
approximately $195 million of the refund is attributable to Generation and the remaining $265 million is attributable to ComEd.          

State and local governments continue to face increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income tax levies, property
taxes and other taxes or the imposition, extension or permanence of temporary tax levies.      
  Cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 by Registrant were as follows:

Changes in the Registrants  cash flows from operations were generally consistent
with changes in each Registrant s respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. In addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:       Generation    

Depending upon whether Generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected
from its counterparties. In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on the exchange or in the OTC markets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
Generation had net collections of counterparty cash collateral of $759 million and $186 million, respectively, primarily due to market conditions that resulted in changes to Generation s net mark-to-market position.
     
         277

Table of Contents  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Generation had net (payments)/collections of approximately $(24) million and $27
million, respectively, related to purchases and sales of options. The level of option activity in a given period may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.
         ComEd        

During nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, ComEd posted approximately $2 million and $41 million of cash collateral to PJM,
respectively. ComEd s collateral posted with PJM has decreased year over year due to lower PJM billings. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, ComEd had approximately $33 million and $41 million cash collateral posted with PJM,
respectively.          PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Pepco, DPL and ACE received tax refund allocations from PHI in connection with the Global Tax
Settlement of $147 million, $56 million and $167 million, respectively. See Note 11   Income Taxes of the PHI 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.           Cash Flows from Investing Activities        Cash flows
used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 by Registrant were as follows:      
     
     Generation    
  Generation has entered into several agreements to acquire equity interests in privately held and development stage
entities which develop energy-related technologies. The agreements contain a series of scheduled investment commitments, including in-kind service contributions. There are approximately $108 million of anticipated expenditures remaining through
2018 to fund anticipated planned capital and operating needs of the associated companies. See Note 23   Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further details of
Generation s equity interests.

   Capital expenditures by Registrant for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and projected amounts for the full year 2016 are as follows:       

(a)  
    Total projected capital expenditures do not include adjustments for non-cash activity.      

(b)  
    The 2016 projections include approximately $623 million of expected incremental spending pursuant to EIMA, ComEd has committed to invest
approximately $2.6 billion over a ten year period, through 2022, to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology.      

(c)  
    Projected capital expenditures reflect projections after March 23, 2016.      

(d)  
    Other primarily consists of corporate operations, BSC and PHISCO.     
  Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in
economic conditions and other factors.       Generation    
  Approximately 32% and 38% of the projected 2016 capital expenditures at Generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel
and growth (primarily new plant construction and distributed generation), respectively, with the remaining amounts reflecting additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling
outages). Generation anticipates that they will fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.   
   ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE       Approximately 88%, 97%, 100%, 100%, 100% and 100% of the projected 2016 capital expenditures at ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively, are for continuing projects to maintain and improve
operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as ComEd s reliability related investments required under EIMA, and the Utility Registrants  construction commitments under
PJM s RTEP. In addition to capital expenditures for continuing projects, ComEd s total expenditures include smart grid/smart meter technology required under EIMA and for PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, include capital expenditures
related to their respective smart meter programs.      The Utility Registrants as transmission owners are subject
to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments could require the Utility Registrants to incur incremental capital or operating and
maintenance   
         279

expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards. In 2010, NERC provided guidance to transmission owners that recommended the Utility Registrants perform assessments of their
transmission lines. ComEd, PECO and BGE submitted their final bi-annual reports to NERC in January 2014. ComEd, PECO and BGE will be incurring incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of the
assessments. Specific projects and expenditures are identified as the assessments are completed. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s forecasted 2016 capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed through
2017. Pepco, DPL and ACE have substantially completed their assessments and thus do not expect significant capital expenditures related to this guidance in 2016.   
  The Utility Registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with a combination of internally
generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent, including ComEd s capital expenditures associated with EIMA as further discussed in Note 5   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.        Cash Flows from Financing Activities

    Contribution paid by PHI.         Pursuant to the orders approving the merger, Exelon made equity contributions of $73 million, $46 million and $49 million to Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016 to fund the
after-tax amount of the customer bill credit and the customer base rate credit.       Redemptions of Preference Stock
      On July 3, 2016, BGE redeemed all 400,000 shares of its outstanding 7.125% Cumulative Preference Stock,
1993 Series and all 600,000 shares of its outstanding 6.99% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1995 Series for $100 million, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On September 18, 2016, BGE redeemed all remaining 500,000 shares of its outstanding 6.97%
Cumulative Preference Stock, 1993 Series and all 400,000 shares of its outstanding 6.70% Cumulative Preference Stock, 1995 Series for $90 million, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. See Note 17   Earnings Per Share and Equity of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.       Other    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other financing activities primarily consist of debt issuance costs.
See Note 10   Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the Registrants  debt issuances.       Credit Matters       The Registrants fund liquidity needs for
capital investment, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities
include $9.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.9 billion was available as of September 30, 2016, and of which no financial institution has more than 7% of the aggregate commitments for the Registrants. The Registrants had
access to the commercial paper market during the third quarter of 2016 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit
facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants have
continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. See
PART I. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.      The Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. If Generation lost its investment grade credit rating
as of September 30, 2016, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $1.9 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payables and
receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within its current available credit facility capacities of $4.2 billion.

   The following table presents the incremental collateral that each utility
registrant would have been required to provide in the event each utility registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at September 30, 2016 and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at September 30,
2016:       

(a)

    Exelon Credit Facilities        Exelon, ComEd, and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through
the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. PHI meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL and ACE
meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and short-term notes. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding
requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.      The following table reflects the Registrants 
commercial paper programs supported by the revolving credit agreements and bilateral credit agreements at September 30, 2016:   
    Commercial Paper Programs         

(a)  
    Excludes $525 million bilateral credit facilities that do not back Generation s commercial paper program.      

(b)  
    Excludes additional credit facility agreements for Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE with aggregate commitments of $50 million, $34
million, $34 million, $5 million, $2 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively, arranged with minority and community banks located primarily within utilities  service territories. These facilities expire on October 13, 2017. These
facilities are solely utilized to issue letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, letters of credit issued under these agreements for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE totaled $7 million, $14 million, $21 million and $2 million, respectively.
        In order to maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated
above, each Registrant must have credit facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper program. While the amount of its commercial paper outstanding does not reduce available capacity under a Registrant s credit
facility, a Registrant does not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available   
         283

capacity under its credit facility. At September 30, 2016, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit facility borrowings and available capacity under their
respective credit facilities:        Credit Agreements     

(a)  
    Excludes $129 million of credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks at Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE.
These facilities expire on October 13, 2017. These facilities are solely utilized to issue letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, letters of credit issued under these agreements for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE totaled $7 million,
$14 million, $21 million and $2 million, respectively.      

(b)   
        Pepco, DPL and
ACE s revolving credit facility is subject to available borrowing capacity. The borrowing capacity may be increased or decreased during the term of the facility, except that (i) the sum of the borrowing capacity must equal the total amount of
the facility, and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by each of Pepco, DPL or ACE may not exceed $900 million or the maximum amount of short-term debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory
authorities. The total number of the borrowing reallocations may not exceed eight per year during the term of the facility      

(c)   
        Excludes
nonrecourse debt letters of credit, see Note 14   Debt and Credit Agreements in the Exelon 2015 Form 10-K for further information on Continental Wind nonrecourse debt.      

(d)   
        Excludes $525
million bilateral credit facilities that do not back Generation s commercial paper program.      

(e)   
        Excludes ExGen
Texas Power Financing s $4 million of borrowed debt on its revolving credit facility.      
  As of September 30, 2016, there was $40 million of borrowings under Generation s bilateral credit facilities.
     Borrowings under Exelon Corporate s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s,
Pepco s, DPL s, and ACE s revolving credit agreements bear interest at a rate based upon either the prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate, plus an adder based upon the particular Registrant s credit rating. The adders for the
prime based borrowings and LIBOR-based borrowings are presented in the following table:       
    The maximum adders for prime rate borrowings and LIBOR-based rate borrowings are 90 basis
points and 165 basis points, respectively. The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit ratings of the borrower.   
  Each revolving credit agreement for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE requires the affected
borrower to maintain a minimum cash from operations to interest expense ratio for the twelve-month period ended on the last day of any quarter. The following table summarizes the minimum thresholds reflected in the credit agreements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016:       
 
         284

Table of Contents  

   At September 30, 2016, the interest coverage ratios at Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE were as follows:       
    An event of default under Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO or BGE s indebtedness will
not constitute an event of default under any of the others  credit facilities, except that a bankruptcy or other event of default in the payment of principal, premium or indebtedness in principal amount in excess of $100 million in the
aggregate by Generation will constitute an event of default under the Exelon Corporate credit facility. An event of default under Pepco, DPL or ACE s indebtedness will not constitute an event of default under any of the others  credit
facilities, except that a bankruptcy or other event of default in the payment of principal, premium or indebtedness in principal amount in excess of $50 million in the aggregate will constitute an event of default under the credit facility.
     The absence of a material adverse change in Exelon s or PHI s business, property, results of
operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the credit agreement. The credit agreement does not include any rating triggers.        Security Ratings        The Registrants  access to
the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.   
  The Registrants  borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities,
although such a downgrading of a Registrant s securities could increase fees and interest charges under that Registrant s credit agreements.      As part of the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Registrants and their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of
future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the Registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely
on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of collateral. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on collateral provisions.        Intercompany Money Pool     
  To provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants
than the cost of external financing, both Exelon and PHI operate intercompany money pools. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of September 30, 2016, are
presented in the following table:

Investments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds     
  Exelon, Generation and CENG maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning nuclear
plants. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to offset inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust
funds and periodically reviews asset allocations in accordance with Generation s NDT fund investment policy. Generation s and CENG s investment policies establish limits on the concentration of holdings in any one company and also in
any one industry. See Note 12   Nuclear Decommissioning of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the trust funds, the NRC s minimum funding requirements and related liquidity
ramifications.        Shelf Registration Statements     
  Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco and DPL have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement
unlimited in amount, filed with the SEC, that will expire in August 2019. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the
time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.        Regulatory Authorizations        Generation, ComEd, PECO,
BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are required to obtain short-term and long-term financing authority from Federal and State Commissions as follows:       

(a)  
    Generation currently has blanket financing authority it received from FERC in connection with its market-based rate
authority.

Item 3.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk         The Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity prices. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies
and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy
officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of
the risk management activities. The following discussion serves as an update to ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK of the Registrants  2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated herein by reference.  
   Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)       Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies
and other factors. To the extent the amount of energy Exelon generates differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon has price risk from commodity price movements. Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the
sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel and other commodities.        Generation     
    Normal Operations and Hedging Activities.      Electricity available from
Generation s owned or contracted generation supply in excess of Generation s obligations to customers, including portions of the Utility Registrants  retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce price risk caused by
market fluctuations, Generation enters into non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation believes these instruments
represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during 2016 through 2018.   
  In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on
Generation s owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Exelon s hedging program involves the hedging of commodity risk for Exelon s expected generation, typically on a ratable basis over a three-year
period. As of September 30, 2016, the proportion of expected generation hedged is 98%-101%, 85%-88% and 54%-57% for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the
expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market
conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts including Generation s
sales to the Utility Registrants to serve their retail load.      A portion of Generation s hedging strategy
may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market
price risk exposure for Generation s entire non-proprietary trading portfolio associated with a $5 reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on September 30, 2016 market conditions and hedged position would be an
increase in pre-tax net income of approximately $5 million for 2016 and decreases of approximately $125 million and $415 million, respectively, for 2017 and 2018. Power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while
keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation expects to actively manage its portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for its unhedged position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by,
price changes, as well as future changes in Generation s portfolio.

     Proprietary Trading
Activities.      Generation also enters into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes
in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management
policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop loss and Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits to manage exposure to market risk. Additionally, the Exelon risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of
the proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities, which included physical volumes of 1,506 GWhs and 4,015 GWhs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 1,913 GWhs and 5,378 GWhs for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio, but represent a small portion of Generation s overall revenue from energy marketing activities. Proprietary
trading portfolio activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in pre-tax gains of $9 million due to net mark-to-market gains of $1 million and $8 million realized gains. Generation uses a 95% confidence interval, assuming
standard normal distribution, one day holding period and a one-tailed statistical measure in calculating its VaR. The daily VaR on proprietary trading activity averaged $0.3 million of exposure during the quarter. Generation has not segregated
proprietary trading activity within the following discussion because of the relative size of the proprietary trading portfolio in comparison to Generation s total Revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense from continuing operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $6,754 million.        Fuel
Procurement.      Generation procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply
contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price
fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at
the contracted prices. Approximately 57% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2016 through 2020 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement
uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. See ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information regarding uranium and coal
supply agreement matters.            ComEd     
  ComEd entered into 20-year contracts for renewable energy and RECs beginning in June 2012. ComEd is permitted to recover
its renewable energy and REC costs from retail customers with no mark-up. The annual commitments represent the maximum settlements with suppliers for renewable energy and RECs under the existing contract terms. Pursuant to the ICC s Order on
December 19, 2012, ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. In addition, the ICC s December 18, 2013 Order approved the reduction of ComEd s
commitments under those contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, and the amount of the reduction was approved by the ICC in March 2014. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding energy procurement and derivatives.        PECO     
  PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in
its PAPUC-approved DSP Programs, which are further discussed in Note 5   Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO has certain full requirements   

         289

Table of Contents  

contracts which are considered derivatives and qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result are accounted for
on an accrual basis of accounting. Under the DSP Programs, PECO is permitted to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up.   
  PECO has also entered into derivative natural gas contracts, which either qualify for the normal purchases and normal
sales exception or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge its long-term price risk in the natural gas market. PECO s hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on its financial
position or results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.      PECO
does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
       BGE        BGE procures electric supply for default service customers through full requirements contracts pursuant to BGE s MDPSC-approved SOS program. BGE s full requirements contracts that are considered
derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result, are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Under the SOS program, BGE is permitted to recover
its electricity procurement costs from retail customers, plus an administrative fee which includes a shareholder return component and an incremental cost component. However, through December 2016, BGE provides all residential electric customers a
credit for the residential shareholder return component of the administrative charge.      BGE has also entered
into derivative natural gas contracts, which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception, to hedge its price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on BGE s
financial position. However, under BGE s market-based rates incentive mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost
and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers.      BGE does not enter into
derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
    Pepco        Pepco has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC. The SOS rates charged recover Pepco s wholesale power
supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for residential and commercial rate classes. Pepco s price risk related to electric supply
procurement is limited. Pepco locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of Pepco s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception
under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other Pepco full requirements contracts are not derivatives.   
  Pepco does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on
these contracts, see Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     DPL     
  DPL has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by
the MDPSC and the DPSC. The SOS rates charged recover DPL s wholesale power supply costs. In Delaware, DPL is also entitled to recover a Reasonable Allowance for Retail Margin (RARM). The RARM includes a fixed annual margin of
approximately $2.75 million, plus an incremental cost component and a cash working capital allowance. In Maryland, DPL charges an administrative fee intended to allow it to recover its administrative costs. DPL locks in fixed prices for all of its
SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. DPL s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. Certain of DPL s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception
under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other DPL full requirements contracts are not derivatives.   
  DPL provides natural gas to its customers under a GCR mechanism approved by the DPSC. The demand portion of the GCR is
based upon DPL s firm transportation and storage contracts. DPL has firm deliverability of swing and seasonal storage; a liquefied natural gas facility and firm transportation capacity to meet customer demand and provide a reserve margin. The
commodity portion of the GCR includes a commission approved hedging program which is intended to reduce gas commodity price volatility while limiting the firm natural gas customers  exposure to adverse changes in the market price of natural
gas.      DPL does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. See Note 9  
Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding energy procurement and derivatives.        ACE        ACE has contracts to procure BGS electric
supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. The BGS rates charged recover ACE s wholesale power supply costs. ACE does not make any profit or incur any loss on the supply component of the BGS it
supplies to customers. ACE s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. ACE locks in fixed prices for all of its BGS requirements through full requirements contracts. ACE s full requirements contracts, which are
considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other ACE full requirements contracts are not derivatives.   
  ACE does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these
contracts, see Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        Trading and Non-Trading Marketing Activities.      The following detailed presentation of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PHI s and DPL s trading
and non-trading marketing activities is included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy industry s Committee of Chief Risk Officers (CCRO).

Table of Contents  

   The following table provides detail on changes in Exelon s,
Generation s, ComEd s, PHI s and DPL s commodity mark-to-market net asset or liability balance sheet position from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. It indicates the drivers behind changes in the balance sheet
amounts. This table incorporates the mark-to-market activities that are immediately recorded in earnings. This table excludes all normal purchase and normal sales contracts and does not segregate proprietary trading activity. See Note 9  
Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the balance sheet classification of the mark-to-market energy contract net assets (liabilities) recorded as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       

(a)  
    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, PHI s and DPL s mark-to-market derivative asset was fully collateralized
resulting in a zero balance. For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 to March 23, 2016, PHI recorded a $1 million increase in fair value and $1 million decrease in allocated collateral related to the exchange-traded
futures.     

(c)  
    Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties.      

(d)  
    For ComEd and DPL, the changes in fair value are recorded as a change in regulatory assets or liabilities. As of September 30, 2016, ComEd
recorded a $244 million regulatory asset related to its mark-to-market derivative liabilities with unaffiliated suppliers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, ComEd also recorded $10 million of decreases in fair value and realized losses
due to settlements of $13 million recorded in purchased power expense associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers. As of September 30, 2016, DPL recorded a $1 million regulatory liability related to
its mark-to-market derivative liabilities.     

(e)  
    Includes derivative contracts acquired or sold by Generation through upfront payments or receipts of cash, excluding option premiums, and the
associated amortizations.      

(f)  
    Includes fair value from contracts received at acquisition of ConEdison Solutions of $(59) million.      
    Fair Values.      The following tables present maturity and source of fair value for
Exelon, Generation and ComEd mark-to-market commodity contract net assets (liabilities). The tables provide two fundamental pieces of information. First, the tables provide the source of fair value used in determining the carrying amount of the
Registrants  total mark-to-market net assets (liabilities), net of allocated collateral. Second, the tables show the maturity, by year, of the Registrants  commodity contract net assets (liabilities), net of allocated collateral, giving an
indication of when these mark-to-market amounts will settle and either generate or require cash. See Note 8   Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy.

         Credit Risk, Collateral and Contingent Related Features (All Registrants)    
  The Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter
into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of credit risk, collateral and contingent related features.

Table of Contents  

     Generation     
  The following tables provide information on Generation s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, normal
purchase normal sales agreements, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of September 30, 2016. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of
the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the duration of a company s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. The figures in the tables below
exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail customers, uranium procurement contracts, and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE and Nodal commodity exchanges, which are discussed below. Additionally, the figures in the tables below exclude
exposures with affiliates, including net receivables with ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE of $24 million, $45 million, $22 million, $47 million, $12 million, and $10 million as of September 30, 2016, respectively.   

(a)  
    As of September 30, 2016, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $10 million of cash and $22
million of letters of credit. The credit collateral does not include non-liquid collateral.           ComEd,
PECO and BGE        There have been no significant changes or additions to ComEd s, PECO s, or
BGE s exposures to credit risk that are described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of Exelon s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

       There have been no significant changes or additions to PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s or
ACE s exposures to credit risk as described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of PHI s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding credit exposure to suppliers.   
    Collateral (All Registrants)         Generation       As part of the normal course of business,
Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas and other commodities. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit Generation and its counterparties to
demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level
below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation s net position with a counterparty, the
demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of
the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into
the disclosure below. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding collateral requirements.   
  Generation transacts output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which
relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows
and financial position. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral
with Generation. In order to post collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See Liquidity and Capital Resources   Credit Matters   Exelon Credit
Facilities for additional information.      As of September 30, 2016, Generation had cash collateral of $501
million posted and cash collateral held of $18 million for external counterparties with derivative positions, of which $485 million and $3 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against energy derivative and interest rate and foreign
exchange derivative related to underlying energy contracts, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, $5 million of cash collateral held was not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives
or as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. See Note 18   Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash
collateral.       ComEd       As of September 30, 2016, ComEd held $3 million in collateral from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts and held approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of
credit for renewable

energy contracts. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and Note 3   Regulatory Matters of the 2015
Exelon Form 10-K for additional information.       PECO    
  As of September 30, 2016, PECO was not required to post collateral under its energy and natural gas procurement
contracts. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       BGE       BGE is not required to post collateral under its
electric supply contracts. As of September 30, 2016, BGE was not required to post collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts nor was it holding collateral under its electric supply and natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 9
  Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
   Pepco       Pepco is not required to post collateral under its energy procurement contracts. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.       DPL       DPL is not required to post collateral under its energy procurement contracts. As of September 30, 2016, DPL was not required to post collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts. See Note
9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       ACE       ACE is not required to post collateral under its
energy procurement contracts. See Note 9   Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.        RTOs and ISOs (All Registrants)        Generation, ComEd,
PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE participate in all, or some, of the established, real-time energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, ISO-NY, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, OIESO and ERCOT. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral
agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot markets that are operated by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the
spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that
losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of
operations, cash flows and financial positions.        Exchange Traded Transactions (Exelon, Generation, PHI and DPL)     
  Generation enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE and the Nodal exchange. DPL enters into commodity transactions
on ICE. The NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on NYMEX,
ICE and Nodal exchange are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.

     Long-Term Leases (Exelon)     
  On March 31, 2016, UII and MEAG finalized an agreement to terminate the MEAG Headleases, the MEAG Leases, and other
related agreements prior to their expiration dates. As a result of the lease termination, UII received an early termination payment of $360 million from MEAG and wrote-off the $356 million net investment in the MEAG Headleases and the Leases. The
transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4 million which is reflected in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 6   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and PHI)       The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and
variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Exelon registrants may also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition,
the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to manage interest rate risks. At September 30,
2016, Exelon had $800 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and Generation had $672 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges outstanding, respectively. Assuming the fair value and cash flow interest rate
hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in approximately a $5 million decrease in Exelon
Consolidated pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency
derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges.       Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)    
  Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning
Generation s nuclear plants. As of September 30, 2016, Generation s decommissioning trust funds are reflected at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to
be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate,
fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation s NDT fund investment policy. A
hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a $535 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in
interest rates and equity prices. See ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of equity price risk as a result of the current capital and credit market
conditions.         Item 4.    Controls and Procedures    
  During the third quarter of 2016, each of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s,
PHI s, Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing and
reporting of information in its periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by all Registrants to ensure that (a) material information relating to that Registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to Exelon s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that Registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded,   
         297

Table of Contents  

processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all
misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.      Accordingly, as of September 30,
2016, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE concluded that such Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish its
objectives. All Registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. On March 23, 2016, the
merger between Exelon and PHI closed. Exelon is currently in the process of integrating PHI s operations, processes and internal controls. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third
quarter of 2016, other than changes resulting from the PHI Merger, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s, BGE s, PHI s,
Pepco s, DPL s and ACE s internal control over financial reporting. See Note 4   Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the PHI
acquisition. Exelon s management expects that the controls over financial reporting associated with PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE from the date of the merger forward will be covered in the year-end assessment.

    1999 sale of fossil generating assets.   On September 19, 2016, the Tax Court rejected Exelon s like-kind
exchange position and ruled that Exelon was not entitled to defer gain on the transaction. In addition, contrary to Exelon s evaluation that the penalty was unwarranted, the Tax Court ruled that Exelon is liable for the penalty and after-tax
interest due on the asserted penalty. In early 2017, Exelon expects to timely appeal this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.      In order to appeal the Tax Court s like-kind exchange decision, Exelon is required to pay the tax, penalty and interest for the tax years before the Court at the time Exelon files its appeal
(expected early 2017). Exelon deposited with the IRS approximately $1,250 million in October 2016. The total amount of tax, penalty and interest payable is currently being computed pursuant to the Tax Court rules. Any remaining amounts
due, which are not expected to be materially different from the amount deposited, will be paid in early 2017 at the time Exelon files its appeal of the Tax Court decision. If Exelon s deposit exceeds the final Tax Court computation, Exelon can
request a return of the excess.       Risks Related to the PHI Merger    
   The merger may not achieve its anticipated results, and Exelon may be unable to integrate the operations of PHI in the manner expected.
      Exelon and PHI entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in
various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Exelon and PHI can be integrated
in an efficient, effective and timely manner.   
         299

Table of Contents  

   It is possible that the integration process could take longer than
anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of Exelon s businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices and policies, any of which could adversely affect the
combined company s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger as and when expected. Exelon may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these
anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and could adversely affect Exelon s future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.       The merger may not be accretive to earnings and may cause dilution to Exelon s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Exelon s common stock.    
  The timing and amount of accretion expected could be significantly adversely affected by a number of uncertainties,
including market conditions, risks related to Exelon s businesses and whether the business of PHI is integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Exelon also could encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs, may fail to
realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in Exelon s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected
accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Exelon s common stock.       Exelon may incur unexpected
transaction fees and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.       Exelon expects to incur a number
of non-recurring expenses associated with completing the merger, as well as expenses related to combining the operations of the two companies. Exelon may incur additional unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of Exelon and PHI.
Although Exelon expects that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time,
the combined company may not achieve this net benefit in the near term, or at all.       Exelon may encounter unexpected
difficulties or costs in meeting commitments it made under various orders and agreements associated with regulatory approvals for the PHI Merger.       As a result of the process to obtain regulatory approvals required for the PHI Merger, Exelon is committed to various programs, contributions and investments in several settlement agreements and
regulatory approval orders. It is possible that Exelon may encounter delays, unexpected difficulties, or additional costs in meeting these commitments in compliance with the terms of the relevant agreements and orders. Failure to fulfill the
commitments in accordance with their terms could result in increased costs or result in penalties or fines that could adversely affect Exelon s financial position and operating results.

EXELON CORPORATION   
  CHANGE-IN-CONTROL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  
 THIS AGREEMENT, entered into as of
                     (the   Agreement Date  ), is made by and among Exelon Corporation, incorporated under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (together with successors thereto, the   Company  ), on behalf of itself and                     , a
                    corporation (together with successors thereto, the   Subsidiary  ),
and (  Executive  ). [The Agreement has been amended and restated as of                     , 2016.]  
  RECITALS     The Board of
Directors of the Company (the   Board  ) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued services of the Executive, despite the possibility or
occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to reduce the distraction of the Executive that would result from the personal uncertainties caused by a pending or threatened Change in Control or a Significant
Acquisition, to encourage the Executive s full attention and dedication to the Company, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which are competitive with those of similarly-situated
corporations. This Agreement is intended to accomplish these objectives.     Article I.   
  Definitions     As used in
this Agreement, the terms specified below shall have the following meanings:    1.1   Accrued Annual Incentive   means the
amount of any Annual Incentive earned but not yet paid with respect to the Company s latest fiscal year ended prior to the Termination Date.  
 1.2   Accrued Base Salary   means the amount of Executive s Base Salary that is accrued but not yet paid as of the
Termination Date.    1.3   Accrued Obligations   means, as of any date, the sum of Executive s Accrued Base Salary,
Accrued Annual Incentive, any accrued but unpaid paid time off, and any other amounts and benefits which are then due to be paid or provided to Executive by the Company, but have not yet been paid or provided (as applicable).  
 1.4   Affiliate   means any Person (including the Subsidiary) that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Company. For purposes of this definition the term  control  with respect to any Person means the power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of such Person, directly or indirectly,

   1.6   Agreement Term   means the period commencing on the Agreement Date and ending on the second anniversary of the

automatically be extended each day by one day to create a new two-year term until, at any time after the first anniversary of the Agreement Date, the Company delivers written notice (an   Expiration Notice  ) to Executive that the
Agreement shall expire on a date specified in the Expiration Notice (the   Expiration Date  ) that is not less than 12 months after the date the Expiration Notice is delivered to Executive; provided, however, that if a Change Date,
Imminent Control Change, Disaggregation or Significant Acquisition occurs before the Expiration Date specified in the Expiration Notice, then such Expiration Notice shall be void and of no further effect. If such Imminent Control Change or
Disaggregation does not culminate in a Change Date, then such Expiration Notice shall be reinstated and the Agreement shall expire on the date originally specified as the Expiration Date, or if later, the date the Imminent Control Change lapses or
the end of the sixtieth day after the Disaggregation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Agreement Term shall end at the end of the Severance Period if applicable, or if there is no Severance Period, the earliest of the following:
(a) the second anniversary of the Change Date, (b) eighteen (18) months after the Significant Acquisition, provided there has been no Change Date, (c) the end of the sixtieth day after the Disaggregation if there has been no Change Date after the
Disaggregation, or (d) the Termination Date.    1.7   Annual Incentive     see Section 2.7.

corporation are directly or indirectly owned by another corporation, such other corporation.    1.14   Cash Performance

subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change in Control: (1) any acquisition directly from the Company (excluding any acquisition resulting from the exercise of an exercise, conversion or exchange privilege
unless the security being so exercised, converted or exchanged was acquired directly from the Company), (2) any acquisition by the Company, (3) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the
Company or any corporation controlled by the Company (a   Company Plan  ), or (4) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this
definition; provided further, that for purposes of clause (2), if any 20% Owner of the Company other than the Company or any Company Plan becomes a 20% Owner by reason of an acquisition by the Company, and such 20% Owner of the Company shall,
after such acquisition by the Company, become the beneficial owner of any additional outstanding common shares of the Company or any additional outstanding Voting Securities of the Company (other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan or
arrangement maintained by the Company) and such beneficial ownership is publicly announced, such additional beneficial ownership shall constitute a Change in Control; or  
 (b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the   Incumbent Board  ) cease for any reason
to constitute at least a majority of the Incumbent Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company s shareholders, was approved by a vote
of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual
 
      3  

whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual
or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or    (c) Consummation of
a reorganization, merger or consolidation (  Merger  ), or the sale or other disposition of more than 50% of the operating assets of the Company (determined on a consolidated basis), other than in connection with a sale-leaseback or
other arrangement resulting in the continued utilization of such assets (or the operating products of such assets) by the Company (such reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition, a   Corporate Transaction

omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.    (b)  Procedural
Requirements for Termination for Cause During a Post-Change Period . The Executive s Termination of Employment for which the Notice of Termination is given during a Post-Change Period shall not be deemed to be for Cause under this Section
3.3 unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than 60% of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of such Board called and held for such purpose
(after reasonable written notice of such meeting is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive s
acts, or failure to act, constitutes Cause and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.    (c)  Procedural
Requirements for Termination for Cause During a Post-Disaggregation Period . In the event Executive s Termination of Employment is from a Disaggregated Entity in a Post-Disaggregation Period, the procedural requirements for termination for
Cause in this Section 3.3 shall be applied by substituting  Disaggregated Entity  for  Company,   affiliate of the Disaggregated Entity  for  Affiliate,  and  Disaggregated Entity s Board  for
 Board.  Further, the Company shall have no obligation to provide payments or benefits under Section 4.3 if the Board determines that the Company could have terminated Executive s employment for Cause if the Executive had been
employed by the Company, such determination by the Board to be made as provided in Section 3.3(b) but applying the flush language at the end of Section 3.3(a) by substituting  Disaggregated Entity  for  Company  and
 Disaggregated Entity s Board  for  Board.     (d)  Procedural Requirements for Termination for
Cause During the Imminent Control Change Period or Post-Significant Acquisition Period . The Executive s Termination of Employment for which the Notice of Termination is given during the Imminent Control Change Period or Post-Significant
Acquisition Period shall not be deemed to be for Cause under this Section 3.3 unless and until there shall have been delivered to the  
      17  

Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board, finding that the Executive s acts or failure to act,
constitute Cause and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Executive shall receive advance notice of such vote of the Board, but shall not have the right to appear in person or by counsel before the Board.

Acquisition Period or Post-Disaggregation Period, Executive may terminate his or her employment for Good Reason in accordance with the substantive and procedural provisions of this Section 3.4.  
 (a)  Definition of Good Reason . For purposes of this Section 3.4, and subject to the provisions of subsections (b)
through (e),  Good Reason  means the occurrence of any one or more of the following actions or omissions prior to the Termination Date during the Post-Change Period, the Imminent Control Change Period, the Post-Significant Acquisition
Period or the Post-Disaggregation Period:    (i) a material reduction of the Executive s salary, incentive compensation
opportunity or aggregate benefits unless such reduction is part of a policy, program or arrangement applicable to peer executives (including peer executives of any successor to the Company);  
 (ii) a material adverse reduction in the Executive s position, duties, or responsibilities, other than in a
Post-Significant Acquisition period, and other than a change in the position or level of officer to whom the Executive reports or a change that is part of a policy, program or arrangement applicable to peer executives (including peer executives of
any successor to the Company);    (iii) the failure of any successor to the Company to assume this Agreement;  
 (iv) a relocation (other than in a Post-Significant Acquisition Period), by more than 50 miles of (I) the Executive s
primary workplace, or (II) the principal offices of the Company or its successor (if such offices are the Executive s workplace), in each case without Executive s consent; provided, however, in both cases of (I) and (II) of this
Section 3.4(a)(iv), such new location is farther from Executive s residence then the prior location; or    (v) a
material breach of this Agreement by the Company or its successor;    provided that the occurrence of a Disaggregation shall not be Good
Reason if the Executive retains substantially the same position (determined without regard to reporting requirements) with the Disaggregated Entity, with substantially the same compensation and benefits in the aggregate, as immediately prior to such
Disaggregation, notwithstanding Sections 3.4(a)(i), 3.4(a)(ii) and 3.4(a)(v).  
      18  

(b)  Application of  Good Reason  Definition During the Imminent
Control Change Period . During the Imminent Control Change Period,  Good Reason  shall not include the events or conditions described in Section 3.4(a)(i), 3.4(a)(ii) or 3.4(a)(iv) unless the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in
a Change Date. Further, if Executive s Termination of Employment occurs during an Imminent Control Change Period that culminates in a Change Date, then, except as provided in Section 3.4(c), the definition of  Good Reason  shall be
applied as though Sections 2.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 were applicable during the Imminent Control Change Period prior to the Executive s Termination of Employment.  
 (c)  Special Conditions Relating to Good Reason During the Post-Disaggregation Period . If Executive is employed with the
Disaggregated Entity immediately following a Disaggregation, then (1) Section 3.4(a)(ii) shall apply with respect to the Executive s position, duties or responsibilities as in effect on the day before the Disaggregation, (2) subsection
3.4(a)(iv) shall apply with respect to relocations that are required after the Disaggregation and prior to the expiration of the Post-Disaggregation Period and shall be applied by substituting  Disaggregated Entity  for  any successor
to the Company,  and (3) all references in Section 3.4 to the Company or its successor shall be to the Disaggregated Entity or its successor.  
 (d)  Limitations on Good Reason . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4, no act or omission shall
constitute a material breach of this Agreement by the Company, nor grounds for  Good Reason :    (i) unless the
Executive gives the Company a Notice of Termination at least 30 days  prior to the Termination Date and the Company fails to cure such act or omission within the 30-day period;  
 (ii) if the Executive first acquired knowledge of such act or omission more than 90 days before the Executive gives the Company
and the Employer such Notice of Termination; or    (iii) if the Executive has consented in writing to such act or omission.
   (e)  Notice by Executive . In the event of any Termination of Employment by Executive for Good Reason, Executive
shall as soon as practicable thereafter notify the Company and the Employer (and Disaggregated Entity, if applicable) of the events constituting such Good Reason by a Notice of Termination. Subject to the limitations in Section 3.4(d), a delay in
the delivery of such Notice of Termination shall not waive any right of Executive under this Agreement.

salary and incentives for any plan year or calendar year, as applicable, shall be deemed to be not less than the Executive s Base Salary and Annual Incentive.  
 (ii) The cost of such welfare benefits to Executive and family under this Section 4.1(e) shall not exceed the cost of such

 (g)  Termination during the Post-Change Period or Post-Significant Acquisition
Period:     Indemnification . The Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification than was permitted prior to such amendment) and the Company s by-laws as such exist on the Applicable Trigger Date if the Executive
was, is, or is threatened to be, made a party to any pending, completed or threatened action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding brought by a third party (and not
by or on behalf of the Company or its shareholders) whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or was, or had agreed to become, a director, officer, employee,
agent, or fiduciary of the Company or any other entity which the Executive is or was serving at the request of the Company (  Proceeding  ), against all expenses (including all reasonable attorneys  fees) and all claims, damages,
liabilities and losses incurred or suffered by the Executive or to which the Executive may become subject for any reason; provided, that the Company shall not be required to indemnify the Executive in connection with any proceeding initiated by the
Executive, including a counterclaim or cross claim, unless such proceeding was authorized by the Company and Executive fully cooperates in the investigation and defense of such Proceeding. A Proceeding shall not include any proceeding to the extent
it concerns or relates to a matter described in Section 6.1(a) (concerning reimbursement of certain costs and expenses). Upon receipt from Executive of (i) a written request for an advancement of expenses, which Executive reasonably
believes will be subject to indemnification hereunder and (ii) a written undertaking by Executive to repay any such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that Executive is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, the
Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, advance such expenses to Executive or pay such expenses for Executive, all in advance of the final disposition of any such matter.

coverage under a directors  and officers  liability insurance policy in an amount no less than, and on terms no less favorable than, those provided to senior executive officers and directors of the Company on the Applicable Trigger Date.
   4.2  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period . If, during an Imminent Control Change Period, Executive has a
Termination of Employment that would entitle Executive to benefits under Section 4 of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan or its successor, then the Company shall, prior to the occurrence of a Change Date, provide Executive any
benefits to which Executive may be entitled under Section 4 (i.e., non-change in control) of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan or its successor. If, during an Imminent Control Change Period, the Employer terminates
Executive s employment other than for Disability and other than for Cause, or if Executive terminates employment for Good Reason then subject to the preceding sentence, unless such Termination of Employment occurred during the Post-Significant
Acquisition Period, the Company s sole obligations to Executive under Articles II and IV shall be as set forth in this Section 4.2. The Company s obligations to Executive under this Section 4.2 shall be reduced by any amounts or
benefits paid or provided pursuant to the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan (whether under Section 4 thereof or any other provision) or any successor thereto. If Executive s Termination of Employment occurred during any
portion of an Imminent Control Change Period that is also a Post-Significant Acquisition Period, the Company s obligations to Executive, if any, shall be determined under Section 4.1.  
 (a)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period:     Cash Severance Payments . If the Imminent
Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Executive the amounts described in Section 4.1(a)(i) through (vi). Such amounts shall be paid to Executive as described in Section 4.4, provided
that amounts that would have been paid prior to the Change Date shall be paid in a lump sum (without interest) within 30 business days after the Change Date.  
 (b)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period:     Vested Stock Options . Executive s
Stock Options, to the extent vested on the Termination Date,    (i) will not expire (unless such Stock Options would have
expired had Executive remained an employee of the Company) during the Imminent Control Change Period; and    (ii) will
continue to be exercisable after the Termination Date to the extent provided in the applicable grant agreement or Plan, and thereafter, such Stock Options shall not be exercisable during the Imminent Control Change Period.  
      24  

If the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date, then Executive s Stock
Options, to the extent vested on the Termination Date, may be exercised, in whole or in part, during the 30-day period following the lapse of the Imminent Control Change Period, or, if longer, the period during which Executive s vested Stock
Options could otherwise be exercised under the terms of the applicable grant agreement or Plan (but in no case shall any Stock Options remain exercisable after the date on which such Stock Options would have expired if Executive had remained an
employee of the Company).    If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, then effective upon the Change Date,
Executive s Stock Options, to the extent vested on the Termination Date, may be exercised in whole or in part by the Executive at any time until the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Change Date or the respective option expiration dates
for such Stock Options; provided that this Section shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in connection with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.  
 (c)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period:     Unvested Stock Options . Executive s
Stock Options that are not vested on the Termination Date    (i) will not expire (unless such Stock Options would have
expired had Executive remained an employee of the Company) during the Imminent Control Change Period; and    (ii) will not
continue to vest and will not be exercisable during the Imminent Control Change Period after the expiration of the period for post-termination exercise under the terms of the applicable Stock Option Agreement.  
 If the Imminent Control Change lapses without a Change Date, such unvested Stock Options will thereupon expire.  
 If the Imminent Control Change culminates in a Change Date, then immediately prior to the Change Date, such unvested Stock Options shall become
fully vested, and may thereupon be exercised in whole or in part by the Executive at any time until the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Change Date, or the respective option expiration dates for such Stock Options; provided that this Section
shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in connection with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.  
 (d)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period:     Performance Shares and Cash Performance
Awards .   Executive s Performance Shares granted under the Exelon Performance Share Program under the LTIP will not be forfeited during the Imminent Control Change Period, and will not continue to vest during the Imminent Control
Change Period. If the Imminent Control Change lapses without a Change Date,  
      25  

such Performance Shares shall be governed according to the terms of Section 4 of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan. If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a
Change Date:    (i) To the extent the performance period applicable to the Performance Shares or Cash Performance Awards has
ended as of the Change Date, including performance periods that are terminated early in connection with the Change in Control, such Performance Shares or Awards shall become fully vested, based on the performance level attained or deemed to have
been attained in connection with the Change in Control.    (ii) To the extent the performance period applicable to the
Performance Shares or Cash Performance Awards has not ended as of the Change Date, such Performance Shares or Awards shall become fully vested based on the extent to which the performance goals established under the LTIP for such performance period
are attained as of the last day of the performance period.    (e)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change
Period:     Restricted Stock . Executive s unvested Restricted Stock will:    (i) not be forfeited
during the Imminent Control Change Period; and    (ii) not continue to vest during the Imminent Control Change Period.  
 If the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date, such unvested Restricted Stock shall thereupon be forfeited.  
 If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, then immediately prior to the Change Date, Executive s Restricted Stock
shall (except as specifically provided to the contrary in the award) become fully vested.    (f)  Termination During an
Imminent Control Change Period:     Continuation of Welfare Benefits . The Company shall continue to provide to Executive and Executive s family welfare benefits (other than any severance pay that may be considered a welfare
benefit) during the Imminent Change Period which are at least as favorable as welfare benefits under the most favorable Welfare Plans of the Company applicable with respect to peer executives who are actively employed after the Termination Date and
their families; subject to the following:    (i) In determining benefits applicable under such Welfare Plans, the
Executive s annual compensation attributable to base salary and incentives for any plan year or calendar year, as applicable, shall be deemed to be not less than the Executive s Base Salary and Annual Incentive;  
      26  

(ii) The cost of such welfare benefits to Executive and family under this Section
4.2(f) shall not exceed the cost of such benefits to peer executives who are actively employed after the Termination Date.  
 (iii) Health care coverage under this Section 4.2(f) shall be in lieu of any post-termination continuation coverage rights the
Executive may have pursuant to applicable law, including, without limitation, continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code ( COBRA ). At the end of the Severance Period, Executive may elect, at his expense, COBRA
continuation coverage for the remaining balance of the statutory coverage period, if any.    If the Imminent Control Change Period lapses
without a Change Date, welfare benefit plan coverage under this Section 4.2(f) shall thereupon cease, subject to Executive s rights, if any, to continued coverage under a Welfare Plan, Section 4 of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management
Severance Plan, or applicable law. If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, then for the remainder of the Severance Period (and continuing through such later date as any Welfare Plan may specify), the Company shall continue
to provide Executive and Executive s family welfare benefits as described in, and subject to the limitations of Section 4.1(e).  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive obtains a specific type of coverage under welfare plan(s) sponsored by another employer of
Executive (e.g. medical, prescription, vision, dental, disability, individual life insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits, but excluding for the purposes of this sentence retiree benefits if Executive is so eligible), then the Company
shall not be obligated to provide such any specific type of coverage. The Executive shall immediately notify the Company of any such coverage.  
 (g)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period:     Outplacement . To the extent actually
incurred by Executive, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid on behalf of Executive, as incurred, all reasonable fees and costs charged by a nationally recognized outplacement firm selected by the Executive for outplacement services provided up
to 12 months after the Termination Date. No cash shall be paid in lieu of such fees and costs.    (h)  Termination During
an Imminent Control Change Period:     Indemnification . The Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the same extent as provided in Section 4.1(g), but only during the Imminent Control Change Period (or
greater period provided under the Company s by-laws) if the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date.  
 (i)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period:     Directors  and Officers  Liability
Insurance . The Company shall provide the same level of directors  and officers  liability insurance for Executive as provided in Section 4.1(h), but only during the Imminent Control Change Period (or greater period provided under the
Company s by-laws) if the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date.  
      27  

4.3  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation Period . If, during a Post-Disaggregation

Post-Disaggregation Period:     Stock Options . All of Executive s Stock Options granted prior to the Disaggregation that have not expired, whether or not converted to options or stock of the Disaggregated Entity or Merger
Survivor, shall be fully vested, and may be exercised in whole or in part by the Executive at any time until the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date or the respective option expiration dates for such Stock Options; provided that
this Section shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in connection with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.

Executive s Performance Shares or Cash Performance Awards granted prior to the Disaggregation, whether or not earned by and awarded to the Executive as of the Disaggregation, and whether or not converted to performance shares or awards of the
Disaggregated Entity or the Merger Survivor, shall become vested in accordance with this Section 4.3(c). To the extent the performance period applicable to any such Performance Shares or Cash Performance Awards has ended as of the Termination Date,
such Performance Shares or Awards shall become fully vested, based on the performance level attained. To the extent the performance period applicable to any Performance Shares or Cash Performance Awards has not ended as of the Termination Date, such
Performance Shares or Awards shall become fully vested based on the extent to which the performance goals established under the LTIP for such performance period are attained as of the last day of the performance period.

Period, the Company shall continue to provide to Executive and Executive s family welfare benefits with the same rights in relation to continuation coverage, status in relation to other employer benefits, scope and cost as described in Section

      28  

whether pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or otherwise, the continued coverage required hereunder shall be provided under the plans of the Disaggregated Entity (and the Company shall
reimburse the cost to Executive of such coverage).    (f)  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation
Period:     Outplacement . To the extent actually incurred by Executive, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid on behalf of Executive, as incurred, all reasonable fees and costs charged by a nationally recognized outplacement

 (a) Beginning no later than forty five days after the Termination Date, the Company shall make periodic payments to the
Executive according to the Company s normal payroll practices at a monthly rate equal to 1/12 of the sum of (i) the Executive s Base Salary in effect as of the Termination Date plus (ii) the Severance Incentive; and  
 (b) Within 30 business days of the second anniversary of the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a cash lump sum
equal to the difference between the total Severance Payment less the total amount paid pursuant to normal payroll practices under Section 4.4(a);  
 provided that in the event the Company determines that Executive is a  specified employee,  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and that
certain of the payments made to Executive under Section 4.1(a)(vi) constitute the payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, then any of such payments that pursuant to this Section 4.4 would be paid prior to the
six-month anniversary of Executive s Termination Date shall, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, be delayed and be paid to Executive on the six-month anniversary of Executive s Termination Date. The Stock Options,
Performance Shares and Restricted Stock awards shall be paid in accordance with the LTIP and the applicable award  
      29  

agreements; provided that, in the event the Company determines that Executive is a  specified employee,  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and that an award constitutes
the payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, then any payment of such award pursuant to this Section 4.4 that would be paid prior to the six-month anniversary of Executive s Termination Date shall, to the
extent required by Section 409A of the Code, be delayed and paid to Executive on the six-month anniversary of Executive s Termination Date. The in-kind benefits and reimbursements provided under each of Sections 4.1(e), 4.1(g), 4.2(f), 4.2(h),
4.3(e) and 4.4(g) during any calendar year shall not affect the benefits or reimbursements to be provided under such section in any subsequent calendar year. The right to such benefits and reimbursements shall not be subject to liquidation or
exchange for any other benefit.    4.5  Waiver and Release . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Executive s right to
the benefits provided under Article IV or Article V hereof shall be contingent upon (i) Executive having executed and delivered to the Company a waiver and general release provided by the Company (the  Waiver and Release ) not later than
the date set forth in the release (but in no event more than 45 days after the Termination Date) (the  Consideration Period ), (ii) Executive not revoking such release in accordance with the terms of the release and (ii) Executive not
violating any of Executive s on-going obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company has the discretion to pay such benefits prior to receipt of the Waiver and Release and/or the expiration of the revocation period;
provided further that if Executive does not execute and deliver a release to the Company prior to the expiration of the Consideration Period or if the Executive revokes the release in accordance with its terms, Executive shall pay to the Company
within 10 days following the expiration of the Consideration Period or the date such release was revoked, a lump sum payment of all payments received by Executive to date hereunder.  
 4.6  Breach of Covenants . If a court determines that Executive has breached any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidential
information or intellectual property covenant entered into between Executive and Company, the Company shall not be obligated to pay or provide any severance or benefits under Articles IV or V, all unexercised Stock Options shall terminate as of the
date of the breach, and all Restricted Stock shall be forfeited as of the date of the breach.    4.7  Termination by the Company for
Cause . If the Company (or Affiliate or, if applicable, the Disaggregated Entity) terminates Executive s employment for Cause during the Post-Change Period, the Imminent Control Change Period, the Post-Significant Acquisition Period, or the
Post-Disaggregation Period, the Company s sole obligation to Executive under Articles II, IV, and V shall be to pay Executive, pursuant to the Company s then-effective Plans, a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations
determined as of the Termination Date. The remaining applicable provisions of this Agreement (including the restrictive covenants in Article VIII) shall continue to apply.  
 4.8  Termination by Executive Other Than for Good Reason . If Executive elects to retire or otherwise terminate employment during the
Post-Change Period, the Imminent Control Change Period, the Post-Significant Acquisition Period, or the Post-Disaggregation Period, other than for Good Reason, Disability or death, the Company s sole obligation to Executive under
 
      30  

Articles II, IV, and V shall be to pay Executive, pursuant to the Company s then-effective Plans, a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations determined as of the Termination
Date. The remaining provisions of this Agreement (including the restrictive covenants in Article VIII) shall continue to apply.    4.9
 Termination by the Company for Disability . If the Company (or Disaggregated Entity, if applicable) terminates Executive s employment by reason of Executive s Disability during a Post-Change Period, Imminent Control Change Period
that culminates in a Change Date, Post-Significant Acquisition Period or Post-Disaggregation Period, the Company s sole obligation to Executive under Articles II, IV, and V shall be as follows, and such obligations shall be reduced by amounts
paid or provided by the Disaggregated Entity:    (a) to pay Executive, a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of amounts
specified in Section 4.1(a)(i) and (ii) determined as of the Termination Date,    (b) to pay Executive the amounts described
in Section 4.1(a)(iii) in accordance with the applicable deferred compensation plan and Executive s distribution election thereunder as of the Termination Date (or, if no affirmative election is in effect as of such date, the default election
as of such date) and    (c) to provide Executive disability and other benefits after the Termination Date that are not less
than the most favorable of such benefits then available under Plans of the Company to disabled peer executives of the Company in effect immediately before the Termination Date.  
 The remaining provisions of this Agreement (including the restrictive covenants in Article VIII) shall continue to apply.  
 4.10  Upon Death . If Executive s employment is terminated by reason of Executive s death during a Post-Change Period, Imminent
Control Change Period that culminates in a Change Date, Post-Significant Acquisition Period or Post-Disaggregation Period, the Company s sole obligations to Executive and Executive s Beneficiary under Articles II, IV, and V shall be as
follows, and such obligations shall be reduced by amounts paid or provided by the Disaggregated Entity:    (a) to pay
Executive s Beneficiary, pursuant to the Company s then-effective Plans or, if the timing of payment is not governed by the terms of a Plan, within 30 days after the date of Executive s death, a lump-sum cash amount equal to all
Accrued Obligations; and    (b) to provide Executive s Beneficiary survivor and other benefits that are not less than
the most favorable of such benefits then available under Plans of the Company to surviving families of peer executives of the Company in effect immediately before the Executive s death, including retiree health care coverage under any Welfare
Plan of the Company that provides such coverage without regard to whether the Executive had satisfied the eligibility requirements for such coverage as of the date of his or her death.  
      31  

4.11  Sole and Exclusive Obligations .   The obligations of the Company under this
Agreement with respect to any Termination of Employment of the Executive during the Post-Change Period, Imminent Control Change Period, Post-Significant Acquisition Period, or Post-Disaggregation Period shall, except as provided in Section 4.2,
supersede any severance obligations of the Company in any other plan of the Company or agreement between Executive and the Company, including, without limitations, the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan or any other plan or
agreement (including an offer of employment or employment contract) of the Company or any Affiliates which provides for severance benefits. In the event of any inconsistency, ambiguity or conflict between the terms of such other plan of the Company
or agreement between Executive and the Company and this Agreement with respect to any severance obligations of the Company (other than obligations with respect to credited service under the SERP in any agreement other than a prior Change in Control
Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.     Article V.   
  Certain Additional Payments by the Company   
 5.1  No Excise Tax Gross-Up .  
 (a) If it is determined by the Company s independent auditors that any monetary or other benefit received or deemed
received by Executive from the Company or any Affiliate thereof pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, whether or not in connection with a Change in Control (such monetary or other benefits collectively, the   Potential Parachute
Payments  ), is or would, if paid, become subject to any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax under any United States federal, state, local or other law (such excise tax and all such similar taxes collectively,
  Excise Taxes  ), then the total Potential Parachute Payments shall be reduced such that the value of the aggregate Potential Parachute Payments shall be one dollar ($1) less than the maximum amount which the Executive may receive
without becoming subject to Excise Taxes (the   Capped Amount  ), and only the Capped Amount shall be paid. The tax (and interest) imposed under Section 409A of the Code shall not be  any similar tax  for purposes of this
Agreement.    (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.1(a), if receipt of the total Potential Parachute Payments without reduction
would leave Executive with a greater amount, after payment of Taxes and Excise Taxes with respect thereto, than payment of the Capped Amount after payment of Taxes with respect thereto, then the reduction described in Section 5.1(a) shall not be
made.    (c) In the event payment of the Capped Amount is to be made, the Potential Parachute Payments shall be reduced or
eliminated upon notice by the Executive in writing delivered to the Company within 10 days of his receipt of the Company Certificate (or, if later within 10 days after his delivery of the Executive Certificate), or if the Executive fails to so
notify the Company, then as the Company shall reasonably determine, with regard for avoiding the imposition of taxes and interest payments under  
      32  

Section 409A of the Code, if possible, so that under the bases of calculations set forth in the Company Certificate (or, if applicable, the Executive Certificate), there will be no amount subject
to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. Such reduction shall be applied, to the extent necessary, first to any cash severance payments hereunder, followed by any Annual Incentive payable for the year in which the Termination of Employment
occurs, followed by any Performance Shares payable for such year or preceding years and then to any Options.    (d) The
determination of the Company s independent auditors described in Section 5.1(a), including the detailed calculations of the amounts of the Potential Parachute Payments, the Capped Amount, the amount of Excise Taxes and Taxes and the assumptions
relating thereto, shall be set forth in a written certificate of such auditors (the   Company Certificate  ) delivered to Executive. Executive or the Company may at any time request the preparation and delivery to Executive of a
Company Certificate. The Company shall cause the Company Certificate to be delivered to Executive as soon as reasonably possible after such request.  
 5.2  Determination by Executive .  
 (a) If (i) the Company shall fail to deliver a Company Certificate to Executive within 30 days after its receipt of his written
request therefor, or (ii) at any time after Executive s receipt of a Company Certificate, Executive disputes any portion of the Company Certificate, then Executive may elect to deliver a determination (  Executive Certificate  )
to the Company, setting forth Executive s determination as to whether Section 5.1(a) applies, and if so, the amount of the Capped Amount. If the Executive Certificate specifies that the Company is required to pay an amount less than the amount
specified in the Company Certificate, setting forth in detail how such lesser amount was determined, the Executive Certificate shall be controlling for all purposes. If the Executive Certificate specifies that the Company is required to pay an
amount greater than the amount specified in the Company Certificate, the Executive Certificate shall specify the full amount of the Potential Parachute Payments determined by Executive (together with the detailed calculations of the Capped Amount,
amounts of Excise Taxes and Taxes and the assumptions relating thereto) and shall be accompanied by an Executive Counsel Opinion (as defined in Section 5.3) regarding the applicability or inapplicability (as appropriate) of the reduction described
in Section 5.1(a) (such written notice and opinion collectively, the   Executive s Determination  ). Within 30 days after delivery of an Executive s Determination to the Company, the Company shall either (i) pay
Executive the full amount specified in the Executive s Determination (less the portion thereof, if any, previously paid to Executive by the Company) or (ii) deliver to Executive a Company Certificate and a Company Counsel Opinion (as defined in
Section 5.3), and pay Executive the amount specified in such Company Certificate. If for any reason the Company fails to comply with the preceding sentence, the amounts specified in the Executive s Determination shall be controlling for all
purposes.  
      33  

(b) If Executive does not request a Company Certificate, the Company does not
deliver a Company Certificate to Executive, and Executive does not deliver an Executive Certificate to the Company, then the Potential Parachute Payments shall be made without regard to Section 5.1(a).  
 5.3  Opinion of Counsel .  Executive Counsel Opinion  means an opinion of nationally recognized executive compensation
counsel to the effect (i) that the Capped Amount determined by Executive pursuant to Section 5.2 is the amount that a court of competent jurisdiction, based on a final judgment not subject to further appeal, is most likely to decide to have been
calculated in accordance with this Article and applicable law and (ii) if the Company has previously delivered a Company Certificate to Executive, that there is no reasonable basis or no substantial authority for the calculation of the Capped Amount
set forth in the Company Certificate.   Company Counsel Opinion   means an opinion of nationally recognized executive compensation counsel to the effect that the amount of the Capped Amount set forth in the Company Certificate is
the amount that a court of competent jurisdiction, based on a final judgment not subject to further appeal, is most likely to decide to have been calculated in accordance with this Article and applicable law, and that there is no substantial
authority for the calculation set forth in the Executive s Certificate.    Article VI.   
  Expenses, Interest and Dispute Resolution   
 6.1  Enforcement and Late Payments .  
 (a) If, after the Agreement Date, Executive incurs reasonable legal fees or other expenses (including arbitration costs and
expenses under Section 6.3) in an effort to secure, preserve, or obtain benefits under this Agreement, the Company shall, regardless of the outcome of such effort, reimburse Executive (in accordance with Section 6.1(b)) for such fees and expenses.
   (b) Reimbursement of legal fees and expenses shall be made on a current basis, promptly after Executive s written
submission of a request for reimbursement together with evidence that such fees and expenses were incurred.    (c) If
Executive does not prevail (after exhaustion of all available judicial remedies) in respect of a claim by Executive or by the Company hereunder, and the Company establishes before a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence
that Executive had no reasonable basis for Executive s claim hereunder, or for Executive s response to the Company s claim hereunder, or that Executive acted in bad faith, no further reimbursement for legal fees and expenses shall be
due to Executive in respect of such claim and Executive shall refund any amounts previously reimbursed hereunder with respect to such claim.  
      34  

6.2  Interest . If the Company does not pay any cash amount due to Executive under this
Agreement within three business days after such amount first became due and owing, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date it became due and owing until the date of payment at an annual rate equal to 200 basis points above the base
commercial lending rate published in  The Wall Street Journal  in effect from time to time during the period of such nonpayment.    6.3
 Arbitration . Any dispute, controversy or claim between the parties hereto arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement (other than disputes related to Article V or to an alleged breach of any covenant contained in
Article VIII) or any breach or alleged breach thereof, or any benefit or alleged benefit hereunder, shall be settled by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, before an impartial arbitrator pursuant to the rules and regulations of the American
Arbitration Association (  AAA  ) pertaining to the arbitration of commercial disputes. Either party may invoke the right to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be selected by means of the parties striking alternatively from a panel of
seven arbitrators supplied by the Chicago office of AAA. The arbitrator shall have the authority to interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement, consistent with Section 10.12 below. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final
and binding upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in the highest court of a forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne according to Section 6.1. No arbitration shall be
commenced after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based upon such subject matter would be barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere
in this Agreement, either party may bring an action in the District Court of Cook County, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, if jurisdiction there lies, in order to maintain the status quo ante of the parties.
The  status quo ante  is defined as the last peaceable, uncontested status between the parties. However, neither the party bringing the action nor the party defending the action thereby waives its right to arbitration of any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of or in connection or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, either party may seek relief in the form of specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce the decision of the arbitrator. The parties agree that in any arbitration commenced pursuant to this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to such discovery (including
depositions, requests for the production of documents and interrogatories) as would be available in a federal district court pursuant to Rules 26 through 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event that either party fails to comply with
its discovery obligations hereunder, the arbitrator shall have full power and authority to compel disclosure or impose sanctions to the full extent of Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
  Article VII.      No
Set-off or Mitigation     7.1  No Set-off by Company . Executive s right to receive when due the payments and other benefits
provided for under this Agreement is absolute, unconditional and subject to no setoff, counterclaim or legal or equitable defense; provided, however that the Company shall  
      35  

have no further obligation to pay or provide severance benefits under Article II, Article IV or Article V if at any time it determines, in accordance with the procedural requirements in Section
3.3, that in the course of his or her employment the Executive engaged in conduct described in Section 3.3(a)(iii) or the last clause of Section 3.3(a)(iv), and all incentive compensation paid or payable hereunder shall be subject to any officer
compensation recoupment policy as in effect on the Change Date. Time is of the essence in the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement. Any claim which the Company may have against Executive, whether for a breach of this
Agreement or otherwise, shall be brought in a separate action or proceeding and not as part of any action or proceeding brought by Executive to enforce any rights against the Company under this Agreement.  
 7.2  No Mitigation . Executive shall not have any duty to mitigate the amounts payable by the Company under this Agreement by seeking new
employment or self-employment following termination. Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, all amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid without reduction regardless of any amounts of salary, compensation or
other amounts which may be paid or payable to Executive as the result of Executive s employment by another unaffiliated employer or self-employment.  
  Article VIII.   
  Restrictive Covenants     8.1
 Confidential Information . The Executive acknowledges that in the course of performing services for the Companies and Affiliates, he or she may create (alone or with others), learn of, have access to and receive Confidential Information.
Executive covenants and agrees that he or she will not divulge or make use of any Confidential Information of the Company other than to the extent required in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For this purpose,  Confidential
Information  shall mean any information, ideas, processes, methods, designs, devices, inventions, data, techniques, models and other information developed or used by the Company and not generally known in the relevant trade or industry relating
to any of the Company s products, services, businesses, operations, employees, or customers or suppliers with whom Executive has dealt, whether in tangible or intangible form, which gives the Company a competitive advantage and from which
economic value could be derived by its disclosure, or of third parties which the Company is obligated to keep confidential, or which was learned, discovered, developed, conceived, originated or prepared during or as a result of your performance of
any services on behalf of the Company, and which falls within any of the following general categories:    (a) information
relating to trade secrets of the Company or any of its customers or suppliers;    (c) information relating to existing or
contemplated products, services, technology, designs, processes, formulae, algorithms, research or product developments of the Company or any of its customers or suppliers;  
      36  

(d) information relating to business plans or strategies, sales or marketing

 (e) information subject to protection under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as adopted by the State of Illinois, or to any
comparable protection afforded by applicable law; or    (f) any other confidential information which the Company or any of
its customers or suppliers may reasonably have the right to protect by patent, copyright or by keeping it secret and confidential.  
 8.2  Non-Competition . During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Termination Date,
whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation, Executive hereby agrees that without the written consent of the Company Executive shall not at any time, directly or indirectly:  
 (a) participate in, work for, or provide services to any person or entity that is, or is actively planning to be, a
 Competitive Business.  The term  Competitive Business  shall mean any business (however organized or conducted) which employed Executive or to which Executive provided services that competes with a business in which the
Company is engaged, or that has interests that are materially adverse to the Company, or in which the Company is actively planning to engage, and in which Executive was employed or to which Executive provided services at any time during the last
twelve months of Executive s employment by the Company; or    (a) act in any capacity for or with any Competitive
Business, or for or with any of their agents, if in such capacity Executive would, because of the nature of his or her role with such Competitive Business and Executive s knowledge of the Company s Confidential Information (as defined
below), inevitably use and/or disclose any of the Company s Confidential Information in his work for, or on behalf of, the Competitive Business or its agent.  
 8.3  Non-Solicitation . During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the second anniversary of any Termination Date,
whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly:  
 (a) other than in connection with the good-faith performance of his or her duties as an officer of the Company, induce or
attempt to persuade any individual who, at any time during the last twelve months of Executive s employment with the Company, was an employee, agent (including consultants) or independent contractor of the Company to terminate such employment,
agency or contracting relationship;  
      37  

(a) have any communications with any such individual regarding the possibility of
the individual entering into an employment, agency or other contracting relationship with a party other than the Company;  
 (b) have any other involvement in the employment or retention of any such individual by any party other than the Company; or
   (c) interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to disrupt the relationship of the Company with, or endeavor to entice away from
the Company, any person or entity who or which at any time during the last twelve months of Executive s employment was or is, to Executive s knowledge, a material customer or material supplier of, or maintained a material business
relationship with, the Company.    8.4  Intellectual Property . During the period of Executive s employment with the Company and
any Affiliate, and thereafter upon the Company s request, whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation, Executive shall disclose immediately to the Company all ideas, inventions
and business plans that he or she makes, conceives, discovers or develops alone or with others during the course of his or her employment with the Company or during the one year period following Executive s Termination Date, including any
inventions, modifications, discoveries, developments, improvements, computer programs, processes, products or procedures (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights)
(  Work Product  ) that: (i) relate to the business of the Company or any customer or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by the Company or
that may be used in relation therewith; or (ii) result from tasks assigned to Executive by the Company; or (iii) result from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by
the Company. Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a  work made for hire  within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the
  Act  ). If and to the extent that any such Work Product is not a  work made for hire  within the meaning of the Act, Executive hereby assigns to the Company all right, title and interest in and to the Work Product,
and all copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of
Executive.    (a) The Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for
which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executive s own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Company s business, or
(b) to the Company s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company.  
 (b) Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his or her employment and at
any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company, execute all such documents and perform all such acts as the  
      38  

Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent,
copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to prosecute or defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any
opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection, or otherwise in respect of the Work Product.  
 (c) In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executive s execution as provided in
subsection (b) above, whether because of Executive s physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his or
her agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his or her behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance and protection of letters patent, copyright
and other intellectual property protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.    8.5
 Reasonableness of Restrictive Covenants .    (a) Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained in Sections 8.1,
8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 are reasonable in the scope of the activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are reasonably necessary to protect the Company s
legitimate interests in its Confidential Information and in its relationships with its employees, customers and suppliers. Executive further acknowledges such covenants are essential elements of this Agreement and that, but for such covenants, the
Company would not have entered into this Agreement.    (b) The Company and Executive have each consulted with their
respective legal counsel and have been advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants. Executive acknowledges that Executive s observance of the covenants contained in Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 will not deprive
Executive of the ability to earn a livelihood or to support his or her dependents.    8.6  Right to Injunction; Survival of
Undertakings .    (a) In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the
necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which the Company would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his or her
obligations under such Sections. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of such Sections would irreparably injure the Company. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he or she breaches any of the provisions of such Sections, the
Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may  
      39  

be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive
hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach.  
 (b) The provisions of Sections 8.1-8.4 hereof are, and shall be construed as, independent covenants, and no claimed or actual
breach of any contractual or legal duty by the Company shall excuse or terminate Executive s obligations under this Agreement or preclude the Company from obtaining injunctive relief for Executive s violation, or threatened violation, of
any of those provisions.    (c) The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court
located within the Northern District of Illinois and irrevocably agree that all, actions or proceedings arising out of or related to an alleged breach of any covenant under article VIII to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be litigated in such courts, and each of the parties waive any and all objections to jurisdiction that they may have based on improper venue or forum non conveniens.  
 (d) If a court determines that any of the covenants included in this Article VIII is unenforceable in whole or in part, it is
the intention of the parties that such court shall have the power to modify any such provision, to the extent necessary to render the provision enforceable (for the maximum duration and scope permissible), and such provision as so modified shall be
enforced.    (e) All of the provisions of this Article VIII shall survive any Termination of Employment without regard to (i)
the reasons for such termination or (ii) the expiration of the Agreement Term.    (f) The Company shall have no further
obligation to pay or provide severance or benefits under Article II, Article IV, or Article V if a court determines that the Executive has breached any covenant in this Article VIII.  
  Article IX.   
  Non-Exclusivity of Rights   
 9.1  Other Rights . Except as expressly provided in Section 4.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent or limit
Executive s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other Plans provided by the Company and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall this Agreement limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have
under any other agreements with the Company. Amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any Plan and any other payment or benefit required by law at or after the Termination Date shall be payable in
accordance with such Plan or applicable law except as expressly modified by this Agreement.  
      40  

9.2  No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee the right
of Executive to continue in employment, and the Company retains the right to terminate the Executive s employment at any time for any reason or for no reason.  
  Article X.   
  Miscellaneous     10.1  No
Assignability . This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the

attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable under this Agreement shall be void.    10.7  Severability . If any one or more
Articles, Sections or other portions of this Agreement are declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any Article, Section or other portion not so declared
to be unlawful or invalid. Any Article, Section or other portion so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall be construed so as to effectuate the terms of such Article, Section or other portion to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful
and valid.    10.8  Amendments  This Agreement shall not be amended or modified except by written instrument executed by the

regulation.    10.16  Section 409A . This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition
of additional taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code ( 409A Penalties ). In the event the terms of this Agreement would subject Executive to 409A Penalties, the Company and Executive shall cooperate diligently to amend the
terms of the Agreement to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. The payments to Executive pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent possible, under either the
separation pay exemption pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(4), and for purposes of the separation pay exemption, each installment paid to Executive
under Section 4 shall be considered a separate payment. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if on the date of Executive s Termination Date, (i) the Company is a publicly traded corporation and (ii) Executive is a
 specified employee,  as defined in Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent any amount payable under this Agreement constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that
under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (A) the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date or (B) the date of
Executive s death.    10.17  No Waiver . Executive s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this
Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or any other provision of this Agreement. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision, and any waiver of any default in any such provision
shall not be deemed a waiver of any later default thereof or of any other provision.    10.18  Entire Agreement . This Agreement, as
amended and restated effective October     , 2016, contains the entire understanding of Company and Executive with respect to its subject matter.  
      43  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Executive and Exelon Corporation have executed this Change in Control
Employment Agreement effective as of                     , 2016.
