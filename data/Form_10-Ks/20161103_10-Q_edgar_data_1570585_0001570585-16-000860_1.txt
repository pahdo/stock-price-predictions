(  1  )      Basis of Presentation 
    
  Liberty Global plc (  Liberty Global  ) is a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales. In these notes, the terms  we,   our,   our company  and  us  may refer, as the context requires, to   Liberty Global   or collectively to   Liberty Global   and its subsidiaries. We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and other communications services to consumers and businesses, with consolidated operations at   September 30, 2016   in more than   30   countries.  
    
  In Europe, we provide consumer and business-to-business (  B2B  ) services in (i) the United Kingdom (  U.K.  ) and Ireland through Virgin Media Inc. (  Virgin Media  ), (ii) the Netherlands through Ziggo Group Holding B.V. (  Ziggo Group Holding  ), (iii) Germany through Unitymedia GmbH (  Unitymedia  ), (iv) Belgium through Telenet Group Holding N.V. (  Telenet  ), a   57.5%  -owned subsidiary, and (v)   seven   other European countries through UPC Holding B.V. (  UPC Holding  ).   Virgin Media  ,   Ziggo Group Holding  ,   Unitymedia   and   UPC Holding   are each wholly-owned subsidiaries of   Liberty Global  . The operations of   Virgin Media  ,   Ziggo Group Holding  ,   Unitymedia  ,   Telenet   and   UPC Holding   are collectively referred to herein as the    European Operations Division  .  
    
  In addition, we provide consumer and   B2B   services in (i)   18   countries, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Cable   Wireless Communications Limited (formerly known as Cable   Wireless Communications Plc) (  CWC  ), (ii) Chile through our wholly-owned subsidiary VTR.com SpA (  VTR  ) and (iii) Puerto Rico through Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC (  Liberty Puerto Rico  ), an entity in which we hold a   60.0%   ownership interest.   CWC   also provides (a)   B2B   services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (b) wholesale services over its sub-sea and terrestrial networks that connect over   30   markets in that region.   CWC   owns less than 100% of certain of its consolidated subsidiaries, including Cable   Wireless Panama, SA (  CWC Panama  ) (a   49.0%  -owned entity that owns most of our operations in Panama), The Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (  CWC BTC  ) (a   49.0%  -owned entity that owns all of our operations in the Bahamas), Cable   Wireless Jamaica Limited (  CWC Jamaica  ) (an   82.0%  -owned entity that owns the majority of our operations in Jamaica) and Cable   Wireless Barbados Limited (  CWC Barbados  ) (an   81.1%  -owned entity that owns the majority of our operations in Barbados). The operations of   CWC  ,   VTR   and   Liberty Puerto Rico   are collectively referred to herein as the    LiLAC Division  .   
    
  Effective August 3, 2016, in connection with the pending formation of the   Dutch JV   (as defined and described in note   3  ), we began accounting for   Ziggo Group Holding   and its subsidiaries and Ziggo Sport Totaal (  Ziggo Sport   and, together with   Ziggo Group Holding   and its subsidiaries, the   Dutch JV Entities  ) as held for sale. Ziggo Sport operates premium sports channels in the Netherlands. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are included in assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale, respectively, in our September 30, 2016 condensed consolidated balance sheet. Consistent with the applicable guidance, we have not reflected similar reclassifications in our condensed consolidated statements of operations or our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information, see note   3  .  
    
  On July 1, 2015, we completed the approved steps of the    LiLAC Transaction    whereby we (i) reclassified our then outstanding Class A, Class B and Class C   Liberty Global   ordinary shares into corresponding classes of new   Liberty Global   ordinary shares (collectively, the   Liberty Global Shares  ) and (ii) capitalized a portion of our share premium account and distributed as a dividend (or a  bonus issue  under   U.K.   law) our LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the   LiLAC Shares  ). In these notes, the term    Old Liberty Global Shares    refers to our previously-outstanding Class A, Class B and Class C   Liberty Global   ordinary shares. The impact of the   LiLAC Transaction   on our capitalization and earnings or loss per share (  EPS  ) presentation has been reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements prospectively from July 1, 2015. Accordingly, (a) our net earnings (loss) attributed to   Liberty Global Shares   and   LiLAC Shares   relates to the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the three months ended September 30, 2015 and (b) our net loss attributed to   Old Liberty Global Shares   relates to the six months ended June 30, 2015. 
    
  The   Liberty Global Shares   and the   LiLAC Shares   are tracking shares. Tracking shares are intended by the issuing company 
  to reflect or  track  the economic performance of a particular business or  group,  rather than the economic performance of the 
  company as a whole. The   Liberty Global Shares   and the   LiLAC Shares   are intended to track the economic performance of the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group  , respectively (each as defined and described below). While the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, neither group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking shares have no direct claim to the group s assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking

shares are shareholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors, and are subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation. We and our subsidiaries each continue to be responsible for our respective liabilities. Holders of   Liberty Global Shares  ,   LiLAC Shares   and any other of our capital shares designated as ordinary shares from time to time will continue to be subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both   Liberty Global Shares   and   LiLAC Shares  . 
    
  The    LiLAC Group    comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed to it (i) LGE Coral Holdco Limited (  LGE Coral  ) and its subsidiaries, which include   CWC  , (ii) VTR Finance B.V. (  VTR Finance  ) and its subsidiaries, which include   VTR  , (iii) Lila Chile Holding B.V. (  Lila Chile Holding  ), which is the parent entity of   VTR Finance  , (iv) LiLAC Holdings Inc. (  LiLAC Holdings  ) and its subsidiaries, which include   Liberty Puerto Rico  , and (v) prior to July 1, 2015, the costs associated with certain corporate employees of   Liberty Global   that are exclusively focused on the management of the   LiLAC Group   (the   LiLAC Corporate Costs  ). Effective July 1, 2015, these corporate employees were transferred to   LiLAC Holdings  . The    Liberty Global Group    comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities not attributed to the   LiLAC Group  , including   Virgin Media  ,   Ziggo Group Holding  ,   Unitymedia  ,   Telenet  ,   UPC Holding  , our corporate entities (excluding   LiLAC Holdings  ) and certain other less significant entities.  
    
  For additional information regarding our tracking share capital structure, including unaudited attributed financial information of the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group  , see Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
    
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (  U.S. GAAP  ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information required by   U.S. GAAP   or Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our   2015   consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with   U.S. GAAP   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, programming and copyright costs, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair value measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities, useful lives of long-lived assets, share-based compensation and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Unless otherwise indicated, ownership percentages and convenience translations into United States (  U.S.  ) dollars are calculated as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the reclassification of deferred financing costs from other long-term assets to long-term debt and capital lease obligations and the reclassification of certain costs between operating and SG A expenses. For additional information regarding the change in the classification of deferred financing costs, see    Accounting Changes    in note   2  . 

(  2  )      Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Accounting Changes 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (  ASU  ) No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   (  ASU 2015-03  ), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. For public entities,   ASU 2015-03   is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted   ASU 2015-03   on January 1, 2016 and, accordingly, deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction of debt in our

  (unaudited) 

September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the adoption of   ASU 2015-03  , we presented deferred financing costs in other assets, net.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the   FASB   issued   ASU   No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (  ASU 2014-09  ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.   ASU 2014-09  , as amended by   ASU   No. 2015-14, will replace existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods that begin after December 15, 2016. This new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We will adopt   ASU 2014-09   effective January 1, 2018 using the cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect that   ASU 2014-09   will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  In February 2016, the   FASB   issued   ASU   No. 2016-02,   Leases   (  ASU 2016-02  ), which, for most leases, will result in lessees recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet with additional disclosures about leasing arrangements.   ASU 2016-02   requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach also includes a number of optional practical expedients an entity may elect to apply.   ASU 2016-02   is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that   ASU 2016-02   will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the   FASB   issued   ASU   No. 2016-09,   Compensation         Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (  ASU 2016-09  ), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification within the statement of cash flows.   ASU 2016-09   is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.   ASU 2016-09   will result in the reclassification of cash flows from excess tax benefits of share-based compensation from financing activities to operating activities. Further, the accumulation of excess tax benefits will no longer need to be recognized within additional paid-in capital or included as an adjustment within the computation of earnings per share under   ASU 2016-09  .  
    
  In June 2016, the   FASB   issued   ASU   No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments       Credit Losses   (  ASU 2016-13  ), which changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net earnings.   ASU 2016-13   is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that   ASU 2016-13   will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

(  3  )     Acquisition and Joint Venture Transactions 
    
  Pending Joint Venture Transaction 
  On February 15, 2016, we and Liberty Global Europe Holding B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Contribution and Transfer Agreement (the   Contribution Agreement  ) with Vodafone Group plc (  Vodafone  ) and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the   Contribution Agreement  , our company and   Vodafone   agreed to form a   50  :  50   joint venture (the   Dutch JV  ), which will combine   Ziggo Group Holding   and   Ziggo Sport   with   Vodafone   s mobile businesses in the Netherlands (  Vodafone NL  ) to create a national unified communications provider in the Netherlands with complementary strengths across video, broadband, mobile and   B2B   services. In our segment presentation,   Ziggo Group Holding   is separately reported as    The Netherlands    and   Ziggo Sport   is included in our    Corporate and Other    category. 
  At the closing of the transaction contemplated by the   Contribution Agreement  ,   Vodafone   will pay to our company an equalization payment equal to approximately    1.0 billion     (  $1.1 billion  ), as adjusted for the defined net debt of   Ziggo Group Holding   and   Vodafone NL   at the time of closing and certain working capital adjustments.   Ziggo Group Holding   will be contributed to the   Dutch JV   together with its outstanding third-party debt, while   Ziggo Sport   and   Vodafone   s business in the Netherlands will be contributed on a debt and cash free basis.

  (unaudited) 

As further described in note   7  , certain subsidiaries of   Ziggo Group Holding   entered into various debt financing arrangements in anticipation of the formation of the   Dutch JV  . The parties currently expect to make a pro rata distribution of the net proceeds from the additional debt to our company and   Vodafone  . The   Dutch JV   will be required to make regular cash distributions to its shareholders on a pro rata basis equal to the unrestricted cash held by the   Dutch JV   (subject to the   Dutch JV   maintaining a minimum amount of cash and complying with the terms of its financing arrangements). As an ongoing operation, it is intended that the   Dutch JV   will be funded solely from its net cash flow from operations and third-party financing. This transaction will not trigger any of   Ziggo Group Holding   s requirements under its debt agreements to redeem its outstanding debt pursuant to applicable change in control provisions. 
    
  Pursuant to the Framework Agreement that we expect to enter into in connection with the closing of the   Dutch JV  , our company and   Vodafone   will provide certain services to the   Dutch JV  . 
    
  Following completion of the transaction, we expect to account for our   50%   interest in the   Dutch JV   as an equity method investment, and we expect to attribute our   50%   interest in the   Dutch JV   to the   Liberty Global Group  .  
    
  The consummation of the transaction contemplated by the   Contribution Agreement   is subject to certain conditions, including competition clearance by the European Commission. On August 3, 2016, the European Commission approved the transaction subject to the divestment by   Vodafone   of its fixed-line business in the Netherlands. It is anticipated that the transaction contemplated by the   Contribution Agreement   will close around the end of 2016. The   Contribution Agreement   also includes customary termination rights, including a right of the parties to terminate the transaction if it has not closed by August 15, 2017.  
    
  Effective August 3, 2016, in connection with conditional approval from the European Commission, we began accounting for the   Dutch JV Entities   as held for sale. Accordingly, effective August 3, 2016, we no longer depreciate or amortize the long-lived assets of the   Dutch JV Entities  . We do not present these entities as discontinued operations as this transaction does not represent a strategic shift for   Liberty Global  . Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the aggregate carrying value of the   Dutch JV Entities   was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustments to the carrying values of these entities were necessary. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale at   September 30, 2016   are summarized below (in millions):

  2016 Acquisitions 
    
  CWC  .   On   May 16, 2016  , pursuant to a scheme of arrangement and following shareholder approvals, we acquired   CWC   for shares of   Liberty Global   (the   CWC Acquisition  ). Under the terms of the transaction,   CWC   shareholders received in the aggregate:   31,607,008   Class A   Liberty Global Shares  ,   77,379,774   Class C   Liberty Global Shares  ,   3,648,513   Class A   LiLAC Shares   and   8,939,316   Class C   LiLAC Shares  . Further, in accordance with the scheme of arrangement and immediately prior to the acquisition,   CWC   declared a special cash dividend (the   Special Dividend  ) to its shareholders in the amount of    0.03   (  $0.04   at the transaction date) per   CWC   share. The   Special Dividend   was paid to   CWC   shareholders promptly following the closing and the payment, together with fees and expenses related to the acquisition, was funded with   CWC   liquidity, including incremental debt borrowings, and   LiLAC Group   corporate liquidity. We acquired   CWC   in order to achieve certain financial, operational and strategic benefits through the integration of   CWC   with our existing operations in the   LiLAC Group  . 
    
  The   CWC Acquisition   triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which   CWC   operates. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Seychelles and the Cayman Islands, have not completed their review of the   CWC Acquisition   or granted their approval. While we expect to receive all outstanding approvals, such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on   CWC   s operations and financial condition. 
    
  For accounting purposes, the   CWC Acquisition   was treated as the acquisition of   CWC   by   Liberty Global  . In this regard, the equity and cash consideration paid to acquire   CWC   is set forth below (in millions):

We have accounted for the   CWC Acquisition   using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of   CWC   based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. The preliminary opening balance sheet is subject to adjustment based on our final assessment of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities. Most items in the valuation process remain open and are subject to change upon finalization of the valuation process. A summary of the purchase price and the preliminary opening balance sheet of   CWC   at the   May 16, 2016   acquisition date is presented in the following table (in millions):    

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The goodwill recognized in connection with the   CWC Acquisition   is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take advantage of   CWC   s existing advanced broadband communications and sub-sea and terrestrial networks to gain immediate access to potential customers and (ii) synergies that are expected to be achieved through the integration of   CWC   with other operations in the   LiLAC Group  .  
       
           (b) 
    Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. At May 16, 2016, the preliminary assessment of the weighted average useful life of     CWC   s intangible assets was approximately   eight years  .  
       
           (c) 
    Represents the aggregate fair value of the noncontrolling interests in   CWC   s subsidiaries as of   May 16, 2016  . 
       
           (d) 
    Excludes direct acquisition costs of   $117.0 million  , which are included in impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
       
  Following completion of the   CWC Acquisition  , we attributed   CWC   to the   LiLAC Group  , with the   Liberty Global Group   being granted an inter-group interest in the   LiLAC Group   representing the fair value (as determined by our board of directors) of the   Liberty Global Shares   issued as part of the purchase consideration. On July 1, 2016, we distributed (as a bonus issue)   117,425,359     LiLAC Shares   to   Liberty Global Group   shareholders on a pro-rata basis (the   LiLAC Distribution  ), thereby eliminating the   Liberty Global Group  's inter-group interest in the   LiLAC Group  . The   LiLAC Distribution   was accounted for prospectively effective July 1, 2016.  
    
  BASE  . On   February 11, 2016  , pursuant to a definitive agreement and following regulatory approval,   Telenet   acquired Telenet Group BVBA, formerly known as BASE Company NV (  BASE  ), for a cash purchase price of    1,321.9 million   (  $1,497.7 million   at the transaction date) (the   BASE Acquisition  ).   BASE   is the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium. We expect that the   BASE Acquisition   will provide   Telenet   with cost-effective long-term mobile access to effectively compete for future growth opportunities in the Belgium mobile market. The   BASE Acquisition   was funded through a combination of    1.0 billion   (  $1.1 billion   at the transaction date) of new debt facilities and existing liquidity of   Telenet  . The acquisition was approved by the European Commission subject to   Telenet   s agreement to divest both the JIM Mobile prepaid customer base and   BASE   s   50%   stake in Viking Co NV (  Viking  ) to MEDIALAAN NV. In February 2016,   Telenet   completed the sale of its stake in   Viking  . The divestiture of the JIM Mobile prepaid customer base is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2017.

We have accounted for the   BASE Acquisition   using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of   BASE   based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. The preliminary opening balance sheet is subject to adjustment based on our final assessment of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities. Although most items in the valuation process remain open, the items with the highest likelihood of changing upon finalization of the valuation process include     property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets associated with mobile spectrum, customer relationships and trademarks and income taxes. A summary of the purchase price and the preliminary opening balance sheet of   BASE   at the   February 11, 2016   acquisition date is presented in the following table (in millions):  

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The goodwill recognized in connection with the   BASE Acquisition   is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take advantage of   BASE   s existing mobile network to gain immediate access to potential customers and (ii) synergies that are expected to be achieved through the integration of   BASE   with   Telenet  .  
       
           (b) 
    As of   February 11, 2016  , the weighted average useful life of   BASE   s mobile spectrum was approximately   11 years  .  
       
           (c) 
    As of   February 11, 2016  , the weighted average useful life of   BASE   s customer relationships was approximately   seven years  .  
       
           (d) 
    As of   February 11, 2016  , the weighted average useful life of   BASE   s trademarks was approximately   20 years  .  
       
           (e) 
    Excludes direct acquisition costs of   $17.1 million  , including   $7.1 million   incurred during 2016, which are included in impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.  
       
  2015 Acquisition  
    
  On   June 3, 2015  , pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with the parent entity of Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Company Inc., dba Choice Cable TV (  Choice  ) and following regulatory approval, one of our subsidiaries, together with investment funds affiliated with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively,   Searchlight  ), acquired   100%   of   Choice   (the   Choice Acquisition  ).   Choice   is a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico. We acquired   Choice   in order to achieve certain financial, operational and strategic benefits through the integration of   Choice   with   Liberty Puerto Rico  . The combined business is   60.0%  -owned by our company and   40.0%  -owned by   Searchlight  . 
  The purchase price for   Choice   of   $276.4 million   was funded through (i)   Liberty Puerto Rico   s incremental debt borrowings, net of discount and fees, of   $259.1 million  , (ii) cash of   $10.5 million   and (iii) an equity contribution from   Searchlight   of   $6.8 million  .

We have accounted for the   Choice Acquisition   using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price was allocated to the acquired identifiable net assets of   Choice   based on assessments of their respective fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. A summary of the purchase price and opening balance sheet of   Choice   at the   June 3, 2015   acquisition date is presented in the following table. The opening balance sheet presented below reflects our final purchase price allocation (in millions): 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The goodwill recognized in connection with the   Choice Acquisition   is primarily attributable to (i) the ability to take advantage of   Choice   s existing advanced broadband communications network to gain immediate access to potential customers and (ii) synergies that are expected to be achieved through the integration of   Choice   with   Liberty Puerto Rico  . 
       
           (b) 
    Amount primarily includes intangible assets related to customer relationships. As of June 3, 2015, the weighted average useful life of   Choice   s intangible assets was approximately   ten years  . 
       
           (c) 
    Excludes direct acquisition costs of   $8.5 million   incurred through December 31, 2015, which were included in impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
       
  Pro Forma Information 
  The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated operating results give effect to (i) the   CWC Acquisition  , (ii) the   BASE Acquisition   and (iii) the   Choice Acquisition  , as if they had been completed as of January 1, 2015. These pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on such date. The pro forma adjustments are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. In the following table, we present the revenue that is attributed to the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   as if such revenue had been attributed to each group at the beginning of each period presented. However, our presentation of net earnings (loss) and basic and diluted earnings (loss)     per share attributed to (a)   Liberty Global Shares  , (b)   LiLAC Shares   and (c)   Old Liberty Global Shares   only includes the results of operations for the periods during which these shares were outstanding. Accordingly, (1) our     pro forma     net earnings (loss)     attributed to   Liberty Global Shares   and   LiLAC Shares   relates to the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the three months ended September 30, 2015 and (2) our pro forma net loss attributed to   Old Liberty Global Shares   relates to the six months ended June 30, 2015.

(  4  )      Derivative Instruments 
    
  In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against (i) increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt and (ii) foreign currency movements, particularly with respect to borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. In this regard, through our subsidiaries, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure with respect to the   U.S.   dollar (  $  ), the euro (     ), the British pound sterling (     ), the Swiss franc (  CHF  ), the Chilean peso (  CLP  ), the Czech koruna (  CZK  ), the Hungarian forint (  HUF  ), the Indian Rupee (  INR  ), the Jamaican dollar (  JMD  ), the Philippine Peso (  PHP  ), the Polish zloty (  PLN  ) and the Romanian lei (  RON  ). With the exception of a limited number of our foreign currency forward contracts, we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of most of our derivative instruments are recorded in realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For those derivative instruments that we account for using hedge accounting, the effective portions of the gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive loss and are subsequently reclassified into our statement of operations when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
    
  The following table provides details of the fair values of our derivative instrument assets and liabilities:

           (a) 
    Our long-term derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets, net, and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
       
           (b) 
    We consider credit risk in our fair value assessments. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , (i) the fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented assets have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating   $98.8 million   (excluding   $3.5 million   related to   Ziggo Group Holding  , which is accounted for as held for sale) and   $64.0 million  , respectively, and (ii) the fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented liabilities have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating   $144.1 million   (excluding   $74.5 million   related to   Ziggo Group Holding  , which is accounted for as held for sale) and   $86.5 million  , respectively. The adjustments to our derivative assets relate to the credit risk associated with counterparty nonperformance, and the adjustments to our derivative liabilities relate to credit risk associated with our own nonperformance. In all cases, the adjustments take into account offsetting liability or asset positions within a given contract. Our determination of credit risk valuation adjustments generally is based on our and our counterparties  credit risks, as observed in the credit default swap market and market quotations for certain of our subsidiaries  debt instruments, as applicable. The changes in the credit risk valuation adjustments associated with our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts resulted in a net gain (loss) of   $80.4 million   and (  $29.9 million  ) during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and net gains of   $87.5 million   and   $30.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are included in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For further information regarding our fair value measurements, see note   5  . 
       
           (c) 
    Our equity-related derivative instruments primarily include the fair value of (i) the share collar (the   ITV Collar  ) with respect to ITV plc (  ITV  ) shares held by our company, (ii) the share collar (the   Sumitomo Collar  ) with respect to the shares of Sumitomo Corporation (  Sumitomo  ) held by our company, (iii) the prepaid forward transaction (the   Lionsgate Forward  ) with respect to   2.5 million   of the shares of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (  Lionsgate  ) held by our company and (iv)   Virgin Media   s conversion hedges (the   Virgin Media Capped Calls  ) with respect to   Virgin Media   s   6.50%   convertible senior notes. The fair values of the   ITV Collar  , the   Sumitomo Collar   and the   Lionsgate Forward   do not include credit risk valuation

The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or financing activity in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument and the classification of the applicable underlying cash flows. For foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge capital expenditures, the net cash received or paid is classified as an adjustment to capital expenditures in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. For derivative contracts that are terminated prior to maturity, the cash paid or received upon termination that relates to future periods is classified as a financing activity. The classification of these net cash outflows is as follows: 

Counterparty Credit Risk 
    
  We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. With the exception of a limited number of instances where we have required a counterparty to post collateral, collateral has not been posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. At   September 30, 2016  , our exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of   $2,145.0 million  .  
    
  Details of our Derivative Instruments  
    
  In the following tables, we present the details of the various categories of our subsidiaries  derivative instruments. For each subsidiary with multiple derivative instruments that mature within the same calendar month, the notional amounts are shown in the aggregate, and interest rates are presented on a weighted average basis. In addition, for derivative instruments that were in effect as of   September 30, 2016  , we present a single date that represents the applicable final maturity date. For derivative instruments that become effective subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we present a range of dates that represents the period covered by the applicable derivative instruments.

Equity-related Derivatives 
    
  On May 22, 2016, the first tranches of the   Sumitomo Collar   and related borrowings (the   Sumitomo Collar Loan  ) became due and were settled using shares of   Sumitomo   that were borrowed pursuant to a securities lending arrangement (the   Sumitomo Share Loan  ). The aggregate market value of the borrowed   Sumitomo   shares on the transaction date was   $91.4 million  . For additional information, see note   7  . 

(  5  )      Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We use the fair value method to account for (i) certain of our investments, (ii) our derivative instruments, (iii) certain instruments that we classify as debt and (iv) the   Sumitomo Share Loan  . The reported fair values of these investments and instruments as of   September 30, 2016   likely will not represent the value that will be paid or received upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of these assets and liabilities. In the case of the investments that we account for using the fair value method, the values we realize upon disposition will be dependent upon, among other factors, market conditions and the forecasted financial performance of the investees at the time of any such disposition. With respect to our derivative and debt instruments, we expect that the values realized generally will be based on market conditions at the time of settlement, which may occur at the maturity of the derivative instrument or at the time of the repayment or refinancing of the underlying debt instrument.  
    
  U.S. GAAP   provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. We record transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during which the transfer occurred. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , no such transfers were made. 
    
  All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures, swap rates and certain of the inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These inputs, or interpolations or extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves, forward interest and currency rates and weighted average cost of capital rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market value assessments from the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal valuations and investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our internal valuations. 
    
  For our investments in   ITV  ,   Sumitomo   and   Lionsgate  , the recurring fair value measurements are based on the quoted closing price of the respective shares at each reporting date. Accordingly, the valuations of these investments fall under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our other investments that we account for at fair value are privately-held companies, and therefore, quoted market prices are unavailable. The valuation technique we use for such investments is a combination of an income approach (discounted cash flow model based on forecasts) and a market approach (market multiples of similar businesses). With the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used to value these investments are based on unobservable inputs derived from our assumptions. Therefore, the valuation of our privately-held investments falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Any reasonably foreseeable changes in assumed levels of unobservable inputs for the valuations of our Level 3 investments would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into the   Sumitomo Share Loan  . As the primary input for this recurring fair value measurement is the quoted market price of the borrowed shares of   Sumitomo  , we believe this valuation falls under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The recurring fair value measurement of our equity-related derivative instruments are based on binomial option pricing models, which require the input of observable and unobservable variables such as exchange-traded equity prices, risk-free interest rates, dividend yields and forecasted volatilities of the underlying equity securities. The valuations of our equity-related derivative instruments are based on a combination of Level 1 inputs (exchange-traded equity prices), Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures and swap rates) and Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities). As changes in volatilities could have a significant impact on the overall valuations, we have determined that these valuations fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At   September 30, 2016  , the

valuations of the   ITV Collar  , the   Sumitomo Collar  , the   Virgin Media Capped Calls   and the   Lionsgate Forward   were not significantly impacted by forecasted volatilities.  
    
  In order to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk, we have entered into (i) various derivative instruments and (ii) certain instruments that we classify as debt, as further described in note   4  . The recurring fair value measurements of these instruments are determined using discounted cash flow models. With the exception of the inputs for the   U.S.   dollar to Jamaican dollar cross-currency swaps (the   Sable Currency Swap  ) held by   Sable  , most of the inputs to these discounted cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable Level 2 data for substantially the full term of these instruments. This observable data includes most interest rate futures and swap rates, which are retrieved or derived from available market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we do not otherwise alter this data in performing our valuations. We incorporate a credit risk valuation adjustment in our fair value measurements to estimate the impact of both our own nonperformance risk and the nonperformance risk of our counterparties. Our and our counterparties  credit spreads represent our most significant Level 3 inputs, and these inputs are used to derive the credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to these instruments. As we would not expect changes in our or our counterparties  credit spreads to have a significant impact on the valuations of these instruments, we have determined that these valuations (other than the   Sable Currency Swap   valuation) fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Due to the lack of Level 2 inputs for the   Sable Currency Swap   valuation, we believe this valuation falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps are quantified and further explained in note   4  . 
    
  Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment assessments and acquisition accounting. These nonrecurring valuations include the valuation of reporting units, customer relationship intangible assets, property and equipment and the implied value of goodwill. The valuation of private reporting units is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses. With the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used in our discounted cash flow analyses, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our assumptions. The valuation of customer relationships is primarily based on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the customer relationship, considering such factors as estimated customer life, the revenue expected to be generated over the life of the customer relationship, contributory asset charges and other factors. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence. The implied value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, with the residual amount allocated to goodwill. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we performed nonrecurring valuations for the purpose of determining (i) the acquisition accounting for the   CWC Acquisition   and   BASE Acquisition   and (ii) the held-for-sale accounting for the   Dutch JV Entities  . The weighted average discount rates used to value the customer relationships acquired as a result of the   CWC Acquisition   ranged from   8.8%   to   12.8%  , and the weighted average cost of capital used to value the   Dutch JV Entities   was   7.5%  . None of the valuations for the   BASE Acquisition   had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information, see note   3  .

  Changes in the carrying amount of our goodwill during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are set forth below: 

_______________  
    
           (a) 
    Represents enterprise-level goodwill that is allocated to our Puerto Rico segment for purposes of our impairment tests.

  If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

Except as noted above, these transactions were completed as non-cash refinancings. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of   $16.0 million  . This loss includes (1) the write-off of unamortized discount of   $12.8 million   and (2) the write-off of   $3.2 million   of deferred financing costs.  
    
  In September 2016, (i)   Ziggo Secured Finance   issued (a)   $2,000.0 million   principal amount of   5.50%   senior secured notes (the   Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes  ) and (b)    775.0 million   (  $870.2 million  ) of   4.25%   senior secured notes (the   Ziggo 2027 Euro Senior Secured Notes   and, together with the   Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes  , the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Secured Notes  ), each due January 15, 2027, and (ii) Ziggo Bond Finance B.V. (  Ziggo Bond Finance  ), a special purpose finance entity owned   100%   by a third party, issued   $625.0 million   principal amount of   6.00%   senior notes due January 15, 2027 (the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes  ).   Ziggo Secured Finance   used   $300.0 million   of the net proceeds from the   Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes   (the   Funded Amount  ) to fund a senior secured proceeds loan (the   Ziggo Dollar Senior Secured Proceeds Loans  ) under a term loan facility agreement. The   Ziggo Dollar Senior Secured Proceeds Loans   were used to prepay   $300.0 million   of the principal amount outstanding under the   Ziggo Dollar Facility  .  
    
  Pending the formation of the   Dutch JV  , the remaining net proceeds from the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Secured Notes   and the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes   were placed into certain escrow accounts (the   Escrowed Proceeds  ). Upon consummation of the   Dutch JV  , the   Escrowed Proceeds   will be used, subject to certain conditions, to fund senior and senior secured proceeds loans under term loan facility agreements to one or more subsidiaries of   Ziggo Group Holding   or   Vodafone  , in each case, for the purpose of funding a loan, dividend, distribution or other payment to   Ziggo Group Holding   (which upon consummation of the   Dutch JV   will become the ultimate parent company of the   Dutch JV  ), and ultimately to   Liberty Global   and   Vodafone  , and paying related fees and expenses. If the   Dutch JV   is not consummated on or before September 23, 2017 (the   Longstop Date  ), the   Escrowed Proceeds   will be used to fund certain senior and senior secured proceeds loans under term loan facility agreements to one or more subsidiaries of   Ziggo Group Holding   for the purpose of refinancing indebtedness of   Ziggo Group Holding   or for general corporate purposes. If the   Dutch JV   is not consummated on or before the   Longstop Date   and all or a portion of the   Escrowed Proceeds   are released to one or more subsidiaries of   Ziggo Group Holding   for the purpose of refinancing indebtedness of   Ziggo Group Holding   or for general corporate purposes, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the   Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes   will be no less than   $500.0 million  , the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the   Ziggo 2027 Euro Senior Secured Notes   will be no less than    400.0 million   (  $449.1 million  ) (together with the minimum outstanding principal amount of the   Ziggo 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes  , the   Senior Secured Financing Amounts  ) and the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes   will be no less than   $500.0 million   (the   Senior Financing Amount  ). 
    
  Although   Ziggo Bond Finance  ,   Ziggo Secured Finance   and   Ziggo Secured Partnership   are each special purpose financing entities that are   100%   owned by a third party, the various financing transactions completed by   Ziggo Bond Finance  ,   Ziggo Secured Finance   and   Ziggo Secured Partnership   create variable interests for which   Ziggo Group Holding   and its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary. As such,   Ziggo Group Holding   and   Liberty Global   are required to consolidate   Ziggo Bond Finance  ,   Ziggo Secured Finance   and   Ziggo Secured Partnership  .  
    
  In the event that the   Dutch JV   is not or will not be consummated on or before the   Longstop Date  , or upon the occurrence of certain other events that would result in the termination of the escrow accounts (the   Escrow Termination Date  ),   Ziggo Secured Finance   and   Ziggo Bond Finance   will redeem all of the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Secured Notes   and the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes  , as applicable, other than (i) the   Funded Amount  , (ii) the   Senior Secured Financing Amounts   and (iii) the   Senior Financing Amount   at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Secured Notes   and the   Ziggo 2027 Senior Notes   redeemed, respectively, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of the redemption (the   Special Mandatory Redemption  ).

(  8  )      Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax benefit (expense) attributable to our earnings (loss)     before income taxes differs from the amounts computed using the applicable income tax rate as a result of the following factors:  

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The statutory or  expected  tax rate is the   U.K.   rate of   20.0%  . During 2015, the   U.K.   enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of   20.0%   to   19.0%   in April 2017 and   18.0%   in April 2020. Substantially all of the impact of these rate changes on our deferred tax balances was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the change in law was enacted. During the third quarter of 2016, the   U.K.   enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from   18.0%   to   17.0%  . The impact of this rate change on our deferred tax balances was recorded this quarter. 
       
           (b) 
    Country jurisdictions giving rise to increases within the   nine-month period   are grouped together and shown separately from country jurisdictions giving rise to decreases within the   nine-month period  . 
       
           (c) 
    Amounts reflect adjustments (either an increase or a decrease) to  expected  tax benefit (expense) for statutory rates in jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the   U.K.    
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , our unrecognized tax benefits of   $689.0 million   included   $372.4 million   of tax benefits that would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances and other factors.

We are currently undergoing income tax audits in Austria, Chile, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Panama, Poland, Slovakia, Trinidad and Tobago, the   U.S.   and certain other jurisdictions within the Caribbean and Latin America. Except as noted below, any adjustments that might arise from the foregoing examinations are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In the   U.S.  , we have received notices of adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to our 2010 and 2009 income tax returns, as well as a proposed adjustment to our 2013 withholding tax return. We have entered into the appeals process with respect to the 2013, 2010 and 2009 matters. In Chile, we recorded an income tax receivable in connection with the expected utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards upon the completion of a merger transaction of two indirect subsidiaries of Liberty Global. We are engaged in an ongoing examination by tax authorities in Chile in connection with this receivable and were notified during the third quarter of 2016 that approximately   48%   of our claim has been agreed by the tax authorities. We intend to pursue the payment of the remaining portion of this receivable through available methods. While we believe that the ultimate resolution of these proposed adjustments and resolution processes will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no assurance can be given that this will be the case given the amounts involved and the complex nature of the related issues. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of ongoing examinations by tax authorities as well as expiration of statutes of limitation could result in significant reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken as of   September 30, 2016  . The amount of any such reductions could range up to   $200 million  . Other than the potential impacts of these ongoing examinations and the expected expiration of certain statutes of limitation, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. No assurance can be given as to the nature or impact of any changes in our unrecognized tax positions during the next 12 months.

(  10  )      Share-based Compensation 
    
  Our share-based compensation expense primarily relates to the share-based incentive awards issued by   Liberty Global   to its employees and employees of its subsidiaries. A summary of the aggregate share-based compensation expense that is included in our operating and SG A expenses is set forth below:  

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i) performance-based restricted share units (  PSU  s  ), including amounts resulting from the   2016 PSUs  , as described and defined below, (ii) for the nine-month period, a challenge performance award plan for certain executive officers and key employees (the   Challenge Performance Awards  ) and (iii) the May 2014 grant of performance grant units (  PGUs  ) to our Chief Executive Officer. The   Challenge Performance Awards   include performance-based share appreciation rights (  PSAR  s  ) and   PSU  s. 
       
           (b) 
    In connection with the   LiLAC Transaction  , the compensation committee of our board of directors approved modifications to our outstanding share-based incentive awards (the   2015 Award Modifications  ) in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive plans. As a result of the   2015 Award Modifications  , the Black-Scholes fair values of our options, share appreciation rights (  SARs  ) and   PSAR  s increased, resulting in incremental share-based compensation expense of   $99.3 million  , of which   $63.5 million   was recognized during the third quarter of 2015 related to awards that vested on or prior to September 30, 2015.

All new awards are granted under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan or the Liberty Global 2014 Nonemployee Director Incentive Plan.

2016 PSUs 
    
  In February 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the grant of   PSU  s to executive officers and key employees (the   2016 PSUs  ) pursuant to a performance plan that is based on the achievement of a specified Adjusted OIBDA CAGR during the   three  -year period ended December 31, 2018. The   2016 PSUs   require delivery of a compound annual growth rate of our consolidated operating cash flow (  OCF CAGR  ) of   6.0%   during the   three  -year performance period ending December 31, 2018, with over- and under-performance payout opportunities should the   OCF CAGR   exceed or fail to meet the target, as applicable. A performance range of   75%   to   167.5%   of the target   OCF CAGR   will generally result in award recipients earning   75%   to   300%   of their target   2016 PSUs  , subject to reduction or forfeiture based on individual performance. The earned   2016 PSUs   will vest   50%   each on April 1, 2019 and October 1, 2019. 
    
  LiLAC Distribution    
    
  In connection with the   LiLAC Distribution  , the compensation committee of our board of directors approved modifications to our outstanding share-based incentive awards (the   2016 Award Modification  ) in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive plans. The objective of the compensation committee was to ensure a relatively unchanged intrinsic value of outstanding equity awards before and after the   LiLAC Distribution  . The mechanism to modify outstanding share-based incentive awards, as approved by the compensation committee, utilized the volume-weighted average price of the respective shares for the   five   days prior to and the   five   days following the bonus issuance. Based upon this approach, we determined the incremental value associated with the 2016 Award Modification was immaterial. As a result, we did not recognize any incremental share-based compensation expense associated with the   2016 Award Modification  . The tables set forth below present the impact resulting from this transaction.

(  11  )      Restructuring Liability 
    
  A summary of the changes in our restructuring liability during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is set forth in the table below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a)  
    Represents restructuring liabilities associated with the   Dutch JV Entities  . For information regarding the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities  , see note   3  .  
       
  Our restructuring charges during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   include employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization and integration activities of   $40.7 million   in Germany,   $20.7 million   in   U.K./Ireland  ,   $15.3 million   in the   European Operations Division   s central operations,   $10.6 million   in Chile and   $7.1 million   in the Netherlands. 
    
  We expect to continue to record significant restructuring charges over the next 12 months, due largely to our ongoing company-wide effort to optimize our operating model. In addition, we expect to undertake further restructuring programs in certain of our operating segments, including programs in connection with the integration of acquired entities.

Diluted   EPS   presents the dilutive effect, if any, on a per share basis of potential shares (e.g., options,   SAR  s,   PSAR  s,   RSU  s and convertible securities) as if they had been exercised, vested or converted at the beginning of the periods presented.

  We reported losses attributable to holders of   Liberty Global Shares   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Therefore, the potentially dilutive effect at   September 30, 2016   of the following items was not included in the computation of diluted loss per share attributable to holders of   Liberty Global Shares   because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the computation or, in the case of certain   PSU  s and   PGUs  , because such awards had not yet met the applicable performance criteria: (i) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options,   SAR  s,   PSAR  s and   RSU  s of approximately   51.2 million  , (ii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to   PSU  s and   PGUs   of approximately   9.3 million   and (iii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to obligations that may be settled in cash or shares of approximately   3.2 million  .

(  13  )      Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Commitments 
    
  In the normal course of business, we have entered into agreements that commit our company to make cash payments in future periods with respect to programming contracts, network and connectivity commitments, purchases of customer premises and other equipment and services, non-cancellable operating leases and other items. The following table sets forth the   U.S.   dollar equivalents of such commitments as of   September 30, 2016  . The commitments of   CWC   have been excluded from the table pending our verification of the amounts. These excluded commitments are not expected to be material in relation to our total commitments. 
  Due to the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities   at September 30, 2016, the amounts presented below do not include the contractual commitments of these entities. For information regarding the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities  , see note   3  .  

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our   September 30, 2016   condensed consolidated balance sheet.   
        
  Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming, studio output and sports rights contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. In addition, programming commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods. In this regard, our total programming and copyright costs aggregated   $1,851.5 million     (including   $1,609.7 million   for the   Liberty Global Group   and   $241.8 million   for the   LiLAC Group  ) and     $1,716.6 million   (including   $1,531.8 million   for the   Liberty Global Group   and   $184.8 million   for the   LiLAC Group  ) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Network and connectivity commitments include (i)   Telenet   s commitments for certain operating costs associated with its leased network, (ii) service commitments associated with our network extension projects, primarily in the   U.K.  , (iii) commitments associated with our mobile virtual network operator (  MVNO  ) agreements and (iv) certain repair and maintenance, fiber capacity and energy commitments of   Unitymedia  .   Telenet   s commitments for certain operating costs are subject to adjustment based on changes in the network operating costs incurred by   Telenet   with respect to its own networks. These potential adjustments are not subject to reasonable estimation and, therefore, are not included in the above table. The amounts reflected in the above table with respect to certain of our   MVNO   commitments represent fixed minimum amounts payable under these agreements and, therefore, may be significantly less than the actual amounts we ultimately pay in these periods.

Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) the purchase of customer premises and other equipment and (ii) certain service-related commitments, including call center, information technology and maintenance services. 
    
  Commitments arising from acquisition agreements are not reflected in the above table. For information regarding our commitments under acquisition agreements, see note   3  .  
    
  In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , see note   4  . 
    
  We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities and municipalities, which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts or to upgrade, rebuild or extend portions of our broadband communication systems. Such amounts are not included in the above table because they are not fixed or determinable.  
    
  Guarantees and Other Credit Enhancements 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we may provide (i) indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain other parties and (ii) performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors. Historically, these arrangements have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments in the future. 
    
  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies  
    
  Interkabel Acquisition.   On   November 26, 2007  ,   Telenet   and   four   associations of municipalities in Belgium, which we refer to as the pure intercommunales or the    PICs  ,  announced a non-binding agreement-in-principle to transfer the analog and digital television activities of the   PICs  , including all existing subscribers to   Telenet  . Subsequently,   Telenet   and the   PICs   entered into a binding agreement (the   2008 PICs Agreement  ), which closed effective   October 1, 2008  . Beginning in December   2007  , Proximus NV/SA (  Proximus  ), the incumbent telecommunications operator in Belgium, instituted several proceedings seeking to block implementation of these agreements.   Proximus   lodged summary proceedings with the President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp to obtain a provisional injunction preventing the   PICs   from effecting the agreement-in-principle and initiated a civil procedure on the merits claiming the annulment of the agreement-in-principle. In March   2008  , the President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of   Proximus   in the summary proceedings, which ruling was overturned by the Court of Appeal of Antwerp in June   2008  .   Proximus   brought this appeal judgment before the Cour de Cassation (the   Belgian Supreme Court  ), which confirmed the appeal judgment in September 2010. On   April 6, 2009  , the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of the   PICs   and   Telenet   in the civil procedure on the merits, dismissing   Proximus   s request for the rescission of the agreement-in-principle and the   2008 PICs Agreement  . On   June 12, 2009  ,   Proximus   appealed this judgment with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. In this appeal,   Proximus   is now also seeking compensation for damages should the   2008 PICs Agreement   not be rescinded. While these proceedings were suspended indefinitely, other proceedings were initiated, which resulted in a ruling by the Belgian Council of State in May 2014 annulling (i) the decision of the   PICs   not to organize a public market consultation and (ii) the decision from the   PICs    board of directors to approve the   2008 PICs Agreement  . In December 2015,   Proximus   resumed the civil proceedings pending with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp seeking to have the   2008 PICs Agreement   annulled and claiming damages of    1.4 billion   (  $1.6 billion  ).  
    
  Telenet   intends to defend itself vigorously in the resumed proceedings and does not expect an outcome before the end of 2017. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these or other proceedings. However, an unfavorable outcome of existing or future proceedings could potentially lead to the annulment of the   2008 PICs Agreement   and/or to an obligation of   Telenet   to pay compensation for damages, subject to the relevant provisions of the   2008 PICs Agreement  , which stipulate that   Telenet   is responsible for damages in excess of    20.0 million   (  $22.5 million  ). We do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   No   amounts have been accrued by us with respect to this matter as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable.

Deutsche Telekom   Litigation.   On December 28, 2012,   Unitymedia   filed a lawsuit against Telekom Deutschland GmbH (  Deutsche Telekom  ), an operating subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG, in which   Unitymedia   asserts that it pays excessive prices for the co-use of   Deutsche Telekom   s cable ducts in   Unitymedia   s footprint. The Federal Network Agency approved rates for the co-use of certain ducts of   Deutsche Telekom   in March 2011. Based in part on these approved rates,   Unitymedia   is seeking a reduction of the annual lease fees (approximately    76 million   (  $85 million  ) for 2012) by approximately   two-thirds   and the return of similarly calculated overpayments from 2009 through the ultimate settlement date, plus accrued interest. In October 2016, the first instance court dismissed this action. Unitymedia is evaluating whether to appeal this decision, and no assurance can be given that   Unitymedia   s claims will be successful. Any recovery by   Unitymedia   will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition of this matter has been reached.  
    
  Vivendi   Litigation.   A wholly-owned subsidiary of our company was a plaintiff in certain litigation titled Liberty Media Corporation, et. al. v. Vivendi S.A. and Universal Studios. A predecessor of   Liberty Global   was a subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation (  Liberty Media  ) through June 6, 2004. In connection with   Liberty Media   s prosecution of the action, our subsidiary assigned its rights to   Liberty Media   in exchange for a contingent payout in the event   Liberty Media   recovered any amounts as a result of the action. In February 2016,   Vivendi   S.A. (  Vivendi  ) and   Liberty Media   settled the litigation and, as a result of such settlement, our subsidiary received a cash payment of   $69.8 million  , which is included in other income (expense), net, in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and other investing activities, net, in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.     We consider this matter to be closed. 
    
  Liberty Puerto Rico   Matter.   In November 2012, we completed a business combination that resulted in, among other matters, the combination of our then operating subsidiary in Puerto Rico with San Juan Cable, LLC dba OneLink Communications (  OneLink  ). In connection with this transaction (the   OneLink Acquisition  ),   Liberty Puerto Rico  , as the surviving entity, became a party to certain claims previously asserted by the incumbent telephone operator (  PRTC  ) against   OneLink   based on alleged conduct of   OneLink   that occurred prior to the   OneLink Acquisition   (the   PRTC Claim  ). The   PRTC Claim   includes an allegation that   OneLink   acted in an anticompetitive manner in connection with a series of legal and regulatory proceedings it initiated against   PRTC   in Puerto Rico beginning in 2009. In March 2014, a separate class action claim was filed in Puerto Rico (the   Class Action Claim  ) containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted in the   PRTC Claim  , but alleging ongoing injury on behalf of a consumer class (as opposed to harm to a competitor). In July 2016, the judge presiding over the   PRTC Claim   in the United States District Court for the District of Maine (the   District Court  ) granted   OneLink   summary judgment that dismissed the   PRTC Claim   in its entirety. In August 2016,   PRTC   filed a notice with the United States First Circuit Court of Appeals indicating it will appeal the   District Court   s decision. Based on   Liberty Puerto Rico   s assessment of the   PRTC Claim   on appeal and the   Class Action Claim  , we have determined that the possibility of loss is remote. Accordingly,   Liberty Puerto Rico   has reversed its previously-recorded provision and related indemnification asset associated with the   PRTC Claim  , resulting in a   $5.1 million   reduction to our SG A expenses during the third quarter of 2016. Pursuant to indemnification arrangements entered into with the former owners of   OneLink  , we may recover a portion of the legal fees we incurred in connection with the   PRTC Claim  . 
    
  Belgium Regulatory Developments.   In December 2010, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicatie and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the   Belgium Regulatory Authorities  ) published their respective draft decisions reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium. 
    
  The   Belgium Regulatory Authorities   adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the   July 2011 Decision  ) with some minor revisions. The regulatory obligations imposed by the   July 2011 Decision   include (i) an obligation to make a resale offer at  retail minus   of the cable analog package available to third-party operators (including   Proximus  ), (ii) an obligation to grant third-party operators (except   Proximus  ) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at  retail minus  and (iii) an obligation to make a resale offer at  retail minus   of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital television access obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except   Proximus  ).  
    
  In February 2012,   Telenet   submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above, and the   Belgium Regulatory Authorities   published the final decision on September 9, 2013.   Telenet   has implemented the access obligations as described in its reference offers and, on March 1, 2016, Orange Belgium NV (  Orange Belgium  ), formerly known as Mobistar SA, launched a commercial offer combining a cable TV package and broadband internet access for certain of their mobile customers. In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014,   Proximus   submitted a request to   Telenet   to commence access negotiations.   Telenet   contests this request and has asked the   Belgium

Regulatory Authorities   to assess the reasonableness of the   Proximus   request. The timing for a decision regarding this assessment by the   Belgium Regulatory Authorities   is not known, but is expected before the end of 2016.  
    
  On December 14, 2015, the   Belgium Regulatory Authorities   published a draft decision, which amended previously-issued decisions and sets forth the  retail minus  tariffs of minus   26%   for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and minus   18%   for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services during an initial   two  -year period. Following this   two  -year period, the tariffs would change to minus   15%   and   7%  , respectively. The draft decision was notified to the   European Commission   and a final decision was adopted on February 19, 2016. A  retail minus  method of pricing involves a wholesale tariff calculated as the retail price for the offered service by   Telenet  , excluding   VAT   and copyrights, and further deducting the retail costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing and sales). 
    
  Telenet   filed an appeal against the   July 2011 Decision   with the Brussels Court of Appeal. On November 12, 2014, the Brussels Court of Appeal rejected   Telenet   s appeal of the   July 2011 Decision   and accepted   Proximus   s claim that   Proximus   should be allowed access to   Telenet   s, among other operators, digital television platform and the resale of bundles of digital video and broadband internet services. On November 30, 2015,   Telenet   filed an appeal of this decision with the   Belgian Supreme Court  . In 2014,   Telenet   and wireless operator   Orange Belgium   each filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the initial retail minus decisions. These appeals are still pending. On April 25, 2016,   Telenet   also filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal challenging the February 19, 2016 retail minus decision. There can be no certainty that   Telenet   s appeals will be successful.  
    
  The   July 2011 Decision   aims to, and in its application may, strengthen   Telenet   s competitors by granting them resale access to   Telenet   s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding   Telenet   s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (i) limit the bandwidth available to   Telenet   to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (ii) adversely impact   Telenet   s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to   Telenet   s network and other competitive factors or market developments.  
    
  Financial Transactions Tax.   Certain countries in the European Union (  E.U.  ), including Germany, Austria and Slovakia, are participating in an enhanced cooperation procedure to introduce a financial transactions tax (the   FTT  ). Under the draft language of the   FTT   proposal, a wide range of financial transactions could be taxed at rates of at least   0.01%   for derivative transactions based on the notional amount and   0.1%   for other covered financial transactions based on the underlying transaction price. Each of the individual countries would be permitted to determine an exact rate, which could be higher than the proposed rates of   0.01%   and   0.1%  . Any implementation of the   FTT   could have a global impact because it would apply to all financial transactions where a financial institution is involved (including unregulated entities that engage in certain types of covered activity) and either of the parties (whether the financial institution or its counterparty) is in one of the participating countries. Although there continues to be ongoing discussions in the relevant countries around the   FTT  , uncertainty remains as to if and when the   FTT   will be implemented and the breadth of its application. Based on our understanding of the current status of the potential   FTT  , we do not expect that any implementation of the   FTT   would occur before 2018. Any imposition of the   FTT   could increase banking fees and introduce taxes on internal transactions that we currently perform. Due to the uncertainty regarding the   FTT  , we are currently unable to estimate the financial impact that the   FTT   could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  
    
  Virgin Media VAT   Matters.   Virgin Media   s application of   VAT   with respect to certain revenue generating activities has been challenged by the   U.K.   tax authorities.   Virgin Media   has estimated its maximum exposure in the event of an unfavorable outcome to be    46.4 million   (  $60.2 million  ) as of   September 30, 2016  .   No   portion of this exposure has been accrued by   Virgin Media   as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. A court hearing was held at the end of September 2014 in relation to the   U.K.   tax authorities  challenge and the timing of the court s decision is uncertain. 
    
  On March 19, 2014, the   U.K.   government announced a change in legislation with respect to the charging of   VAT   in connection with prompt payment discounts such as those that we offer to our fixed-line telephony customers. This change, which took effect on May 1, 2014, impacted our company and some of our competitors. The   U.K.   tax authority issued a decision in the fourth quarter of 2015 challenging our application of the prompt payment discount rules prior to the May 1, 2014 change in legislation. We have appealed this decision. As part of the appeal process, we were required to make aggregate payments of    67.0 million     (  $99.1 million   at the respective transaction dates), which included the challenged amount of    63.7 million   and related interest of    3.3 million  . The aggregate amount paid does not include penalties, which could be significant in the unlikely event that penalties were to be assessed. This matter will likely be subject to court proceedings that could delay the ultimate resolution for an extended period of

time.   No   portion of this potential exposure has been accrued by our company as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. 
    
  Hungary VAT Matter.   In February 2016, our direct-to-home satellite (  DTH  ) operations in Luxembourg received a second instance decision from the Hungarian tax authorities as a result of an audit with respect to   VAT   payments that the Hungarian tax authorities conducted for the years 2010 through 2012. The Hungarian tax authorities assessed our   DTH   operations with an obligation to pay   VAT   for the years audited of HUF   5,413.2 million   (  $19.7 million  ), excluding interest and penalties, which could be significant. We believe that our   DTH   operations have operated in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and interpretations thereof, including a binding tax ruling that we received from the Hungarian government in 2010. In October 2016 a Budapest court disagreed with the tax authorities and dismissed the assessment. We expect the final written opinion by the judge in late November, which decision is subject to appeal to the Hungarian Supreme Court.   No   portion of this exposure has been accrued by us as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. 
    
  Telenet MVNO Matter.   Telenet   and   Orange Belgium   were in dispute over amounts payable to   Orange Belgium   with respect to certain provisions of their   MVNO   agreement, and   Orange Belgium   initiated legal proceedings against   Telenet   claiming, among other things, that the migration period after termination or expiration of the   MVNO   agreement should be shortened from   24 months   to   six months  . In May 2016, the parties reached an agreement settling all outstanding legal disputes between both companies and defining the terms and conditions of the   MVNO   arrangement including the future termination date of the   MVNO   agreement. We consider this matter closed. 
    
  Other Regulatory Issues.   Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the   E.U.   Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.  
    
  We have been notified of a fourfold increase in the rateable value of our network and other assets in the   U.K.   that is scheduled to become effective on April 1, 2017. This increase will affect the amount we pay for network infrastructure charges as the annual amount payable to the   U.K.   government is calculated by applying a percentage multiplier to the rateable value of assets. The multiplier applicable for 2017 and future years has not yet been confirmed. The phasing of the increase in rates will also be affected by transitional relief, the mechanism for which remains under consultation. If implemented, this proposed change, together with a similar proposed change in Ireland, would result in significant increases in our network infrastructure charges. Depending on the final determinations with respect to the multiplier and transitional relief, we estimate that the aggregate amount of these increases will range between    25 million   (  $32 million  ) and    35 million   (  $45 million  ) during 2017 and will build to a maximum aggregate increase of up to    150 million   (  $195 million  ) in 2021. We believe that the proposed increases are excessive, and we will challenge the underlying methodology and assumptions.  
    
  We have security accreditations across a range of   B2B   products and services in order to increase our offerings to public sector organizations in the   U.K.   These accreditations are granted subject to periodic reviews of our policies and procedures by   U.K.   governmental authorities. If we were to fail to maintain these accreditations or obtain new accreditations when required, it could impact our ability to provide certain offerings to the public sector. 
    
  In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving   VAT   and wage, property, withholding and other tax issues and (iii) disputes over interconnection, programming, copyright and channel carriage fees. While we generally expect that the amounts required to satisfy these contingencies will not materially differ from any estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that the resolution of one or more of these contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack of a clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows that might result from any unfavorable outcomes.

(  14  )      Segment Reporting 
    
  We generally identify our reportable segments as those consolidated subsidiaries that represent   10%   or more of our revenue,   Adjusted OIBDA   (as defined below) or total assets. In certain cases, we may elect to include an operating segment in our segment disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and   Adjusted OIBDA  . In addition, we review non-financial measures such as subscriber growth, as appropriate. 
    
  Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (  Adjusted OIBDA  ) is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance.   Adjusted OIBDA   is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term,   Adjusted OIBDA   is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe   Adjusted OIBDA   is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. A reconciliation of total segment   Adjusted OIBDA   to our earnings (loss) before income taxes is presented below. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our reportable segments are as follows: 

European Operations Division  : 
                
    U.K./Ireland    
                
    The Netherlands 
                
    Germany 
                
    Belgium 
                
    Switzerland/Austria    
                
    Central and Eastern Europe    

LiLAC Division:    
                
    CWC    
                
    Chile 
                
    Puerto Rico 
       
  All of the reportable segments set forth above derive their revenue primarily from consumer and   B2B   services, including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and, with the exception of Puerto Rico, mobile services. At   September 30, 2016  , our operating segments in the   European Operations Division   provided consumer and   B2B   services in   12   European countries and   DTH   services to customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through a Luxembourg-based organization that we refer to as    UPC DTH  .  In addition to   UPC DTH  , our Central and Eastern Europe segment includes our broadband communications operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. The   European Operations Division   s central and other category includes (i) costs associated with certain centralized functions, including billing systems, network operations, technology, marketing, facilities, finance and other administrative functions, and (ii) intersegment eliminations within the   European Operations Division  . In addition, our   LiLAC Division   provides consumer and   B2B   services in (a)   18   countries, all but   one   of which are located in Latin America and the Caribbean, through   CWC  , (b) Chile through   VTR   and (c) Puerto Rico through   Liberty Puerto Rico  .   CWC   also provides (1)   B2B   services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (2) wholesale services over its sub-sea and terrestrial networks that connect over   30   markets in that region. The corporate and other category for the   Liberty Global Group   includes less significant consolidated operating segments that provide programming and other services. Intersegment eliminations primarily represent the elimination of intercompany transactions between our broadband communications and programming operations.

Revenue by Major Category 
    
  Our revenue by major category is set forth below:    

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period. 

(c) 
    B2B   revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain small or home office (  SOHO  ) subscribers.   SOHO   subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. Revenue from   SOHO   subscribers, which is included in subscription revenue, aggregated   $132.7 million   and   $78.7 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $356.7 million   and   $213.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
           (d) 
    Other revenue includes, among other items,   mobile handset sales, interconnect, channel carriage fee and installation revenue  .

(  15  )      Subsequent Events 
    
  Telenet   Refinancing Transaction 
    
  In November 2016, (i)   Telenet International  , a wholly-owned subsidiary of   Telenet  , entered into a new    1,600.0 million   (  $1,796.5 million  ) term loan facility (  Telenet Facility AE  ), which matures on January 31, 2025, bears interest at a rate of   3.25%   and is subject to a LIBOR floor of   0.0%  , and (ii)   Telenet Finance   entered into a new   $1,500.0 million   term loan facility (  Telenet Facility AF  ), which matures on January 31, 2025, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   3.0%   and is subject to a LIBOR floor of   0.0%  . The net proceeds from   Telenet Facility AE     and     Telenet Facility AF   will be used to prepay in full (a) the    474.1 million   (  $532.3 million  ) outstanding principal amount under   Telenet Facility W  ,     (b) the    882.9 million   (  $991.4 million  ) outstanding principal amount under   Telenet Facility Y  , (c) the    800.0 million   (  $898.3 million  ) outstanding principal amount under   Telenet Facility AA   and (d) the   $850.0 million   outstanding principal amount under   Telenet Facility AD  .  
  Pending Acquisition  
    
  On October 18, 2016, our subsidiary UPC Polska SP Z.o.o. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the cable business of Multimedia Polska S.A. (  Multimedia  ), the third-largest cable operator in Poland, for cash consideration of PLN   3.0 billion   (  $783.6 million  ), which is equal to the enterprise value assigned to   Multimedia   for purposes of this transaction. The final purchase price is subject to potential downward adjustments for the operational and financial performance of   Multimedia   prior to closing. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to close within the next 12 months.

  Forward-looking Statements 
    
  Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. To the extent that statements in this Quarterly Report are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements, which, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In particular, statements under   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   and   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   may     contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our business, product, foreign currency and finance strategies, our property and equipment additions (including with respect to network extensions), subscriber growth and retention rates, competitive, regulatory and economic factors, the timing and impacts of proposed transactions, the maturity of our markets, the anticipated impacts of new legislation (or changes to existing rules and regulations), anticipated changes in our revenue, costs or growth rates, our liquidity, credit risks, foreign currency risks, target leverage levels, our future projected contractual commitments and cash flows and other information and statements that are not historical fact. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. In addition to the risk factors described in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our June 30, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following are some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from anticipated results or events:

    77 

events that are outside of our control, such as political unrest in international markets, terrorist attacks, malicious human acts, natural disasters, pandemics and other similar events. 
     The broadband distribution and mobile service industries are changing rapidly and, therefore, the forward-looking statements of expectations, plans and intent in this Quarterly Report are subject to a significant degree of risk. These forward-looking statements and the above-described risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. 

Overview 
    
  We are an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and other communications services to consumers and businesses, with consolidated operations at   September 30, 2016   in more than   30   countries. We provide consumer and   B2B   services in (i) the   U.K.   and Ireland through   Virgin Media  , (ii) the Netherlands through   Ziggo Group Holding  , (iii) Germany through   Unitymedia  , (iv) Belgium through   Telenet   and (v)   seven   other European countries through   UPC Holding  . The operations of   Virgin Media  ,   Ziggo Group Holding  ,   Unitymedia  ,   Telenet   and   UPC Holding   are collectively referred to herein as the    European Operations Division  .  In addition, we provide consumer and   B2B   services in (a)   18   countries, predominantly in Latin America or the Caribbean, through   CWC  , (b) Chile through   VTR   and (c) Puerto Rico through   Liberty Puerto Rico  .   CWC   also provides (1)   B2B   services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (2) wholesale services over its sub-sea and terrestrial networks that connect over 30 markets in that region. The operations of   CWC  ,   VTR   and   Liberty Puerto Rico   are collectively referred to herein as the    LiLAC Division  .  
    
  On July 1, 2015, we completed the   LiLAC Transaction  , pursuant to which we (i) reclassified our then outstanding   Old Liberty Global Shares   into   Liberty Global Shares   and (ii) distributed   LiLAC Shares   to holders of our   Old Liberty Global Shares  . The   Liberty Global Shares   and the   LiLAC Shares   are intended to reflect or  track  the economic performance of the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group  , respectively. For additional information, see note   1   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We have completed a number of transactions that impact the comparability of our   2016   and   2015   results of operations, including the   CWC Acquisition   on May 16, 2016, the     BASE Acquisition   on February 11, 2016 and the     Choice Acquisition   on June 3, 2015. For further information regarding our acquisitions and the pending formation of the   Dutch JV  , see note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we are the largest international broadband communications operator in terms of customers. At   September 30, 2016  , we owned and operated networks that passed   56,246,700     homes and served   59,576,100   revenue generating units (  RGU  s), consisting of   24,210,700   video subscribers,   19,319,800   broadband internet subscribers and   16,045,600   fixed-line telephony subscribers. In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , we served   10,421,400   mobile subscribers.  
    
  Including the effect of acquisitions, we added a total of   293,700   and 2,617,200   RGU  s during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Excluding the effect of acquisitions (  RGU  s added on the acquisition date), but including post-acquisition date changes in   RGU  s, we added   283,700   and 716  ,  600   RGU  s on an organic basis during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to 321,300 and 532,700   RGU  s added on an organic basis during the corresponding prior-year periods. The organic   RGU   growth during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily attributable to the     net effect of (i) increases of   207,500   and 576,700 broadband internet   RGU  s, respectively, (ii) decreases of   104,400   and 382,000 basic video   RGU  s, respectively, (iii) increases of   110,100   and 374,600 fixed-line telephony   RGU  s, respectively, and (iv) increases of   63,200   and 142,300 enhanced video   RGU  s, respectively.  
    
  Including the effect of acquisitions, we added 44,700 and 5,837,900 mobile subscribers during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.   Excluding the effect of acquisitions, we added   44,700     and     138,800     mobile subscribers on an organic basis during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to 69,800 and 216,200 added on an organic basis during the corresponding prior-year periods. The organic growth during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     includes (i) increases     in postpaid mobile subscribers of   140,200   and 359,100, respectively, and (ii) decreases in prepaid mobile subscribers of   95,500   and 220,300, respectively.

We are experiencing significant competition from incumbent telecommunications operators (particularly in the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland, where the incumbent telecommunications operators are overbuilding our networks with fiber-to-the-home, -cabinet, -building or -node and advanced digital subscriber line technologies),   DTH   operators and/or other providers in all of our markets. In the Bahamas, where   CWC   has been the only provider of mobile services, competition will increase significantly once commercial mobile services are launched by a competitor, which is expected to occur before the end of 2016. In addition, in certain of   CWC  's markets,   CWC   is experiencing increased regulatory intervention that would, if implemented, facilitate increased competition. In certain of our markets, this significant competition, together with the maturation of these markets, has contributed to organic declines in revenue,   RGU  s and/or average monthly subscription revenue per average cable   RGU   or mobile subscriber, as applicable (  ARPU  ), the more notable of which include:  
    
           (i) 
    organic declines in (a) cable subscription in the Netherlands and Switzerland and (b) overall revenue in the Netherlands during the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  ;  
       
           (ii) 
    organic declines during the   third   quarter of   2016   in (a) video   RGU  s in the majority of our markets, (b) fixed-line telephony   RGU  s in Chile, the Netherlands and Switzerland and (c) total   RGU  s in Switzerland and the Netherlands; and 
       
           (iii) 
    organic declines in overall cable   ARPU   in many of our markets during the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
       
  In addition, due to competitive and macroeconomic factors,   CWC   has experienced organic revenue declines in many of its markets, including Barbados, the Bahamas, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. We acquired   CWC   on May 16, 2016. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the   U.K.   held a referendum in which   U.K.   citizens voted in favor of, on an advisory basis, an exit from the   E.U.   commonly referred to as    Brexit  .  Although the vote is non-binding, the British government has announced it will formally notify the   E.U.   in March 2017 of its intention to leave the   E.U.   The   U.K.   High Court ruled on November 3, 2016 that the   U.K.   parliament must vote on whether the   U.K.   can start the process of leaving the   E.U.   The British government has appealed the ruling, which may take several months. The outcome of the appeal is relevant for the timing and terms under which the parties will commence negotiations to determine the terms of the   U.K.   s withdrawal from the   E.U.   A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the   U.K.   and the   E.U.  , undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the   U.K.   and the   E.U.   or other nations (including the   U.S.  ) as the   U.K.   pursues independent trade relations. The initial impact of the announcement of   Brexit   caused significant volatility in global stock markets, including in the prices of our shares. In addition, the   U.S.   dollar has significantly strengthened against the British pound sterling during the period following Brexit. The effects of   Brexit   could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  We are facing a challenging economic environment in Puerto Rico due in part to the government s liquidity issues. In this regard, the Puerto Rico government has failed to make significant portions of its scheduled debt payments during 2016. Although the Puerto Rico government has implemented tax increases and other measures to improve its solvency and the   U.S.   has implemented legislation designed to help manage Puerto Rico s debt crisis, it remains possible, if not likely, that Puerto Rico will be required to restructure its debt obligations. If the fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico were to worsen, the population of Puerto Rico could continue to decline and the demand and ability of customers to pay for   Liberty Puerto Rico   s services could be impaired, both of which could have a negative impact on   Liberty Puerto Rico   s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  In early October 2016, our fixed-line and mobile networks in the Bahamas suffered extensive damage as a result of Hurricane Matthew.  Although many of our customers experienced significant outages as a result of Hurricane Matthew, service to most     of our fixed-line and mobile subscribers has now been restored. As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Mathew, we expect that our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA in the Bahamas will be adversely impacted for a number of months     and that we will be required to make significant property and equipment additions in order to fully repair the damage to our fixed-line and mobile networks.  Although we are continuing to gather information regarding the condition of our networks and the time frames that customers will not be connected to our networks, our preliminary estimate is that the adverse impact of Hurricane Matthew on our revenue and Adjusted OIBDA in the Bahamas during the fourth quarter of 2016 will range from $8 million to $10 million and $8 million to $12 million, respectively. In addition, we expect that the total property and equipment additions required to repair our networks in the Bahamas will ultimately range from $35 million to $45 million, with $9 million to $12 million of these additions expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2017, we expect the adverse impacts on our revenue and  
  
    79 

Adjusted OIBDA from Hurricane Matthew to progressively decline.  Although we have property and business interruption insurance that we expect will cover a significant portion of our Hurricane Matthew losses, no assurance can be given as to the amount and timing of the insurance proceeds that we will ultimately recover.  

Material Changes in Results of Operations 
    
  As noted under   Overview   above, the comparability of our operating results during   2016   and   2015   is affected by acquisitions. In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of acquisitions on our operating results. The acquisition impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results of the periods under comparison that is attributable to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the acquisition impact on an acquired entity s operating results during the first three to six months following the acquisition date, as adjusted to remove integration costs and any other material nonrecurring or nonoperational items, such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are considered to be organic changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, (i) variances attributed to an acquired entity during the first 12 months following the acquisition date represent differences between the estimated acquisition impact and the actual results and (ii) the calculation of our organic growth percentages includes the organic growth of an acquired entity relative to our estimate of the acquisition impact of such entity.  
    
  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as all of our operating subsidiaries, except for Puerto Rico,   CWC   and certain of   CWC   s subsidiaries, have functional currencies other than the   U.S.   dollar. Our primary exposure to foreign currency translation effects (  FX  ) risk during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was to the euro and British pound sterling as     43.3% and 28.3% of our   U.S.   dollar revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and British pound sterling, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Swiss franc and other local currencies in Europe, as well as the Chilean peso. The portions of the changes     in the various components of our results of operations that are attributable to changes in   FX   are highlighted under   Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments   and   Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results   below. For information concerning applicable foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the periods covered by this Quarterly Report, see   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Foreign Currency Exchange Rates   below. 
    
  The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100% of each operating segment s revenue and   Adjusted OIBDA  . As we have the ability to control   Telenet  ,   Liberty Puerto Rico   and certain subsidiaries of   CWC   that are not wholly owned, we consolidate 100% of the revenue and expenses of these entities in our condensed consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that third parties own significant interests in these entities. The noncontrolling owners  interests in the operating results of   Telenet  ,   Liberty Puerto Rico  , certain subsidiaries of   CWC   and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For additional information, see note   1   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments 

General 
    
  All of the reportable segments set forth below derive their revenue primarily from (i) broadband communications services, including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services, (ii)   B2B   services and (iii) with the exception of Puerto Rico, mobile services. For detailed information regarding the composition of our reportable segments, see note   14   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The tables presented below in this section provide a separate analysis of each of the line items that comprise   Adjusted OIBDA  , as further discussed in note   14   to our condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as an analysis of   Adjusted OIBDA   by reportable segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These tables present (i) the amounts reported by each of our reportable segments for the current and comparative periods, (ii) the   U.S.   dollar change and percentage change from period to period and (iii) the organic percentage change from period to period (percentage change after removing   FX   and the estimated impacts of acquisitions and dispositions). The comparisons that exclude   FX   assume that exchange rates remained constant at the prior-year rate during the comparative periods that are included in each table. We also provide a table showing the   Adjusted OIBDA   margins of our reportable segments for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   at the end of this section. 

80 

The revenue of our reportable segments includes revenue earned from (i) subscribers to our broadband communication and other fixed-line and   DTH   services (collectively referred to herein as    cable subscription revenue   ) and our mobile services and (ii)   B2B   services, interconnect fees, mobile handset sales, channel carriage fees, installation fees, late fees and advertising revenue. Consistent with the presentation of our revenue categories in note   14   to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the term  subscription revenue  in the following discussion to refer to amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late fees. In the following tables, mobile subscription revenue excludes the related interconnect revenue. 
    
  In the   U.K.  , Belgium and   Switzerland/Austria  , we now offer our customers the option to purchase a mobile handset pursuant to a contract that is independent of a mobile airtime services contract (a   Split-contract Program  ). Revenue associated with handsets sold under a   Split-contract Program   is recognized upfront and included in other non-subscription revenue. We generally recognize the full sales price for the mobile handset upon delivery, regardless of whether the sales price is received upfront or in installments. Prior to the   Split-contract Program  s, all revenue from handset sales that was contingent upon delivering future airtime services was recognized over the life of the customer contract as part of the monthly fee and included in subscription revenue. 
    
  Most of our revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer   VAT   or similar revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience increases in our operating expenses and corresponding declines in our   Adjusted OIBDA   and   Adjusted OIBDA   margins to the extent of any such tax increases. 
    
  We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers terminate on another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from their customers terminate on our networks or networks that we access through   MVNO   or other arrangements. The amounts we charge and incur with respect to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are subject to regulatory oversight in many of our markets. To the extent that regulatory authorities introduce fixed-line or mobile termination rate changes, we would experience prospective changes and, in very limited cases, we could experience retroactive changes in our interconnect revenue and/or costs. The ultimate impact of any such changes in termination rates on our   Adjusted OIBDA   would be dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are subject to the changed termination rates.

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods include the post-acquisition revenue of   BASE  , which was acquired on February 11, 2016. 
       
           (b) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods reflect the post-acquisition revenue of   CWC  , which was acquired on May 16, 2016. 
       
           (c) 
    The amount presented for the 2015 nine-month period excludes the pre-acquisition revenue of   Choice  , which was acquired on   June 3, 2015  . 
       
  N.M.   Not Meaningful. 
    
  General.   While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our reportable segments, we are experiencing significant competition in all of our markets. This competition has an adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our   RGU  s and/or   ARPU  . For a description of the more notable recent impacts of this competition on our broadband communications markets, see   Overview   above.  
    
  Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of   RGU  s or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in   ARPU  . Changes in   ARPU   can be attributable to (a) price increases, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of cable and mobile products within a segment during the period. In the  
  
    83 

following discussion, we discuss   ARPU   changes in terms of the net impact of the above factors on the   ARPU   that is derived from our video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile products. 
    
  U.K./Ireland  .   The   decreases     in   U.K./Ireland   s revenue during   the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $54.5 million   or   3.0%   and   $175.2 million   or   3.3%  , respectively, (ii) the impact of an acquisition, (iii) the impact of disposals and (iv) the impact of   FX  , as set f  orth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related   to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) increases in the average numbers of broadband internet and fixed-line telephony   RGU  s in the   U.K.   and (ii) declines in the average number of enhanced video   RGU  s and, to a much lesser extent, the average numbers of basic     video   RGU  s in   Ireland. In addition, the increases in each period include a slight decrease for the three-month comparison and a slight increase for the nine-month comparison in the average number of fixed-line telephony   RGU  s in Ireland.  
       
           (b) 
    The   increases   in cable subscripti  on revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) net increases primarily due to (a) higher   ARPU   from broadband internet services, (b) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony services in the   U.K.  , (c) lower   ARPU   resulting from the impact of a   change in the regulations governing payment handling fees that   Virgin Media   charges to its customers in the   U.K.  , which reduced revenue by $9.1 million and $18.6 million, respectively, and (d) higher   ARPU   from video services, as increases in the   U.K.   were only partially offset by decreases in Ireland and (ii) adverse changes in   RGU   mix  .    
       
           (c) 
    The   decreases   in mobile subscription revenue relate to the net effect of (i) lower   ARPU   in the   U.K.  , including declines of $28.0 million and $74.8 million, respectively, in postpaid mobile services revenue due to the continued growth of the   U.K.     Split-contract Program  , (ii) increases in the   average number of postpaid mobile subscribers and (iii) declines in the average number of prepaid mobile subscribers in the   U.K.    
       
           (d) 
    The   increases   in   B2B   revenue are primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in data revenue, primarily attributable to (a) higher volumes and (b) increases of $2.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in the   U.K.   s amortization of deferred upfront fees on   B2B   contracts, (ii) lower voice revenue in the   U.K.  , primarily attributable to declines in usage, and (iii) for the nine-month comparison, an increase in low-margin equipment sales in the   U.K. 

84 

(e) 
    The   increases   in other revenue are largely due to the net effect of (i) increases in mobile handset sales in the   U.K.  , primarily attributable to increases of $8.2 million and $65.7 million, respectively, associated with the   U.K.     Split-contract Program  , (ii) decreases in interconnect revenue in the   U.K.   of $4.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively, primarily due to (a) declines in mobile short message service (or   SMS  ) termination volumes and (b) lower fixed-line telephony termination volumes, (iii) increases in installation revenue in the   U.K.   and (iv) increases in broadcasting revenue in Ireland. The increases in revenue from the   Split-contract Program   are due to the net effect of (1) increased volume associated with the continued growth of the program and (2) lower average revenue per handset sold. 
       
           (f) 
    Represents the estimated impact of (i) the   multi-channel multi-point (microwave) distribution system subscribers in Ireland that have disconnected since we announced the switch-off of this service effective April 2016 and (ii)   the non-cable subscribers in the   U.K.   that we sold in the fourth quarter of 2014 (the   U.K. Non-Cable Disposal  ). The non-cable subscribers were migrated to a third party during the first nine months of 2015. 
       
  As discussed above,   Virgin Media   has reduced certain fees it charges to customers in the   U.K.   as a result of a change in the regulations governing these fees, with the largest reduction effective April 1, 2016. We estimate that these reduced charges will result in a    6 million   (  $8 million  ) reduction of the   U.K.   s cable subscription revenue and operating income for the last three months of 2016 when compared to the corresponding prior-year period. 
    
  The Netherlands.   The   increase (decrease)     in   the Netherlands    revenue during   the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , includes (i) organic   decreases   of   $2.0 million   or   0.3%   and   $43.9 million   or   2.1%  , respectively, and (ii) the impact of   FX  , as set f  orth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   decreases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average num  bers of   RGU  s are attributable to declines in the average numbers of basic video, enhanced video and fixed-line telephony   RGU  s that were only partially offset by increases in the average number of broadband internet   RGU  s. 
       
           (b) 
    The   changes   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to the net effect of (i)   a net increase for the three-month comparison and a net decrease for the nine-month comparison due to   (a) higher   ARPU   from video services and (b) lower   ARPU   from broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) improvements in   RGU   mix. 
       
           (c) 
    The   increases   in mobile subscription revenue are due to the net effect of (i) increases in the average number of mobile subscribers and (ii)   lower   ARPU  . 

85 

(d) 
    The   increases   in   B2B   revenue are primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher revenue from data services and (ii) lower revenue from voice services.  
       
           (e) 
    The decrease in other revenue for the nine-month comparison includes the net effect of (i) an increase due to the favorable impact of $3.3 million of nonrecurring revenue recorded during the first quarter of 2016 following the settlement of prior period amounts, (ii) a decrease in revenue of $1.6 million resulting from the termination of a partner network agreement in the Netherlands shortly after the November 2014 acquisition of   Ziggo   and (iii) a net decrease resulting from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription revenue categories.  
       
  Germany.   The   increases   in Germany s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $33.6 million   or   5.6%   and   $105.7 million   or   5.9%  , respectively, and (ii) the impact of   FX  , as set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Subscription revenue includes revenue from multi-year bulk agreements with landlords or housing associations or with third parties that operate and administer the in-building networks on behalf of housing associations. These bulk agreements, which generally allow for the procurement of the basic video signals at volume-based discounts, provide access to approximately two-thirds of Germany s video subscribers. Germany s bulk agreements are, to a significant extent, medium- and long-term contracts. As of   September 30, 2016  , bulk agreements covering approximately 35% of the video subscribers that Germany serves expire by the end of 2017 or are terminable on 30-days notice. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Germany s 20 largest bulk agreement accounts generated approximately 8% of its total revenue (including estimated amounts billed directly to the building occupants for digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services). No assurance can be given that Germany s bulk agreements will be renewed or extended on financially equivalent terms, or at all. 
       
           (b) 
    Other revenue includes fees received for the carriage of certain channels included in Germany s basic and enhanced video offerings. This channel carriage fee revenue is subject to contracts that expire or are otherwise terminable by either party on various dates ranging from 2016 through 2018. The aggregate amount of revenue related to these channel carriage contracts represented approximately 4% of Germany s total revenue during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . No assurance can be given that these contracts will be renewed or extended on financially equivalent terms, or at all. Also, our ability to increase the aggregate channel carriage fees that Germany receives for each channel is limited through the end of 2016 by certain commitments we made to regulators in connection with the acquisition of Unitymedia BW GmbH. In June 2017, we plan to discontinue our analog video service. We estimate that the discontinuance of this service will reduce Germany s channel carriage revenue and operating income by approximately    30 million   (  $34 million  ) annually.  
     
    86 

(c) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are attributable to increases in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enhanced video   RGU  s that were only partially offset by declines in the average number of basic video   RGU  s. 
       
           (d) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to (i) net increases due to (a) higher   ARPU   from broadband internet and video services and (b) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony services and (ii) improvements in   RGU   mix.  
       
           (e) 
    The   decreases   in other revenue are due to the net effect of (i) increases in installation revenue, (ii) for the nine-month comparison, a decrease due to legislative developments that have reduced the fees we can charge our late-paying customers and (iii) net decreases resulting from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription categories. 
       
  Belgium.   The   increases   in Belgium s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $14.9 million   or   2.2%   and   $73.3 million   or   3.8%  , respectively, (ii) the impact of the   BASE Acquisition   and (iii) the impact of   FX  , as set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are attributable to increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video   RGU  s that were only partially offset by declines in the average number of basic video   RGU  s. 
       
           (b) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to (i) higher   ARPU   from video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and (ii) improvements in   RGU   mix. 
       
           (c) 
    The   increases   in mobile subscription revenue are due to the net effect of (i) increases in the average number of mobile subscribers and (ii) lower   ARPU   due to (a) declines of $3.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in mobile services revenue due to the June 2015 introduction of a   Split-contract Program   and (b) declines in usage. 
       
           (d) 
    The changes in   B2B   revenue are largely due to the net impact of (i) higher revenue from information technology security services and related equipment sales, (ii) lower revenue from mobile services and (iii) higher revenue from data services.  

87 

(e) 
    The   changes   in other revenue are primarily due to (i) a decrease of $4.3 million for the three-month comparison and an increase of $4.8 million for the nine-month comparison in mobile handset sales, (ii) increases in tablet sales of $0.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and (iii) decreases in mobile interconnect revenue due to the net effect of (a) lower   SMS   usage and (b) growth in mobile call volumes. The changes in Belgium s mobile handset sales, which typically generate relatively low or negative margins, include the net impact of (1) a decrease of $3.7 million for the three-month comparison and an increase of $9.4 million for the nine-month comparison in non-subsidized handset sales, including a decrease of $2.6 million in the three-month comparison and an increase of $3.5 million in the nine-month comparison associated with the June 2015 introduction of a   Split-contract Program  , and (2) for the nine-month comparison, a decrease of $3.1 million in subsidized handset sales.

  Switzerland/Austria  .   The   changes   in   Switzerland/Austria   s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $4.9 million   or   1.1%   and   $22.3 million   or   1.7%  , respectively, and (ii) the impact of   FX  , as set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   decreases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are primarily attributable to declines in the average numbers of (i) basic video   RGU  s, (ii) enhanced video   RGU  s in Switzerland and (iii) for the three month-comparison, broadband internet   RGU  s in Switzerland, that were mostly offset by increases in the average numbers of (a) fixed-line telephony   RGU  s and (b) broadband internet   RGU  s in Austria and, for the nine-month comparison, Switzerland. 
       
           (b) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to (i) net increases due to (a) higher   ARPU   from video services, (b) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony services and (c) higher   ARPU   from broadband internet services and (ii) slight improvements in   RGU   mix, as favorable changes in Switzerland were mostly offset by adverse changes in Austria.    
       
           (c) 
    The   increases   in mobile subscription revenue are primarily due to increases in the average number of mobile subscribers. 
       
           (d) 
    The   changes   in other revenue are primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases of $1.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively, in mobile handset sales in Switzerland, which typically generate relatively low margins, including increases of $0.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, associated with the September 2015 introduction of a   Split-contract Program  , and (ii) decreases in installation revenue in Switzerland.  
     
    88 

Central and Eastern Europe.   The   increases   in Central and Eastern Europe s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $10.1 million   or   3.8%   and   $25.4 million   or   3.2%  , respectively, (ii) the impact of an acquisition and (iii) the impact of   FX  , as set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and enhanced video   RGU  s in Romania, Hungary and Poland, (ii) declines in the average numbers of basic video   RGU  s in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, (iii) increases in the average number of   DTH     RGU  s, (iv) increases in the average numbers of basic video and broadband internet   RGU  s in the Czech Republic, (v) declines in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony and enhanced video   RGU  s in the Czech Republic and (vi) increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and, for the nine-month comparison, enhanced video   RGU  s in Slovakia. 
       
           (b) 
    The   decreases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to (i) net decreases due to (a) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services and (b) higher   ARPU   from video services, primarily in Poland, and (ii) to a much lesser extent, adverse changes in   RGU   mix, as adverse changes in Romania were mostly offset by improvements in Hungary. 
       
  CWC  .   The increases in   CWC   s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , are entirely attributable to the May 16, 2016   CWC Acquisition  . Accordingly, we do not separately discuss the changes in the revenue for the   CWC   segment. As further discussed under   Overview   above,   CWC   is experiencing significant competition in all of its markets. 
    
  Effective April 1, 2016,   CWC   began recognizing revenue on a cash, rather than accrual, basis with respect to two of its more significant   B2B   customers due primarily to unfavorable collection experience and unfavorable macroeconomic factors. The aggregate amount billed, but not recognized, with respect to these customers during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.2 million.  

89 

Chile.   The   changes   in Chile s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $12.2 million   or   6.0%   and   $38.0 million   or   6.0%  , respectively, and (ii) the impact of   FX  , as set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are attributable to increases in the average numbers of broadband internet and enhanced video   RGU  s that were only partially offset by declines in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony and basic video   RGU  s. 
       
           (b) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to (i) net increases due to (a) higher   ARPU   from video and broadband internet services and (b) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony services and (ii) improvements in   RGU   mix. In addition, the increase in Chile s cable subscription revenue for the nine-month comparison includes adjustments to reflect the retroactive application of a tariff on ancillary services provided directly to customers for the period from July 2013 through February 2014, including (1) a decrease in revenue of $4.2 million due to the impact of unfavorable adjustments recorded during the first and second quarters of 2016 and (2) an increase in revenue due to the impact of a $2.2 million unfavorable adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2015. 
       
           (c) 
    The   increases   in mobile subscription revenue are due to (i)   increases in the average number of mobile subscribers, as increases in the average number of postpaid mobile subscribers more than offset the decreases in the average number of prepaid mobile subscribers,   and (ii)   higher   ARPU  , primarily due to higher proportions of mobile subscribers on postpaid plans, which generate higher   ARPU   than prepaid plans  . 
       
           (d) 
    The   changes   in other revenue include (i) increases of $1.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in interconnect revenue due to the impacts of unfavorable adjustments recorded during the first and third quarters of 2015 to reflect the retroactive application of a tariff reduction to June 2012 and (ii) decreases in advertising revenue.

Puerto Rico.   The   increases   in Puerto Rico s revenue during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , include (i) organic   increases   of   $0.3 million   or   0.3%   and   $3.9 million   or   1.3%  , respectively, and (ii) the impact of the   Choice Acquisition  , as set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The   increases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in the average numbers of   RGU  s are primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) increases in the average number of fixed-line telephony   RGU  s, (ii) declines in the average number of enhanced video   RGU  s and (iii) increases in the average number of broadband internet   RGU  s. 
              (b) 
    The   decreases   in cable subscription revenue related to changes in   ARPU   are attributable to the net effect of (i) adverse changes in   RGU   mix and (ii) a net increase for the nine-month comparison and a net decrease for the three-month comparison due to (a) higher   ARPU   from broadband internet services and (b) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony and video services.  
              (c) 
    The   increases   in   B2B   revenue are largely due to higher revenue from broadband internet services.

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods include the post-acquisition operating expenses of   BASE  , which was acquired on February 11, 2016. 
       
           (b) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods reflect the post-acquisition operating expenses of   CWC  , which was acquired on May 16, 2016. 
       
           (c) 
    The amount presented for the 2015 nine-month period excludes the pre-acquisition operating expenses of   Choice  , which was acquired on   June 3, 2015  .

General.   Operating expenses include programming and copyright, network operations, mobile access and interconnect, customer operations, customer care, share-based compensation and other costs related to our operations. We do not include share-based compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the operating expenses of our reportable segments as share-based compensation expense is not included in the performance measures of our reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed under   Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results   below. Programming and copyright costs, which represent a significant portion of our operating costs, are expected to rise in future periods as a result of (i) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, (ii) rate increases and (iii) growth in the number of our enhanced video subscribers. In addition, we are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and other costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to costs and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of our operating segments (  non-functional currency expenses  ). Any cost increases that we are not able to pass on to our subscribers through rate increases would result in increased pressure on our operating margins. 

European Operations Division  .   The   European Operations Division   s operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased (decreased)   (  $3.4 million  ) or (  0.2%  ) and   $176.1 million   or   3.8%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These changes include (i) increases of $100.6 million and $261.9 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of the   BASE Acquisition   and other less significant acquisitions and (ii) decreases of $0.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively, attributable to the   U.K. Non-Cable Disposal   and another less significant disposition. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and   FX  , the   European Operations Division   s operating expenses     increased   $9.6 million   or   0.6%   and   $134.8 million   or   2.7%  , respectively. These increases include the following factors: 

Increases in programming and copyright costs of $56.5 million or 10.7% and $178.6 million or 11.5%, respectively, primarily due to increases in   U.K./Ireland   and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. These increases are primarily attributable to higher costs for certain premium and/or basic content, including increases of (i) $8.7 million and $55.2 million, respectively, associated with a sports programming contract entered into in August 2015 in   U.K./Ireland   and (ii) $4.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively, associated with a new Europe-wide programming contract that was entered into in June 2016 with retroactive impact to January 1, 2016. In addition, growth in the number of enhanced video subscribers contributed to the increases in Germany and Belgium; 

Decreases in mobile access and interconnect costs of $10.0 million or 3.7% and $38.1 million or 4.6%, respectively, primarily due to the net effect of (i) declines resulting from lower rates, primarily in   U.K./Ireland  , (ii) lower fixed-line telephony call volumes in   U.K./Ireland   and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, (iii) higher mobile usage in the Netherlands, Switzerland/Austria, Belgium and, for the nine-month comparison,   U.K./Ireland  , (iv) for the nine-month comparison, a $6.6 million decrease in Belgium due to the release of an accrual during the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the settlement of an operational contingency and (v) a $3.9 million increase during each period in Switzerland/Austria as a result of the favorable settlement of an operational contingency during the third quarter of 2015; 

Decreases in personnel costs of $3.9 million or 1.8% and $21.9 million or 3.1%, respectively, due primarily to the net effect of (i) decreased staffing levels in   U.K./Ireland  , Switzerland/Austria and the Netherlands that were only partially offset by increases in Belgium, (ii) annual wage increases and (iii) decreased costs in   U.K./Ireland   resulting from higher proportions of capitalized labor costs associated with the network extension project in the   U.K.  ; 

Increases in network-related expenses of $1.3 million or 0.7% and $13.5 million or 2.5%, respectively. The increase for the three-month comparison is due primarily to the net effect of (i) an increase in network maintenance costs, primarily in Belgium and, to a lesser extent, U.K./Ireland, (ii) a net decrease of $4.4 million in Germany associated with certain reassessments of an accrual during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, (iii) a net decrease of $4.2 million resulting from a favorable adjustment associated with the reassessment of operational contingencies in   U.K./Ireland   that we recorded during the third quarter of 2015 and (iv) lower outsourced labor costs associated with customer-facing activities in Germany. The increase for the nine-month comparison is primarily due to the net effect of (a) an $18.1 million increase resulting from nonrecurring adjustments recorded during the first and second quarters of 2015 to reflect lower local authority charges for certain elements of network infrastructure in the   U.K.  , (b) lower outsourced labor costs associated with customer-facing activities in   U.K./Ireland  , Germany, Switzerland/Austria and the Netherlands,     (c) higher network maintenance costs, as increases in Belgium and Hungary were only partially offset by a decrease in Switzerland/Austria,     (d) a $6.2 million decrease in   U.K./Ireland   associated with the favorable settlement of an operational contingency during the first quarter of 2016,     (e) a net decrease of $4.0 million in Germany associated with the aforementioned accrual reassessments and (f) a decrease of $2.5 million as a result of costs incurred during the first  
     
    94 

half of 2015 associated with network harmonization activities following the acquisition of   Ziggo  . For information regarding the potential for increased charges for network infrastructure in the   U.K.   effective April 1, 2017, see note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements; 

Decreases in bad debt and collection expenses of $4.8 million or 13.5% and $7.2 million or 7.2%, respectively. The decrease for the three-month comparison is primarily related to activity in   U.K./Ireland   and Belgium, while the decrease for the nine-month comparison mainly includes declines in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland/Austria and Hungary that were only partially offset by an increase in Poland; 

An increase (decrease) in mobile handset costs of ($15.8 million) and $5.9 million, respectively. The lower costs for the three-month comparison are primarily due to (i) lower average cost per handset sold in   U.K./Ireland   and (ii) lower mobile handset sales volume, as a decrease in the number of handsets sold in Belgium was only partially offset by an increase in   U.K./Ireland  . The higher mobile handset costs for the nine-month comparison are primarily due to the net effect of (a) higher mobile handset sales volume in   U.K./Ireland   and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland/Austria that were only partially offset by lower handset sales in Belgium and (b) lower average cost per handset sold in   U.K./Ireland  . The lower number of handsets sold in Belgium is primarily attributable to a reduction in subsidized handset promotions;  

Increases in outsourced labor and professional fees of $2.7 million or 3.2% and $4.5 million or 1.7%, respectively. The increase for the three-month comparison is primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher call center costs in   U.K./Ireland   and the Netherlands and (ii) a decrease in consulting costs, as lower consulting costs in Belgium were only partially offset by an increase in   U.K./Ireland  . The increase for the nine-month comparison is primarily due to (a) higher call center costs in   U.K./Ireland   that were only partially offset by lower costs in the Netherlands and (b) higher consulting costs, as an increase in consulting costs in the   European Operations Division   s central operations was only partially offset by decreases in   U.K./Ireland  , Belgium and Switzerland/Austria. The lower call center costs in the Netherlands for the nine-month comparison includes a net decrease of $12.5 million associated with the net impact of third-party costs recorded in 2015 and 2016 related to network and product harmonization activities and certain other third-party customer care costs following the acquisition of   Ziggo  ; and  

A net decrease for the three-month comparison resulting from individually insignificant changes in other operating expense categories. 

LiLAC Division  .   The   LiLAC Division   s operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased   $226.0 million   or   169.7%   and   $341.6 million   or   87.2%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases include increases of $222.4 million and $343.6 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of the   CWC Acquisition   and the   Choice Acquisition  . Excluding the effects of these acquisitions and   FX  , the   LiLAC Division   s operating expenses increased   $1.5 million   or   0.4%   and   $15.9 million   or   2.2%  , respectively. These increases include the following factors:  

Increases in programming and copyright costs of $1.3 million or 2.1% and $11.3 million or 6.1%, respectively, primarily associated with (i) growth in the number of enhanced video subscribers in Chile, (ii) increases arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, after giving effect to the application of hedge accounting for certain derivative instruments that are used to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to Chile s   U.S.   dollar denominated programming contracts, and (iii) increased costs for certain content. A significant portion of Chile s programming contracts are denominated in   U.S.   dollars. During the third quarter of 2016,   CWC   began broadcasting live Premier League games in a number of its markets pursuant to a new multi-year agreement. The cost of the rights to broadcast these games, which did not contribute to the organic increases described in this paragraph, will continue to result in a significant increase to   CWC   s programming costs; 

An increase for the nine-month comparison in integration costs of $3.4 million that were incurred during the second quarter of 2016 to integrate   Columbus   (acquired by   CWC   on March 31, 2015) with   CWC   s operations. These costs are excluded from the   CWC Acquisition   effect and, accordingly, are included in our organic increases;  

Increases in mobile handset costs of $1.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, due to higher mobile handset sales in Chile; 
     
    95 

Decreases in mobile access and interconnect costs of $2.1 million or 14.3% and $1.8 million or 4.8%, respectively, primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) lower mobile access charges and, to a lesser extent, lower mobile usage in Chile and (ii) for the nine-month comparison, a $2.3 million increase in Chile related to a nonrecurring adjustment that was recorded in the prior-year period for a February 2015 tariff decline that was retroactive to May 2014; 

Increases in outsourced labor and professional fees of $1.5 million or 18.7% and $1.7 million or 6.8%, respectively, primarily due to increases in call center costs in Chile;  

Decreases in bad debt and collection expenses of $0.5 million or 4.8% and $1.6 million or 5.5%, respectively; and 

Increases in personnel costs of $0.3 million or 2.2% and $1.0 million or 1.7%, respectively, due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in Chile that were only partially offset by lower staffing levels in Chile. 

SG A Expenses of our Reportable Segments 

96 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods include the post-acquisition SG A expenses of   BASE  , which was acquired on February 11, 2016. 
       
           (b) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods reflect the post-acquisition SG A expenses of   CWC  , which was acquired on May 16, 2016. 
       
           (c) 
    The amount presented for the 2015 nine-month period excludes the pre-acquisition SG A expenses of   Choice  , which was acquired on   June 3, 2015  . 
       
  N.M.   Not Meaningful. 

97 

General.   SG A expenses include human resources, information technology, general services, management, finance, legal, sales and marketing, share-based compensation and other general expenses. We do not include share-based compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the SG A expenses of our reportable segments as share-based compensation expense is not included in the performance measures of our reportable segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed under   Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results   below. As noted under   Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments   above, we are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and other costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to   non-functional currency expenses  .  

European Operations Division  .   The   European Operations Division   s SG A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense)     increased   $38.4 million   or   6.3%   and     $100.6 million   or   5.5%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases include increases of $42.3 million and $109.9 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of the   BASE Acquisition   and other less significant acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and   FX  , the   European Operations Division   s SG A expenses increased   $30.2 million   or   4.7%   and   $53.3 million   or   2.7%  , respectively.     These increases include the following factors: 

Increases in personnel costs of $8.1 million or 3.4% and $29.5 million or 4.0%, respectively, primarily due to (i) increased staffing levels, primarily in   U.K./Ireland  , Germany, the   European Operations Division   s central operations and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland/Austria,     that were only partially offset by decreased staffing levels in the Netherlands     and, for the three-month comparison, Belgium and (ii) annual wage increases; 

An increase of $8.4 million for the nine-month comparison due to the impact of an accrual release recorded during the second quarter 2015 related to the resolution of a contingency associated with universal service obligations in Belgium; 

Increases in facilities expenses of $5.8 million or 11.5% and $7.1 million or 4.7%, respectively, primarily due to higher rent and other facilities-related expenses in   U.K./Ireland   and the   European Operations Division   s central operations; 

Increases in outsourced labor and professional fees of $1.3 million or 3.2% and $6.7 million or 5.7%, respectively, primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease for the three-month comparison and an increase for the nine-month comparison in consulting costs and (ii) increased legal costs in U.K./Ireland and the European Operations Division s central operations. The changes in consulting costs include (a) an increase (decrease) of ($2.6 million) and $2.7 million, respectively, associated with the integration of BASE with our operations in Belgium, (b) decreases of $1.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, associated with integration costs incurred during the 2015 periods following the acquisition of Ziggo and (c) for the nine-month comparison, a net increase resulting from other individually insignificant changes; 

An increase (decrease) in sales and marketing costs of $0.1 million or 0.1% and ($1.6 million) or (0.2%), respectively, primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher third-party sales commissions, as increases in Germany and   U.K./Ireland   more than offset declines in the Netherlands, (ii) lower costs associated with advertising campaigns, (iii) for the nine-month comparison, lower third-party costs in the Netherlands of $4.0 million related to the impact of rebranding costs incurred during the 2015 period following the acquisition of Ziggo and (iv) a net increase of $0.9 million in each period in Germany due to the impact of accrual releases recorded in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 associated with the reassessment of an operational contingency, including lower costs of $2.7 million and $3.6 million during the 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. For the three-month comparison, the lower costs associated with advertising campaigns are primarily attributable to lower costs in Belgium that were only partially offset by higher costs in Switzerland/Austria. For the nine-month comparison, lower costs associated with advertising campaigns are due primarily to lower costs in   U.K./Ireland  , Switzerland/Austria and the Netherlands that were only partially offset by higher costs in Belgium; and 

Net increases resulting from individually insignificant changes in other SG A expense categories.

LiLAC Division  .   The   LiLAC Division   s SG A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased   $131.2 million   or   280.9%   and   $205.4 million   or   137.6%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases include increases of     $129.8 million and $210.6 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of the   CWC Acquisition   and the   Choice Acquisition  . Excluding the effects of these acquisitions and   FX  , the   LiLAC Division   s SG A expenses increased   $0.6 million   or   0.4%   and   $1.6 million   or   0.4%  , respectively. These increases include the following factors: 

Decreases in outsourced labor and professional fees of $5.0 million or 16.2% and $4.8 million or 4.2%, respectively, primarily due to a decrease of $5.1 million in each period resulting from the reversal by Liberty Puerto Rico of its previously-recorded provision and related indemnification asset relating to the   PRTC Claim   that was recorded in connection with the acquisition of   OneLink  , as further described in note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements; 

Increases in integration costs of $1.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, incurred during the second and third quarters of 2016 to integrate   Columbus   (acquired by   CWC   on March 31, 2015) with   CWC   s operations and   CWC   s operations with   Liberty Global   and the   LiLAC Division  .     These costs are excluded from the   CWC Acquisition   effect and, accordingly, are included in our organic increases;  

Increases in personnel costs of $1.5 million or 9.4% and $2.6 million or 5.5%, respectively, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and increased wages in Chile;  

Decreases in facilities-related costs of $0.3 million or 5.6% and $1.3 million or 9.3%, respectively, primarily due to lower facilities maintenance in Chile; and 

Net increases from individually insignificant changes in other SG A expense categories.

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods include the post-acquisition   Adjusted OIBDA   of   BASE  , which was acquired on February 11, 2016. 
       
           (b) 
    The amounts presented for the 2016 periods reflect the post-acquisition   Adjusted OIBDA   of   CWC  , which was acquired on May 16, 2016. 
       
           (c) 
    The amount presented for the 2015 nine-month period excludes the pre-acquisition   Adjusted OIBDA   of   Choice  , which was acquired on   June 3, 2015  .

  N.M.   Not Meaningful. 
    
  In addition to organic changes in the revenue, operating expenses and SG A expenses of our reportable segments, the   Adjusted OIBDA   margins presented above include the impact of acquisitions, the most significant of which are the   CWC Acquisition  , the   BASE Acquisition   and the   Choice Acquisition  . In this regard, the   Adjusted OIBDA   margins of Belgium during 2016 were adversely impacted by the inclusion of   BASE  , while the 2016   Adjusted OIBDA   margins of our Puerto Rico operation were positively impacted by realized synergies with respect to the   Choice Acquisition  .     For discussion of the factors contributing to other changes in the   Adjusted OIBDA   margins of our reportable segments, see the above analyses of the revenue, operating expenses and SG A expenses of our reportable segments.

Revenue 
    
  Our revenue by major category is set forth below: 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period. 

103 

ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue. 
    
           (c) 
    B2B   revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, mobile and data services offered to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide services to certain   SOHO   subscribers.   SOHO   subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. Revenue from   SOHO   subscribers, which is included in subscription revenue, aggregated   $132.7 million   and   $78.7 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $356.7 million   and   $213.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. On an organic basis, our total   B2B   revenue, including revenue from   SOHO   subscribers, increased 7.1% and 8.7% for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. A portion of the increase in our   SOHO   revenue is attributable to the conversion of our residential subscribers to   SOHO   subscribers. 
       
           (d) 
    Other revenue includes, among other items,   mobile handset sales, interconnect, channel carriage fee and installation revenue  . 
       
  Total revenue.   Our consolidated revenue   increased     $609.8 million   and   $1,188.5 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases include (i) increases of $745.2 million and $1,349.1 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of acquisitions and (ii) decreases of $5.1 million and $26.4 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of dispositions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and   FX  , our consolidated revenue   increased     $128.3 million   or   2.4%   and   $408.0 million   or   2.7%  , respectively.  
    
  Subscription revenue.   The details of the changes in our consolidated subscription revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , are as follows:    

Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and   FX  , our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased   $115.8 million   or   3.1%   and   $282.7 million   or   2.5%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases are attributable to the net effect of (i) increases from broadband internet services of   $72.8 million   or   5.4%   and   $246.6 million   or   6.3%  , respectively, attributable to increases in the average number of broadband internet   RGU  s and higher   ARPU   from broadband internet services, (ii) increases from video services of   $58.7 million   or   3.6%   and   $78.9 million   or   1.6%  , respectively, attributable to the net effect of (a) higher   ARPU   from video services and (b) declines in the average number of video   RGU  s and (iii) decreases from fixed-line telephony services of   $15.7 million   or   1.9%   and   $42.8 million   or   1.8%  , respectively, attributable to the net effect of (1) lower   ARPU   from fixed-line telephony services and (2) increases in the average number of fixed-line telephony   RGU  s. 
    
  Excluding the effects of acquisitions and   FX  , our consolidated mobile subscription revenue decreased   $6.6 million   or   1.2%   and   $16.0 million   or   1.2%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These decreases are largely due to the net effect of (i) declines in the U.K., largely associated with the continued growth of the U.K.   Split-contract Program  , and (ii) increases in Belgium and Switzerland. 
  
    104 

B2B   revenue.   Excluding the effects of acquisitions and   FX  , our consolidated   B2B   revenue increased   $10.3 million   or   1.6%   and   $45.7 million   or   3.0%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases are primarily due to increases in the   U.K.  , Belgium and Puerto Rico. 
    
  Other revenue.   Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and   FX  , our consolidated other revenue increased   $8.8 million   or   2.3%   and   $95.6 million   or   9.7%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases are largely attributable to increases in mobile handset sales, mainly associated with the continued growth of   Split-contract Program  s, primarily in the U.K.

ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and revenue from mobile handset sales are included in other revenue. 
    
           (b) 
    Revenue from   SOHO   subscribers, which is included in subscription revenue, aggregated   $9.2 million   and   $5.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $22.1 million   and   $15.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. On an organic basis, the   LiLAC Group   s total   B2B   revenue, including revenue from   SOHO   subscribers, increased 0.9% and 1.6% for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. 
       
  N.M.   Not Meaningful. 
    
  Operating expenses 
    
  Our operating expenses increased   $220.1 million   and   $510.5 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases include (i) increases of $323.0 million and $605.4 million, respectively, attributable to the impact of the   CWC Acquisition  , the   BASE Acquisition  , the   Choice Acquisition   and other less significant acquisitions and (ii)     decreases of     $1.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively, attributable to the   U.K. Non-Cable Disposal   and other less significant dispositions.     Our operating expenses include share-based compensation expense, which remained relatively unchanged during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . For additional information, see the discussion under   Share-based compensation expense   below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions,   FX   and share-based compensation expense, our operating expenses increased   $9.0 million   or   0.4%   and   $150.0 million   or   2.7%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases are primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) increases in programming and copyright costs, (b) decreases in mobile access and interconnect costs, (c) decreases in personnel costs, (d) increases in network-related expenses and (e) decreases in bad debt and collection expenses.     Certain of these changes include (1) decreases in integration-related costs in the Netherlands that aggregate to $0.1 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and (2) an increase in integration-related costs of $3.4 million during the nine-month comparison that were incurred by   CWC   in connection with the integration of   Columbus   with   CWC   s operations. For additional information regarding the changes in our operating expenses, see   Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments   Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments   above. 
    
  SG A expenses 
    
  Our SG A expenses     increased   $104.8 million     and   $269.8 million     during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases include increases of $172.1 million and $320.6 million, respectively,     attributable to the impact of the   CWC Acquisition  , the   BASE Acquisition  , the   Choice Acquisition   and other less significant acquisitions. Our SG A expenses include share-based compensation expense, which decreased   $62.3 million   and   $46.7 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. For additional information, see the discussion under   Share-based compensation expense   below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions,   FX   and share-based compensation expense, our SG A expenses increased   $30.5 million   or   3.5%   and   $68.5 million   or   2.8%   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases are primarily attributable to (i) increases in personnel costs, (ii) for the nine-month comparison, increases in outsourced labor and professional fees and (iii) increases in facilities expenses. Certain of these changes include (a) decreases in     integration-related costs in the Netherlands that aggregate to $1.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively, (b) increases (decreases) in integration-related costs in Belgium that aggregate to ($2.3 million) and $4.3 million, respectively, and (c) increases in integration-related costs associated with   CWC   that aggregate to $3.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, including $1.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, incurred by   CWC   in connection with the integration of   Columbus   with   CWC   s operations and   CWC   s operations with   Liberty Global   and the   LiLAC Division  . For additional information regarding the changes in our SG A expenses, see   Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments   SG A Expenses of our Reportable Segments   above  .

Share-based compensation expense (included in operating and SG A expenses) 
    
  Our share-based compensation expense primarily relates to the share-based incentive awards issued by   Liberty Global   to its employees and employees of its subsidiaries. A summary of the aggregate share-based compensation expense that is included in our operating and SG A expenses is set forth below:  

_______________  
    
           (a) 
    Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i)   PSU  s, including the   2016 PSUs  , (ii) for the nine-month period,   Challenge Performance Awards   and (iii)   PGUs  . 
       
           (b) 
    In connection with the   LiLAC Transaction  , the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the   2015 Award Modifications   in accordance with the underlying share-based incentive plans. As a result of the   2015 Award Modifications  , the Black-Scholes fair values of our options,   SAR  s and   PSAR  s increased, resulting in incremental share-based compensation expense of $99.3 million, of which $63.5 million was recognized during the third quarter of 2015 related to awards that vested on or prior to September 30, 2015. 
       
  For additional information regarding our share-based compensation, see note   10   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

108 

Depreciation and amortization expense  
    
  The details of our depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:       

Excluding the effects of   FX  , depreciation and amortization expense increased $50.4 million or 3.5% and $193.7 million or 4.4% during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These     increases are primarily due to the net effect of (i)     increases associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives, (ii) decreases associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, primarily in   U.K./Ireland  , the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent,   Switzerland/Austria  , Chile, Belgium and Germany, (iii) increases associated with acquisitions, primarily as a result of the   CWC Acquisition   and   BASE Acquisition  , and (iv) decreases in the Netherlands as a result of the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities   effective August 3, 2016. For information regarding the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities  , see note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net  
    
  The details of our impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, are as follows:       

The total   2016   amounts include (i) direct acquisition costs of   $8.9 million   and   $142.3 million  , respectively, largely related to the   CWC Acquisition   and, to a lesser extent, the   BASE Acquisition   and the   Dutch JV  , and (ii) restructuring charges of   $27.4 million   and   $111.7 million  , respectively, including   $26.8 million   and   $105.5 million  , respectively, of employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in Germany,   U.K./Ireland  , the   European Operations Division   s central operations, Chile and, for the nine-month period, the Netherlands. 
    
  The total for the   2015   three-month period includes (i) a $23.1 million loss on the divestiture of our   Film1   channels in connection with the acquisition of   Ziggo  , (ii) restructuring charges of $18.8 million, including $15.6 million of employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in the Netherlands and   U.K./Ireland  , and  
  
    109 

(iii) direct acquisition costs of $16.9 million, a portion of which was incurred in connection with our acquisition of additional shares of   ITV   and the   BASE Acquisition  . 
    
  The total for the   2015   nine-month period includes (i) restructuring charges of $50.1 million, including $42.3 million of employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland/Austria and Puerto Rico, (ii) direct acquisition costs of $31.6 million, largely related to the   BASE Acquisition  , the   Choice Acquisition  , the acquisition of   Ziggo   and our acquisition of additional shares of   ITV  , (iii) impairment charges of $20.7 million, primarily in U.K./Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland/Austria, and (iv) a loss from the disposition of assets of $3.3 million, including a $23.1 million loss on the divestiture of our   Film1   channels and a $12.0 million gain in U.K./Ireland. 
    
  For information regarding the   CWC Acquisition  , the   BASE Acquisition   and the   Dutch JV  , see note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We expect to continue to record significant restructuring charges over the next 12 months, due largely to our ongoing company-wide effort to optimize our operating model. In addition, we expect to undertake further restructuring programs in certain of our operating segments, including programs in connection with the integration of acquired entities.  
    
  For additional information regarding our restructuring charges, see note   11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant. 

Interest expense 
    
  The details of our interest expense are as follows:  

_______________ 
    
  N.M.   Not Meaningful. 
  
    110 

Excluding the effects of   FX  , interest expense increased $23.9 million or 3.9% and $59.1 million or 3.2%, respectively.     These increases are primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) higher average outstanding debt balances, largely due to debt incurred in connection with the   CWC Acquisition   and the   BASE Acquisition  , and (ii)     lower weighted average interest rates related to the completion of certain financing transactions that resulted in extended maturities and decreases to certain of our interest rates.     For additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
       
  It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note   4   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and under   Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk   below, we use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks. 
    
  Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net 
    
  Our realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments include (i) unrealized changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments that are non-cash in nature until such time as the derivative contracts are fully or partially settled and (ii) realized gains or losses upon the full or partial settlement of the derivative contracts.

 _______________  
    
           (a) 
    The loss     during the   2016     three-month period   is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) losses associated with an increase in the value of the euro relative to the   U.S.   dollar, (ii) gains associated with a decrease in the value of the British pound sterling relative to the   U.S.   dollar, (iii) losses associated with increases in market interest rates in the   U.S.   dollar market and (iv) losses associated with decreases in market interest rates in the euro, the British pound sterling and the Chilean peso markets. The loss during the   2016     nine-month period   is primarily attributable to the net effect of (a) losses associated with decreases in market interest rates in the British pound sterling, euro and Chilean peso markets, (b) gains associated with a decrease in the value of the British pound sterling relative to the   U.S.   dollar, (c) losses associated with  
     
    111 

increases in the values of the euro, the Chilean peso and the Swiss franc relative to the   U.S.   dollar, and (d) gains associated with decreases in market interest rates in the   U.S.   dollar market. In addition, the gain (loss) during the   2016   periods include net gains of   $80.4 million   and   $87.5 million  , respectively, resulting from changes in our credit risk valuation adjustments. The gain during the   2015     three-month period   is primarily attributable to the net effect of (1) gains associated with decreases in the values of the British pound sterling and Chilean peso relative to the   U.S.   dollar, (2) gains associated with decreases in market interest rates in the   U.S.   dollar market, (3) losses associated with decreases in market interest rates in the euro and British pound sterling markets and (4) gains associated with a decrease in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the euro. The gain during the   2015     nine-month period   is primarily attributable to the net effect of (I) gains associated with decreases in the values of the euro, British pound sterling and Chilean peso relative to the   U.S.   dollar, (II) gains associated with decreases in market interest rates in the   U.S.   dollar market, (III) losses associated with an increase in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the euro, (IV) gains associated with increases in market interest rates in the Chilean peso market and (V) losses associated with decreases in market interest rates in the Swiss franc market. In addition, the gains during the   2015   periods include a net gain (loss) of (  $29.9 million  ) and   $30.4 million  , respectively, resulting from changes in our credit risk valuation adjustments.

    The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include gains of $5.6 million and $84.4 million, respectively, related to an investment that was sold during the third quarter of 2016. 
       
  Losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net 

The net loss during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is attributable to (i) the payment of redemption premium of   $66.2 million   (including   $34.2 million   during the third quarter), (ii) the write-off of net unamortized premium of   $2.6 million   (including   $16.4 million   of unamortized discount during the third quarter), (iii) the write-off of deferred financing costs of   $22.9 million   (including   $14.2 million   during the third quarter) and (iv) a loss related to the settlement of portions of the   Sumitomo Collar   and the   Sumitomo Collar Loan   of   $2.2 million  .  
    
  The loss during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is attributable to (i) the payment of redemption premium of   $308.3 million   (including   $34.3 million   during the third quarter), (ii) the write-off of deferred financing costs of   $63.1 million  , (iii) the write-off of unamortized discount of   $10.4 million   and (iv) the payment of third-party costs of   $0.8 million  .

Other income (expense), net 
    
  The details of our other income (expense), net, are as follows: 

The total   2016   amounts include (i) expense of $16.9 million and $72.1 million, respectively, representing our share of the results of affiliates, and (ii) interest income of $15.8 million and $36.6 million, respectively. In addition, the 2016 nine-month amount includes income of   $69.8 million  , representing our share of the settlement of certain litigation between   Vivendi   and   Liberty Media  , as further described in note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The total   2015   amounts include (i) expense of $15.6 million and $38.8 million, respectively, representing our share of the results of affiliates, and (ii) interest income of $11.4 million and $33.4 million, respectively. 
    
  Income tax benefit (expense) 
    
  The details of our income tax benefit (expense) are as follows: 

The income tax expense during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   differs from the expected income tax benefit of   $19.1 million   (based on the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate of   20.0%  ) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) a reduction in net deferred tax assets in the   U.K.   due to enacted changes in tax law and (ii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items. The net negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) the tax effect of intercompany financing, (b) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results and (c) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate. 
    
  The income tax benefit during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   differs from the expected income tax expense of   $27.6 million   (based on the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate of   20.0%  ) primarily due to the net positive impact of (i) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results, (ii) the tax effect of intercompany financing, (iii) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate and (iv) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. The net positive impact of these items was partially offset by the net negative impact of (a) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and (b) an increase in valuation allowances. 
    
  The income tax expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differs from the expected income tax benefit of   $70.4 million   (based on the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate of   20.0%  ) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) a reduction in net deferred tax assets in the   U.K.   due to enacted changes in tax law, (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items and (iv) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates.  
  
    115 

The net negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results, (b) the tax effect of intercompany financing and (c) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate. 
    
  The income tax expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   differs from the expected income tax benefit of   $148.3 million   (based on the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate of   20.0%  ) primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) an increase in valuation allowances, (ii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items. The net negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of (a) the tax effect of intercompany financing, (b) statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that are different than the   U.K.   statutory income tax rate and (c) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. 
    
  For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note   8   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Net earnings (loss) 
    
  The details of our net earnings (loss) are as follows: 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we reported net earnings (loss) of (  $205.1 million  ) and   $140.6 million  , respectively, including (i) operating income of   $902.7 million   and   $545.5 million  , respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of   $998.3 million   and   $407.4 million  , respectively, and (iii) income tax     benefit (expense) of (  $109.5 million  ) and   $2.5 million  , respectively. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we reported net losses     of   $468.7 million   and   $791.0 million  , respectively, including (i) operating income of   $1,977.1 million   and   $1,727.9 million  , respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of   $2,329.2 million   and   $2,469.3 million  , respectively, and (iii) income tax expense of   $116.6 million   and   $49.6 million  , respectively. 
    
  Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in foreign currency exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such, any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings is largely dependent on our ability to increase our aggregate   Adjusted OIBDA   to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) share-based compensation expense, (b) depreciation and amortization, (c) impairment, restructuring and other operating items, (d) interest expense, (e) other non-operating expenses and (f) income tax expenses. 
    
  Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under   Material Changes in Financial Condition       Capitalization   below, we expect that we will continue to report significant levels of interest expense for the foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect certain aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under   Overview   above. For information concerning the reasons for changes in specific line items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, see the discussion under   Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments   and   Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results   above.  

116 

Net earnings     attributable to noncontrolling interests 
    
  The details of our net earnings     attributable to noncontrolling interests are as follows: 

The changes in net     earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , are primarily attributable to the results of operations of (i)   Telenet   and (ii)   CWC   following the   CWC Acquisition  .

Material Changes in Financial Condition 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements at the corporate level. Although our consolidated operating subsidiaries generate cash from operating activities, each of our significant operating subsidiaries is included within one of our nine subsidiary  borrowing groups.  These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within   Virgin Media  ,   Ziggo Group Holding  ,   Unitymedia  ,   UPC Holding  ,   Telenet  ,   CWC  ,   Columbus  ,   VTR Finance   and   Liberty Puerto Rico  . As set forth in the table below, our borrowing groups accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016  . The terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowing groups restrict our ability to access the liquidity of these subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests, foreign currency exchange restrictions and other factors.  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents 
    
  The details of the   U.S.   dollar equivalent balances of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   are set forth in the following table (in millions): 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Represents the amount held by   Liberty Global   on a standalone basis, which is attributed to the   Liberty Global Group  . 
       
           (b) 
    Represents the aggregate amount held by subsidiaries attributed to the   Liberty Global Group   that are outside of our borrowing groups.  
       
           (c) 
    The   Virgin Media   borrowing group includes certain subsidiaries of   Virgin Media  , but excludes   Virgin Media  . The   $0.3 million   of cash and cash equivalents held by   Virgin Media   is included in the amount shown for the   Liberty Global Group   s unrestricted subsidiaries. 
     
    118 

(d) 
    Represents the aggregate amount held by subsidiaries attributed to the   LiLAC Group   that are outside of our borrowing groups.  
       
           (e) 
    Except as otherwise noted, represents the aggregate amounts held by the parent entity and restricted subsidiaries of our borrowing groups. 
       
           (f) 
    Amount includes $78.0 million held by   Columbus   and its subsidiaries, which together constitute a separate borrowing group within   CWC  . 
       
  Liquidity of   Liberty Global   and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
    
  The   $26.7 million   of cash and cash equivalents held by   Liberty Global   and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, the   $473.3 million   of aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by the unrestricted subsidiaries attributed to the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group  , represented available liquidity at the corporate level at   September 30, 2016  . Our remaining cash and cash equivalents of   $477.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   were held by our borrowing groups as set forth in the table above. As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the cash of our borrowing groups. For information regarding certain limitations imposed by our subsidiaries  debt instruments at   September 30, 2016  , see note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by   Liberty Global   and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations,   Liberty Global   s unrestricted subsidiaries, and (ii) interest and dividend income received on our and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents and investments. In addition, our parent entity s short-term liquidity is supplemented by interest payments that it receives on a note receivable from one of our unrestricted subsidiaries (outstanding principal of $9.6 billion at   September 30, 2016  , all outstanding principal due in 2021).  
    
  From time to time,   Liberty Global   and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of distributions or loan repayments from   Liberty Global   s borrowing groups or affiliates upon (a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings, asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of   Liberty Global   and its unrestricted subsidiaries and (iii) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt by   Liberty Global   or its unrestricted subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by   Liberty Global  , including equity securities issued to satisfy subsidiary obligations. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to   Liberty Global   or its unrestricted subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all. Upon the formation of the   Dutch JV  , we will receive a significant amount of cash, and the debt and capital lease obligations of the   Dutch JV Entities   will no longer be included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. For additional information, see notes   3   and   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In addition, the amount of cash we receive from our subsidiaries to satisfy   U.S.   dollar-denominated liquidity requirements is impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly with regard to the translation of British pounds sterling and euros into   U.S.   dollars. In this regard, the strengthening (weakening) of the   U.S.   dollar against these currencies will result in decreases (increases) in the   U.S.   dollars received from the applicable subsidiaries to fund the repurchase of our equity securities and other   U.S.   dollar-denominated liquidity requirements. In addition, the   U.S.   dollar has significantly strengthened against the British pound sterling during the period following Brexit. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance includes   $930.6 million   that is held by entities that are domiciled outside of the   U.K.   Based on our assessment of our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis and our expectations with respect to our corporate liquidity requirements, we do not anticipate that tax considerations will adversely impact our corporate liquidity over the next 12 months. Our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis is a consideration in assessing the extent of our share repurchase program. 
    
  Our corporate liquidity requirements include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses, (ii) interest payments on the   Sumitomo Collar Loan   and the   Sumitomo Share Loan   and (iii) principal payments on our secured borrowing arrangement with respect to our   ITV   shares (the   ITV Collar Loan  ), the   Sumitomo Collar Loan  , the   Sumitomo Share Loan   and our secured borrowing arrangement with respect to   2.5 million   of our   Lionsgate   shares (the   Lionsgate Loan  ) to the extent not settled through the delivery of the underlying shares. In addition,   Liberty Global   and its unrestricted subsidiaries may require cash in connection with (a) the repayment of third-party and intercompany debt, (b) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (c) acquisitions, (d) the repurchase of equity and debt securities, (e) other investment opportunities or (f) income tax payments. In addition, our  
  
    119 

parent entity uses available liquidity to make interest and principal payments on notes payable to certain of our unrestricted subsidiaries (aggregate outstanding principal of $3,335.8 million     at   September 30, 2016   and no stated maturity). For information regarding the liquidity impacts of the pending creation of the   Dutch JV  , see note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For information regarding our commitments and contingencies, see note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we purchased a total of   25,686,822   Class A   Liberty Global Shares   at a weighted average price of   $32.36   and   23,700,789   Class C   Liberty Global Shares   at a weighted average price of   $33.09   for an aggregate purchase price of   $1,615.6 million  , including direct acquisition costs and the effects of derivative instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was   $2,393.3 million  .  
    
  Liquidity of borrowing groups 
    
  The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of such entities at   September 30, 2016  , see note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by contributions and/or loans from   Liberty Global   and its unrestricted subsidiaries. The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally is used to fund property and equipment additions and debt service requirements. From time to time, our borrowing groups may also require liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to   Liberty Global  , (iii) capital distributions to   Liberty Global   and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingencies. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. For information regarding our borrowing groups  contingencies, see note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows   below. 
    
  Capitalization 
    
  We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance (excluding the   ITV Collar Loan  , the   Sumitomo Collar Loan  , the   Sumitomo Share Loan   and the   Lionsgate Loan   and measured using subsidiary debt figures at swapped foreign currency exchange rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements) that is between four and five times our consolidated   Adjusted OIBDA  , although it should be noted that the timing of our acquisitions and financing transactions and the interplay of average and spot foreign currency rates may impact this ratio. The ratio of our   September 30, 2016   consolidated debt (which excludes the debt of   Ziggo Group Holding   due to the application of held-for-sale accounting) to our annualized consolidated   Adjusted OIBDA   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   (as adjusted to exclude the   Adjusted OIBDA   of   Ziggo Group Holding   and   Ziggo Sport   for the full quarter) was 5.0x. In addition, the ratio of our   September 30, 2016   consolidated net debt (debt, as defined above, less cash and cash equivalents) to our annualized consolidated   Adjusted OIBDA   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   (as adjusted to exclude the   Adjusted OIBDA   of   Ziggo Group Holding   and   Ziggo Sport   for the full quarter) was     4.8x.  
    
  When it is cost effective, we generally seek to match the denomination of the borrowings of our subsidiaries with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings. As further discussed in note   4     to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we also use derivative instruments to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments.  
    
  Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the   Adjusted OIBDA   of our operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the   Adjusted OIBDA   of   UPC Broadband Holding   were to decline, we could be required to partially repay or limit our borrowings under the   UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility   in order to maintain compliance with applicable covenants. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources of liquidity, or that any external funding would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such required repayment. At   September 30, 2016  , each of our borrowing groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance  
  
    120 

with respect to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12 months.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our capital lease obligations, aggregated   $44.2 billion  , including $2,154.5 million that is classified as current in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and   $39.5 billion   that is not due until 2021 or thereafter. For additional information concerning our current debt maturities, see note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Notwithstanding our negative working capital position at   September 30, 2016  , we believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. However, (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity. 
    
  All of our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For additional information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
    
  General.   Our cash flows are subject to significant variations due to   FX  .  
    
  Summary.   Our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are summarized as follows: 

121 

Operating Activities.   Our net cash flows from operating activities are as follows: 

The   decrease   in total net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash provided due to higher payments of interest, (ii) an increase in cash provided due to higher cash receipts related to derivative instruments, (iii) an increase in the cash provided by our   Adjusted OIBDA   and related working capital items due to the impact of the acquisition of CWC and (iv) a decrease in cash provided due to higher payments for taxes. 
    
  Investing Activities.   Our net cash flows from investing activities are as follows: 

The     increase     in total net cash used by our investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in cash used of   $1,046.2 million   associated with higher cash paid in connection with acquisitions,     (ii) a decrease in cash used of   $681.1 million   associated with lower cash paid related to investments in and loans to affiliates and others, (iii) a decrease in cash used of   $137.8 million   as a result of cash proceeds received from the sale of investments, (iv) an increase in cash used of   $93.5 million   due to higher capital expenditures and (v) a decrease in cash used of   $69.8 million   as a result of cash proceeds received in connection with the   Vivendi   settlement, as further described in note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures   increased   from   $1,851.5 million   during the first   nine   months of   2015   to   $1,945.0 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016   due to the     net effect of (a) a decrease resulting from   FX  , (b) an increase resulting from acquisitions and (c) a net increase in the local currency capital expenditures of our subsidiaries, including a decrease associated with higher capital-related vendor financing. 

122 

The capital expenditures that we report in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid. In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements, and (ii) our total property and equipment additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. For further details regarding our property and equipment additions, see note   14   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is set forth below: 

The property and equipment additions attributable to the   Liberty Global Group   are primarily related to the   European Operations Division  , which accounted for   $3,105.5 million     and   $2,769.1 million   of   Liberty Global Group   s property and equipment additions during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   increase     in the   European Operations Division   s property and equipment additions is primarily due to the     net effect of (i) an increase in expenditures for new build and upgrade projects,     (ii) a decrease due to   FX  , (iii) an increase in expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems, (iv) an increase due to the impact of the   BASE Acquisition   and (v) an increase in expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment. 
  Property and equipment additions attributable to the   LiLAC Group   increased     during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  , primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase due to the impacts of the   CWC Acquisition   and the   Choice Acquisition  , (ii) an increase in expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment, (iii) an increase in expenditures for new build and upgrade projects, (iv) a decrease due to   FX   and (v) an increase in expenditures for support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems.     During the first   nine   months of   2016  , approximately 43% of   VTR   s purchases of property and equipment were denominated in   U.S.   dollars. 
  Including   BASE   and   CWC  , but excluding   Ziggo Group Holding  , we expect the percentage of revenue represented by our aggregate 2016 consolidated property and equipment additions to range from 25% to 27%, including (i) 26% to 28% for the   Liberty Global Group   and (ii) 19% to 21% for the   LiLAC Group  . These ranges reflect changes from the expectations disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which included   Ziggo Group Holding   and excluded   BASE   and   CWC  . In this regard, the range for the   Liberty Global Group   represents an increase from our previously-reported expectation of 25% to 27% and the range for the   LiLAC Group   represents a decrease from our previously-reported expectation of 21% to 23%. The range for   Liberty Global   on a consolidated basis remains unchanged from our previously-reported expectations. The actual amount of our 2016 consolidated property and equipment additions and the 2016 property and equipment additions of the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   may vary from expected amounts for a variety of reasons, including (a) changes in (1) the competitive or regulatory environment, (2) business plans, (3) our current or expected future operating results or (4) foreign currency exchange rates and (b) the availability of sufficient capital.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our actual property and equipment additions will not vary materially from our expectations.

Financing Activities.   Our net cash flows from financing activities are as follows: 

The     decrease     in total net cash     used by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash used of   $259.3 million   due to lower payments related to derivative instruments,     (ii) an increase in cash used of   $247.6 million   related to lower net borrowings of debt,     (iii) a decrease in cash used of   $246.1 million   due to lower payments for financing costs and debt premiums, (iv) a decrease in cash used of   $142.2 million   related lower to purchases of additional shares of our subsidiaries,     (v) a decrease in cash used of   $130.3 million   associated with call option contracts on Liberty Global ordinary shares and     (vi) an increase in cash used of   $99.6 million   due to higher repurchases of Liberty Global ordinary shares. 
    
  Adjusted free cash flow 
    
  We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by our operating activities, plus (i) excess tax benefits related to the exercise of share-based incentive awards, (ii) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions and (iii) expenses financed by an intermediary, less (a) capital expenditures, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and (c) principal payments on capital leases (exclusive of the portions of the network lease in Belgium and the duct leases in Germany that we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions), with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. We believe that our presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Adjusted free cash flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view adjusted free cash flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for,   U.S. GAAP   measures of liquidity included in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  The following table provides the details of our adjusted free cash flow: 

124 

_______________ 
    
           (a) 
    Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation represent the excess of tax deductions over the related financial reporting share-based compensation expense. The hypothetical cash flows associated with these excess tax benefits are reported as an increase to cash flows from financing activities and a corresponding decrease to cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
       
           (b) 
    For purposes of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, expenses financed by an intermediary are treated as hypothetical operating cash outflows and hypothetical financing cash inflows when the expenses are incurred. When we pay the financing intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our adjusted free cash flow definition, we add back the hypothetical operating cash outflow when these financed expenses are incurred and deduct the financing cash outflows when we pay the financing intermediary. 
       
  Contractual Commitments 
    
  The following table sets forth the   U.S.   dollar equivalents of our commitments as of   September 30, 2016  . With the exception of debt, capital leases and the related projected interest payments (which include   CWC   amounts), the commitments of   CWC   have been excluded from the table pending our verification of the amounts. These excluded commitments are not expected to be material in relation to our total commitments. Due to the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities   at September 30, 2016, the amounts presented below do not include the maturities of the debt and capital lease obligations, contractual commitments or the related projected cash interest payments of these entities. For information regarding the held-for-sale presentation of the   Dutch JV Entities  , see note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

_______________  
    
           (a) 
    The commitments included in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our   September 30, 2016   condensed consolidated balance sheet other than debt and capital lease obligations. Our liability for uncertain tax positions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate ($464.7 million     at   September 30, 2016  ,   including $81.7 million     related to   CWC   and its subsidiaries) has been excluded from the table as the amount and timing of any related payments are not subject to reasonable estimation.  
       
           (b) 
    Amounts are based on interest rates, interest payment dates, commitment fees and contractual maturities in effect as of  
     
    125 

September 30, 2016  . These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from the actual cash payments required in future periods. In addition, the amounts presented do not include the impact of our interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts.  
    
  For information concerning our debt and capital lease obligations, see note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For information concerning our commitments, see note   13   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For information regarding projected cash flows associated with our derivative instruments, see   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivative Instruments   below  .   For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , see note   4   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  General    
    
  The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion that appears under   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion updates selected numerical information to   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various foreign countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. 
    
  Cash 
    
  We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of our and our subsidiaries  short-term liquidity requirements. In order to mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in light of our and our subsidiaries  forecasted liquidity requirements. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $697.0 million   or   71.3%  ,   $103.9 million   or   10.6%   and   $98.0 million   or   10.0%   of our consolidated cash balances were denominated in   U.S.   dollars,   Chilean pesos   and   euros  , respectively. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
    
  The relationship between (i) the euro, the British pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Hungarian forint, the Polish zloty, the Czech koruna, the Romanian lei, the Chilean peso and the Jamaican dollar and (ii) the   U.S.   dollar, which is our reporting currency, is shown below, per one   U.S.   dollar:  

127 

Interest Rate Risks 
    
  In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Accordingly, we have entered into various derivative transactions to reduce exposure to increases in interest rates. We use interest rate derivative contracts to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We also use interest rate cap and collar agreements that lock in a maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from declines in market rates. At   September 30, 2016  , we effectively paid a fixed interest rate on 96%     of our total debt. The final maturity dates of our various portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments generally fall short of the respective maturities of the underlying variable-rate debt. In this regard, we use judgment to determine the appropriate maturity dates of our portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments, taking into account the relative costs and benefits of different maturity profiles in light of current and expected future market conditions, liquidity issues and other factors. For additional information concerning the terms of these interest rate derivative instruments, see note   4   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Sensitivity Information 
    
  Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency. For additional information, see notes   4   and   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Notes to Attributed Financial Information 
  September 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

(  1  ) 
    Attributed Financial Information 
     The terms    LiLAC Group    and    Liberty Global Group    do not represent separate legal entities, rather they represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each group. The   LiLAC Group   comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed to it (i)   LGE Coral   and its subsidiaries, which include   CWC  , (ii)   VTR Finance   and its subsidiaries, which include   VTR  , (iii)   Lila Chile Holding  , which is the parent entity of   VTR Finance  , (iv)   LiLAC Holdings   and its subsidiaries, which include   Liberty Puerto Rico  , and (v) prior to July 1, 2015, the   LiLAC Corporate Costs  . Effective July 1, 2015, the   LiLAC Corporate Costs   were transferred to   LiLAC Holdings  . The   Liberty Global Group   comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities not attributed to the   LiLAC Group  , including   Virgin Media  ,   Ziggo Group Holding  ,   Unitymedia  ,   Telenet  ,   UPC Holding  , our corporate entities (excluding   LiLAC Holdings  ) and certain other less significant entities. Accordingly, the accompanying attributed financial information for the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   includes the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of the respective entities within each group. Any business that we may acquire in the future that we do not attribute to the   LiLAC Group   will be attributed to the   Liberty Global Group  . 
  Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to either the   Liberty Global Group   or the   LiLAC Group   to the other group, without the approval of any of our shareholders, and may use the liquidity of one group to fund the liquidity and capital resource requirements of the other group. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty evaluating the future prospects and liquidity and capital resources of each group. 
   
  (  2  )      Income Taxes 
  We generally have accounted for income taxes for the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   in the accompanying attributed financial information on a separate return basis, as adjusted to reflect the consolidated view of the tax asset, liability, benefit or expense (  tax attribute  ) of each group. Accordingly, except as otherwise noted below, any   tax attribute   associated with an entity attributed to the   Liberty Global Group   has been allocated to the   Liberty Global Group   and any   tax attribute   associated with an entity attributed to the   LiLAC Group   has been allocated to the   LiLAC Group  . 
  Liberty Global   owns consolidated interests in a number of entities that are included in combined or consolidated tax returns, including tax returns in the Netherlands (the   Dutch Fiscal Unity  ), the U.K. (the   U.K. Tax Group  ) and the U.S (the   U.S. Tax Group  ). Different members of the   Liberty Global Group   file combined tax returns for the   Dutch Fiscal Unity   and U.K. tax returns, where sharing of certain tax attributes is permitted, and consolidated tax returns for the   U.S. Tax Group  . Certain entities included in the   Dutch Fiscal Unity  , the   U.K. Tax Group   and the   U.S. Tax Group   are attributed to the   LiLAC Group  . As a result, we record inter-group tax allocations to recognize changes in the   tax attribute  s of certain members of the   LiLAC Group   that are included in the   Dutch Fiscal Unity  , the   U.K. Tax Group   or the   U.S. Tax Group  . Prior to July 1, 2015, the inter-group tax allocations reflected in the attributed financial information were not cash settled and were not the subject of tax sharing agreements. Accordingly, inter-group tax allocations prior to July 1, 2015 are reflected in the attributed financial information as adjustments of equity. Following the adoption of the tax sharing policy described below, certain inter-group tax allocations are expected to be cash settled. 
  Effective July 1, 2015 (the date we distributed the   LiLAC Shares  ), the allocation of tax attributes between the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   is based on a tax sharing policy. This tax sharing policy, which may be changed in future periods at the discretion of the board of directors of   Liberty Global  , generally results in the allocation of   Liberty Global   s tax attributes to the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   based on the tax attributes of the legal entities attributed to each of the groups. Nevertheless, to the extent that   Liberty Global   management concludes the actions or results of one group give rise to changes in the tax attributes of the other group, the change in those tax attributes are generally allocated to the group whose actions or results gave rise to such changes. Similarly, in cases where legal entities in one group join in a common tax filing with members of the other group, changes in the tax attributes of the group that includes the filing entity that are the result of the actions or financial results of one or more members of the other group are allocated to the group that does not include the filing entity. For periods beginning on and after July 1, 2015, we will record non-interest bearing inter-group payables and receivables in connection with the allocation of tax attributes. These inter-group payables and receivables are expected to be cash settled annually within 90 days following the filing of the relevant tax return to the extent that tax assets are utilized or taxable income is included in the return for the applicable taxable year. In the case of allocated tax assets, inter-group payables and receivables will only be recorded to the extent that the realization by the ultimate tax-paying entity is considered to be more-likely-than-not. At   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the tax assets of the   Dutch Fiscal Unity  . To the extent that tax assets are not utilized in the year generated, the related receivables and payables will remain outstanding until such time as the underlying tax assets are utilized.

Liberty Global Group    
  Income tax benefit (expense) attributable to our earnings (loss) before income taxes differs from the amounts computed using the applicable income tax rate as a result of the following factors: 

_______________ 
           (a) 
    The statutory or  expected  tax rate is the   U.K.   rate of   20.0%  . During 2015, the   U.K.   enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of   20.0%   to   19.0%   in April 2017 and   18.0%   in April 2020. Substantially all of the impact of these rate changes on our deferred tax balances was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the change in law was enacted. During the third quarter of 2016, the   U.K.   enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from 18.0% to 17.0%.

  Income tax expense attributable to our earnings (loss) before income taxes differs from the amounts computed using the applicable income tax rate as a result of the following: 

_______________ 
           (a) 
    The statutory or  expected  tax rate is the   U.K.   rate of   20.0%  . During 2015, the   U.K.   enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of   20.0%   to   19.0%   in April 2017 and   18.0%   in April 2020. Substantially all of the impact of these rate changes on our deferred tax balances was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 when the change in law was enacted. During the third quarter of 2016, the   U.K.   enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from 18.0% to 17.0%. The impact of this rate change on our deferred tax balances was recorded this quarter. 
              (b) 
    Amounts reflect adjustments (either an increase or a decrease) to  expected  tax benefit (expense) for statutory rates in jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the   U.K.

    Allocated Expenses 
     Prior to   July 1, 2015  , we did not allocate any of the costs of the   Liberty Global Group   s corporate functions to the   LiLAC Group  . Following the   July 1, 2015   distribution of the   LiLAC Shares  , we began to allocate a portion of these costs, excluding share-based compensation expense, to the   LiLAC Group   based primarily on the estimated percentage of time spent by corporate personnel providing services for each group. The allocated amount, which is cash settled and is periodically re-evaluated, is presented as inter-group fees and allocations in the attributed statement of operations information.  
  The share-based compensation expense reflected in the accompanying attributed statement of operations information is based on the share incentive awards held by the employees of the respective entities comprising the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group  . 
  The income tax benefit and expense of the   Liberty Global Group   and the   LiLAC Group   includes inter-group tax allocations. For additional information concerning our inter-group tax allocations, see note   2   to this attributed financial information. 
  While we believe that our allocation methodologies are reasonable, we may elect to change these allocation methodologies or the percentages used to allocate operating and SG A expenses in the future.

    Inter-group Transactions 
     Inter-group Interest 
  On May 16, 2016, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement and following shareholder approvals, we acquired   CWC   for shares of   Liberty Global  . Under the terms of the transaction,   CWC   shareholders received in the aggregate:   31,607,008   Class A   Liberty Global Shares  ,   77,379,774   Class C   Liberty Global Shares  ,   3,648,513   Class A   LiLAC Shares   and   8,939,316   Class C   LiLAC Shares  . Further, in accordance with the scheme of arrangement and immediately prior to the acquisition,   CWC   declared the Special Dividend to its shareholders in the amount of    0.03   (  $0.04   at the transaction date) per   CWC   share. The   Special Dividend   was paid to   CWC   shareholders promptly following the closing and the payment, together with fees and expenses related to the acquisition, was funded with   CWC   liquidity, including incremental debt borrowings, and   LiLAC Group   corporate liquidity.  
    
  Following completion of the   CWC Acquisition  , we attributed   CWC   to the   LiLAC Group  , with the   Liberty Global Group   being granted an inter-group interest in the   LiLAC Group   representing the fair value (as determined by our board of directors) of the   Liberty Global Shares   issued as part of the purchase consideration.   Liberty Global Group  's inter-group interest in the   LiLAC Group   was $3.9 billion as of June 30, 2016. During the period from May 16, 2016 through June 30, 2016, we recorded the   Liberty Global Group   s 67.5% share of the   LiLAC Group   s loss during this period in   Liberty Global Group   s attributed statement of operations information with a corresponding offsetting amount recorded in the   LiLAC Group   s attributed statement of operations information. On July 1, 2016, we completed the   LiLAC Distribution  , thereby eliminating the   Liberty Global Group  's inter-group interest in the   LiLAC Group  . The   LiLAC Distribution   was accounted for prospectively effective July 1, 2016.  
    
  Lila Chile Note    
  On July 11, 2014,   Lila Chile Holding   and Liberty Global Holding B.V. (  Liberty Global Holding  ), an entity attributed to the   Liberty Global Group  , entered into a loan agreement (the   Lila Chile Note  ). At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   Liberty Global Holding   owed   Lila Chile Holding     $8.3 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, in principal pursuant to the   Lila Chile Note  . The   Lila Chile Note   bears interest at 5.9% per annum and has a repayment date of July 11, 2022. The principal and accrued interest on the   Lila Chile Note   are included in the   LiLAC Group   s other assets, net, and the   Liberty Global Group   s long-term debt and capital lease obligations in the attributed balance sheet information. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally transferred to the principal balance on January 1 of each year. The net increase in the   Lila Chile Note   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes (i) cash loans of   $6.8 million   and (ii) the transfer of   $0.4 million   in non-cash accrued interest to the principal balance.
