     Table of Contents          NHALE, INC.     Notes to Financial Statements     (Unaudited)    Note 1. Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Nhale, Inc. ( NHLE  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 13, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for our interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, as reported in our annual report on Form 10-K, have been omitted.     Nhale, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on March 8, 2012 as Gankit Corporation, an e-commerce website selling a multitude of consumer products including electronics, appliances, clothing, accessories, sporting goods and gift cards.     On May 12, 2014, Riverview Heights, LLC (the  Majority Shareholder ) purchased 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the 30,000,000 total issued and outstanding shares representing 66.67% of the total equity of the Company. On May 13, 2014, John Arnold resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Sole Director and the majority shareholder appointed Lance Williams as Sole Director, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company.     The Company then ceased to operate its e-commerce website and abandoned that business model, and re-focused on the development, branding and distribution of non-flame smoking devices.      Note 2. Going Concern      The Company has an accumulated deficit of $1,667,052 and has recurring negative cash flows from operations. As a result, the Company does not have the resources at this time to repay its credit and debt obligations, make any payments in the form of dividends to its shareholders or fully implement its business plan. Without additional capital, the Company will not be able to remain in business.     These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.      In addition to operational expenses, as the Company executes its business plan, it is incurring expenses related to complying with its public reporting requirements. In order to finance these expenditures, the Company has raised capital in the form of debt, which will have to be repaid, as discussed in detail below. The Company has depended on loans from private investors and outside investors for most of its operating capital. The Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve months in order to remain in business.     Management anticipates that significant dilution will occur as a result of any future sales of the Company s common stock and this will reduce the value of its outstanding shares. The Company cannot project the future level of dilution that will be experienced by investors as a result of its future financings, but it will significantly affect the value of its shares.     The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.               7       
     Table of Contents          Note 3. Notes Payable      During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we borrowed an additional $80,000, issuing three promissory notes with issue dates, maturity dates, nominal amounts and interest rates as follows:           During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we accrued $49,875 of interest on our promissory notes collectively.      Also during the three months ended August 31, 2016, we reclassified one promissory note with a nominal value of $15,000, from long-term to short-term as their maturity dates fell to within twelve months. Additionally, we reclassified two promissory notes with an aggregate nominal value of $125,000 from short-term to Notes Payable in Default as their maturity dates expired without extension. The terms of these notes are that, upon default, a higher interest rate is applied to the outstanding unpaid principal.      Our weighted average annual interest rates at August 31, 2016 are: for Notes Payable in Default   24%, Short-Term Notes   15%, Long-Term Notes - $15%.               8       
     Table of Contents           ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        The following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with the Company s financial statements and related notes thereto, as included in this report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, filed October 13, 2016.       Organization and Basis of Presentation      Nhale Inc. ( NHLE  or the  Company ) was incorporated as GankIt Corporation in the state of Nevada on March 8, 2012, with a fiscal year end of May 31. Until May 12, 2014, we were an e-commerce business focused on selling a diverse set of products through a website that could either be won through a bidding process or purchased at a discount to the suggested retail price.     On May 12, 2014, Riverview Heights, LLC purchased 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the 30,000,000 total issued and outstanding shares common stock of Company, thus becoming the Majority Shareholder (hereafter the  Majority Shareholder ). The Majority Shareholder purchased 12,500,000 shares of common stock from Clark Rohde and 7,500,000 shares of common stock from John Arnold.     On May 13, 2014 the Majority Shareholder appointed Lance Williams as Sole Director, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company; and concurrently therewith accepted the resignation of John Arnold from his positions of Sole Director, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. Concurrently the Company filed with the State of Nevada to change its name to Nhale, Inc. to better reflect its revised business model.     We have refocused the business plan to production of herbal vaporizer pens and other legal products in the consumer space focusing on the decriminalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes, a significant trend occurring in the U.S. and around the world.      Plan of Operations      Our plan of operation revolves around the development and commercialization of technologies related to the medical marijuana market. As more states legalize medical marijuana there will be increasing opportunities for us to commercialize new technologies designed to for this sector. The first product we have commercialized is the Nhale.     The Nhale is a herbal vaporizer pen in a convenient multi-use kit. The multi-purpose kit includes everything needed for vaporizing dry leaf herbs, waxes, oils and e-liquids.     The company began development of the Nhale brand in June 2014, obtaining the product through and outsourced manufacturer selected and engaged by the Company.       Results of Operations      We have not generated any revenues from operations and we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of an early stage business enterprise, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business strategies (See "Risk Factors", below). To become profitable and competitive over the long run, we must develop our business and marketing plan and execute it.               9       
     Table of Contents          Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 versus 2015       Sales and marketing      Our sales and marketing expenses were zero for the three months ended August 31, 2016 versus $1,050 for the same period in 2015. The Company has not been marketing its products actively.      General and administrative expenses      Our general and administrative costs were down $52,197 ($50,301 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 versus $102,498 in 2015). This reduction was the net of the change in consulting expenses (a reduction of $75,000), the change in compliance costs (an increase of $21,611) and an increase in office costs and travel (an increase of $1,192).       Interest expense      Interest expense went from $38,438 for the three months ended August 31, 2015 to $49,875 for the same period in 2016, owing to higher debt levels. Additionally, as explained in Note 3 to the financial statements, we carry a higher weighted average interest rate for debt which is in default at the balance sheet date. The amount of debt in default has increased.      Forgiveness of debt      We recorded forgiveness of debt income of $140,376 during the three months ended August 31, 2015 when we signed an agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer, John Arnold, to settle our obligation to him. We had no such forgiveness of debt income in the current year.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      As of August 31, 2016, the Company had current assets of $19,347, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $16,689 and other current assets of $2,658.      We had negative working capital of $1,403,802 and a deficit accumulated of $1,667,052 as of August 31, 2016.      Cash Flows from Operating Activities      During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company used cash in operating activities of $63,336 and $14,747, respectively. The majority of this difference arises from differences in the net loss for those two periods.      Cash Flows from Investing Activities      There were no cash flows provided or used in investing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2016 nor 2015.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities      During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we received $80,000 in proceeds from three promissory notes. During the same period in 2015, we had $15,000 of such proceeds.          Capital Requirements      If we do not raise any additional capital we will not be able to implement any facets of our business plan.     We intend to pursue capital through public or private financing as well as borrowings and other sources, such as our equity backed loans in order to finance our business activities. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then our ability to continue our operations may be significantly hindered.     We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of an early stage business enterprise, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business strategies (See "Risk Factors", above). To become profitable and competitive over the long run, we must develop our business and marketing plan and execute such plan. Our management will attempt to secure financing through various means including borrowing and investment from institutions and private individuals.     Our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. See Note 2 of our financial statements.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Our principal executive officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a   15(e) and 15d   15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SEC s rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to a lack of segregation of duties and an absence of written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.      Change in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       From time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently involved in legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Commission on October 13, 2016, and investors are encouraged to review such risk factors prior to making an investment in the Company.       ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended August 31, 2016.       ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES       None.       ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES       Not applicable.       ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION       Not applicable.           ITEM 6.

I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and have:                                a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;                         b)  Paragraph omitted in accordance with SEC transition instructions contained in SEC Release No. 33-8238, and an extension of the compliance date in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8545 and Release No. 33-8618;                         c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and                         d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.                                5.  I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s auditors and the audit committee of Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):                             a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and                         b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
