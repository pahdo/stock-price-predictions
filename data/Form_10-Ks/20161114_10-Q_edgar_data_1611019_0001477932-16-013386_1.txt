     Table of Contents           CALEMINDER, INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)       NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS       Caleminder, Inc. ( the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on May 28, 2014. The Company has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations.     The Company s principal operations will include an online reminder service. The Company plans to generate revenues through online advertising.      The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company s business plan.       NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES          Basis of Accounting       The Company s condensed financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end.     In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Caleminder Inc. contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.       Income Taxes       A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.     When required, the Company records a liability for unrecognized tax positions, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability.      The Company recognizes penalties and interest associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in the balance sheet. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest as of September 30, 2016.                 F-5       
     Table of Contents           Loss per Share       The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. The Company has not issued any potentially dilutive debt or equity securities.       Recently issued accounting pronouncements       The Company does not believe that there are any new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.       NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES       The Company uses the liability method , where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. As of September 30, 2016 the cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $86,000 and will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred.        NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT         Authorized       The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock. All common shares have equal voting rights, are non-assessable and have one vote per share. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they choose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company.       Issued and Outstanding       On June 1, 2014, the Company issued 7,500,000 common shares to its sole stockholder for cash consideration of $0.0001 per share. The proceeds of $750 were received on June 27, 2014.     On February 9, 2015, the Company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock for $50,000 as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC, at an offering price of $0.02 per share.        NOTE 5. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST       The officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.       NOTE 6. GOING CONCERN       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has no revenues, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $86,000. This condition among others raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Management is planning to raise funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.       NOTE 7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans from the Company s sole stockholder amounted to $27,934 and $11,664, respectively, and represent working capital advances. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.                 F-6

As used in this Form 10-Q, references to   Caleminder , the   Company,     we,     our   or   us   refer to Caleminder Inc , unless the context otherwise indicates.       Forward-Looking Statements       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q (the  Report ). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.       Corporate Background and Business Overview        We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 28, 2014 and are a development stage company. Our company has developed an online service www.caleminder.net that provides a calendar- based greeting and reminder service to assist subscribers in remembering important life events such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc.     Users register with the system and enter these important dates as well as configure a variety of settings, including when they want to be notified, for example one month prior, two weeks prior, one week prior, etc. Currently the application is web based and not for a mobile download application.       Employees       Other than our current director and officer, we have no employees at September 30, 2016 .       Transfer Agent       We have engaged Vstock Transfer LLC, 77 Spruce Street, Suite 201, Cedarhurst, NY, 11516 as our stock transfer agent. Their telephone number is (212) 828-8436 and their fax number is (646) 536-3179. The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock.      Results of Operations         Comparison for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015         Revenues      During the three months period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue.      Operating Expenses       The Company s operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,670 and $7,394 for the three month ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses primarily consisted of professional and consulting fees. The reduction of operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to a reduction in consulting fees.     Net Loss     During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized net losses of $4,670 and $7,394, respectively.                  3       
     Table of Contents            Comparison for the nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015         Revenues      During the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue.      Operating Expenses       The Company s operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $19,593 and $40,759 for the nine month ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses primarily consisted of professional and consulting fees. The reduction of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to a reduction in consulting fees.     Net Loss     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized net losses of $19,593 and $40,759, respectively.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Our cash balance as of September 30, 2016 was $1,994.      Historically, we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loans from a related party. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $16,270 and $36,534, respectively.     We have not generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing, and generate revenue. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We will require additional funds to maintain our reporting status with the SEC.       Going Concern Consideration       We have incurred net losses since our inception through September 30, 2016 totaling $85,836 and have completed only the preliminary stages of our business plan. We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. Accordingly, our independent auditors  report on our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.                  4       
     Table of Contents           Item 4. Controls and Procedures         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As a result of this evaluation, management identified the following deficiencies, which are deemed to be material weaknesses:                       Due to the size of the Company, there is a lack of segregation of duties, which would allow for proper processing, review and approval of transactions and events that have an impact on the Company s financial results.                        The Company lacks a system to allow for the review and monitoring of internal control over financial reporting, which would mitigate concerns related to management s override of controls.                        The Company lacks an independent Audit Committee, which can provide oversight of management and the financial reporting process.            Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting for the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.                   5
