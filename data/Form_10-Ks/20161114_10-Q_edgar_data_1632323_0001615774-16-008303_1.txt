CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Report )
contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
 Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).
Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking
statements may include words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   intend, 
 could,   should,   would,   may,   seek,   plan,   might, 
 will,   expect,   predict,   project,   forecast,   potential, 
 continue  negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are
made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance
or achievement to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. 

We cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties.
Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described in such statements
or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any
of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this Report and include
information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, including statements about potential acquisition or
merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements
regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations, business plans and future financial results, and any other
statements that are not historical facts. 

These forward-looking statements represent
our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described
in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Report and attributable to
us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred
to in this Report. 

Except to the extent required by law, we undertake

BANG HOLDINGS CORP.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS
AND GOING CONCERN  

(A) Organization   

Bang Holdings Corp. was
incorporated in the State of Colorado on May 13, 2014. The Company was organized to develop and sell E-Cigarette products. 

Bang Vapor, Inc. was incorporated
in the State of Florida on October 27, 2014. The Company was organized to develop and sell E-Cigarette products. 

Bang Digital Media, Inc.
was incorporated in the State of Florida on November 23, 2015. The Company was organized to develop digital and electronic media. 

(B) Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States for interim information Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments consisting of a normal and recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and for
the year then ended, which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on Form 10-K on April 14,
2016. 

(C) Principles of Consolidation   

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bang Holdings Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Bang Vapor, Inc.
(from October 27, 2014) and Bang Digital Media, Inc. (from November 23, 2015) and are hereafter referred to as (the  Company ).
All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation. 

(D) Going Concern   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net operating losses and used cash
in operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,208,873 and used cash in operations of $355,831.
The company is also in default on the repayment of its convertible note payable of $500,000. Losses have principally occurred as
a result of the substantial resources required for marketing of the Company s products which included the general and administrative
expenses associated with its organization and product development. 

These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management believes that the actions
presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the Company to
continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

(A) Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all
highly liquid temporary cash instruments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

8   

(B) Use of Estimates in Financial Statements   

The presentation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the period covered
by these financial statements include the valuation of website costs, valuation of deferred tax asset, stock based compensation
and beneficial conversion features on convertible debt. 

(C) Fair value measurements and Fair
value of Financial Instruments   

The Company adopted FASB
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring
fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date. 

Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities
in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data. 

Level 3-Inputs are unobservable
inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability based on the best available information. 

The Company did not identify
any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820. 

Due to the short-term nature
of all financial assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet dates. 

(D) Computer and Equipment and Website
Costs   

Computer Equipment and
Website Costs are capitalized at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated by using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five years for all categories. Repairs and maintenance are charged
to expense as incurred. Expenditures for betterments and renewals are capitalized. The cost of computer equipment and the related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts upon retirement or disposal with any resulting gain or loss being recorded
in operations. 

Software maintenance costs
are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for enhanced functionality are capitalized. 

The Company has adopted
the provisions of ASC 350-50-15,  Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.  Costs inured in the planning stage of
a website are expensed as research and development while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized
over the life of the asset, estimated to be three years.

     Website costs    
     3 Years  

9   

Computer and equipment
and website costs consisted of the following: 

Depreciation expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,027 and $906, respectively. 

(E) Inventories   

The Company s inventories
consist entirely of purchased finished goods. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in,
first-out basis. 

(F) Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes
revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic. 605  Revenue Recognition . In all cases, revenue is
recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed
and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped
to the customers and collectability is reasonable assured. 

The Company recognizes
revenue from advertising transactions when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price
is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 

(G) Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Costs   

Advertising, marketing
and promotion expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying
statement of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, advertising, marketing and promotion expense was
$32,971 and $38,677, respectively. 

(H) Segments   

The Company operates in
one segment and therefore segment information is not presented. 

(I) Loss Per Share   

The basic loss per share
is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares during the period. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss by the diluted weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic
weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. The Company had 969,277 shares issuable upon the
exercise of options and warrants and 1,468,571 shares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes payable that were not included
in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive for nine months ended September 30, 2016.
The Company had 1,514,286 shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants and 1,428,571 shares issuable upon conversion
of convertible notes payable that were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive
for nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

10   

(J) Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company recognizes
compensation costs to employees under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. Under FASB ASC Topic. 718,
companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair
value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services.
Share based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation
rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such
compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. 

Equity instruments issued
to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity
Based Payments to Non-Employees. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached
or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related
to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification. 

(K) Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for
income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

(L ) Shipping and Handling Costs  

The Company includes shipping
and handling fees billed to customers as revenue and shipping and handling costs to customers as cost of revenue. 

(M) Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued
a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S.
GAAP. The standard s core principle (issued as ASU 2014-09 by the FASB), is that a company will recognize revenue when it
transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating
the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate
performance obligation. The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in
the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the
original effective date. This ASU is effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating its adoption method and the impact of the standard on its condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability,
which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use
asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease
term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were
made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently reviewing
the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (topic 718). The FASB issued this update to improve the
accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.
Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences;
(b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The updated
guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard. 

In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016 10  Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.
 The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this
Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance,
while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers
to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license
provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time)
or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are
intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply
with Topic 606. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

Recent accounting pronouncements
issued by FASB (including the Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC, did not or are not believed by the Company management,
to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.

NOTE 3   PREPAID EXPENSES  

On November 12, 2015, the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $50,000 for
a consulting agreement expiring on February 1, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $19,753.
The balance in prepaid expenses related to the above common stock issuance was $0 as of September 30, 2016 and $19,753 as of December
31, 2015. 

NOTE 4   LOAN PAYABLE  

The Company entered in
an agreement with a third party for a loan for gross proceeds of $6,500. The loan is non-interest bearing and matures in April
2017. 

NOTE 5   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  

On July 25, 2016, the Company
entered into an agreement for the issuance of a convertible note to a third party lender for $50,000. The note accrues interest
at 10% per annum maturing on July 25, 2017 and is convertible into common stock at the discretion of the holder at a conversion
price of $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment. 

On July 29, 2016, the Company
entered in an agreement with a third party for a convertible promissory note for gross proceeds of $10,000. The note bears interest
at 10% per annum, is due on July 29, 2017 and is convertible into common stock at the discretion of the holder at a conversion
price of $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment. 

NOTE 6   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE   RELATED PARTIES  

On August 22, 2014 the
Company entered into an agreement to issue an unsecured convertible promissory note for $500,000 and security purchase agreement
for 1,000,000 shares of common stock for $350,000 ($0.35 per share), respectively with a related party. The note bears interest
at an annual rate of 10% and is payable on or before 12 months from the date of issuance. The Company issued the holder a total
of 1,500,000 warrants exercisable at a cashless conversion price of $0.35 for a period of 5 years. The warrants were valued using
the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 0%, annual volatility of 353%, risk free
interest rate of 1.68%, and expected life of 5 years for a fair value of $524,960. The Company allocated $190,900 for the fair
value of the convertible note payable. In addition, the note may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares
of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.35 per share, subject to adjustment. The Company recorded a debt
discount of $190,900 for the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature and $190,900 for the value of the warrants received.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company amortized $381,800 and accrued interest of $107,630 and $68,082, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the convertible note payable was in default. 

On January 29, 2016, the
Company s President loaned the Company $30,000 pursuant to a convertible debenture. The Loan bears interest at 10% per annum,
is due on January 29, 2017 and is convertible into common stock at the discretion of the holder at a conversion price of $2.00
per share, subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the note agreement, for a period of one year following the Initial Closing Date,
the Company shall agree to or not issue any Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock
(or modify any of the foregoing which may be outstanding) to any person or entity at a price per share or conversion or exercise
price per share which shall be less than the conversion price in effect at such time without the consent of the purchaser, then
the conversion price shall be reduced to such lower price. Under ASC 815-40-15, the Company is required to account for convertible
debt with reset provisions when the following three items are present (1) one or more underlying amounts or payments are required
(2) no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts
(3) its terms require or permit net settlement, it can be readily settled net by means outside the contract or it provides for
delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from the net settlement. ASC 815-40-15 further
defines the requirement that the assets are readily convertible to cash. Due to the lack of a public market for the Company s
securities, the Company determined that the convertible notes payable were not readily convertible to cash and therefore no derivative
liability has been recorded. 

In addition, the Company
agreed to issue 30,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.50 per share that expire on January 29, 2021. The Company recorded
a debt discount of $10,500 for the value of the warrants received. As of September 30, 2016, the Company amortized $10,500 and accrued
interest of $1,887, respectively and fully paid off the note.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion and analysis of
the results of operations and financial condition of Bang Holdings Corp. (the  Company ,  we ,  us 
or  our ) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of Bang Holdings Corp. and the notes to those
financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon
current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results
and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number
of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors and Business sections in the financial statements and footnotes included
in the Company s Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Words such as  anticipate, 
 estimate,   plan,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect, 
 believe,   intend,   may,   will,   should,   could, 
and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements.  

Bang Holdings Corp. was incorporated in the
state of Colorado on May 13, 2014. It is a brand management and digital advertising company that provides content and an influencer-based
marketing network to the cannabis industry. We are a development-stage company and since our inception we have generated only minimal
revenues from business operations. 

Our independent registered public accounting
firm has issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless
we obtain additional capital to pay our ongoing operational costs. Accordingly, we must locate sources of capital to pay our operational
costs. 

Our operational expenditures are primarily
related to development of Bang s multi-channel advertising network, marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining
users, and the costs related to being a fully reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

During fiscal year 2015, we quintupled the direct reach of our 4TwentyToday network of channels over the
course of the year to around 500,000 users and expanded the reach of our social influencer network to more than 11 million. Further,
in the first nine months of 2016, we have grown our user base to nearly one million subscribers.   At
five persons, our core team has remained small and highly efficient, and has built a firm foundation for growth in the quarters
and years to come. 

Business Overview  

Bang Holdings Corp wholly owns two subsidiaries,
Bang Digital Media, a cannabis focused digital media company, and Bang Vapor, an e-juice company that can crossover to the cannabis
market. 

On May 9, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) announced the issuance of a final rule (the  Rule ) deeming all tobacco products, including  electronic
cigarettes  and their components and parts, subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD C Act), as amended
by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act). As a result of the new Rule, all electronic cigarette
products will be subject to the same FD C Act provisions and relevant regulatory requirements to which cigarettes are subject.
Due to this increased regulatory scrutiny, the Company has shifted its focus to concentrate primarily on the cannabis focused media
segment of its operations. 

Bang Digital Media is the hub for all  cannabusiness 
related advertising, content creation, technology and marketing. It consists of two divisions, the multi-platform 4TTnetwork, and
a network of social media influencers that we call the Green Monkey Network. 

The 4TTnetwork is comprised primarily of specifically
targeted audiences. These are 4TwentyToday, VaporBang, and 4TT/V which cross the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Massroots,
Instagram and YouTube. 

16   

4TwentyToday is a digital, multi-platform channel
that enables us to target advertising for Bang Holdings products and services across social media platforms. We currently have
in excess of one million users of our network, with a steady growth rate of around two percent per week. By continuing to create
targeted, quality content for this community on a daily basis 4TwentyToday has, for example, created one of the most actively engaged
marijuana pages on Facebook. This has built high levels of trust and goodwill in the community, which will be convertible to revenues
once we have reached a critical mass of users. 

Using the same skillset, we are developing
VaporBang   a digital, multi-platform community for vaping enthusiasts. At more than 86,000 strong, ours is the largest vaping
community on Facebook. 

Our most successful post on Facebook in 2015
had 5.4 million views, leading to 309,000  reactions,  95,000  shares,  and 92,000  comments. 
The post was created to build upon our social media footprint related to our business, not specifically towards our products. 

The  Green Monkey Network  is a
network of social media influencers who are open to working as ambassadors in the marijuana industry. These influencers expanded
the Bang network by more than 10 million users. 

Ultimately, the key performance indicator ( KPI )
of Bang Digital Media is in the direct and expanded growth of our networks. By continuing to grow 4TwentyToday and the  Green
Monkey Network  to 100 million users we will have the digital reach to propel marijuana-friendly brands into the spotlight. 

Plan of Operations  

Bang will continue to 
 build partnerships with influential social media personalities and celebrities in several key genres to serve as brand ambassadors
for our clients. By continuing to give a unique platform to YouTubers and Vine stars to monetize their social media followings,
Bang will be able to build brand awareness and employ an army of influencers to sell and promote product . 
Compensation to social media personalities and celebrities will be bonus incentivized along with a commission structure.  Therefore,
we anticipate no up-front expenditures. 

Results of Operations  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for three
months ended September 30, 2015        

Revenue  

We generated no revenue for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $576 for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

We incurred operating expenses of $242,966 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $188,328 for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $54,638. The increase in operating expenses is primarily
attributable to an increase of $35,661 in professional fees and an increase of $15,664 in sales and marketing expenses. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $20,464 in relation to the convertible notes and accretion of debt discount. During the three months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company recorded interest expenses of $67,015.  

Net Loss  

We had a net loss of $263,430 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $255,016
for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $8,414. The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to the
significant increases in operating expenses partially offset by a decrease in interest expense. 

17   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for nine
months ended September 30, 2015        

Revenue  

We have generated $123 in revenue for the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $576 for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

We incurred operating expenses of $699,802 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $845,279 for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $145,477. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily
attributable to a decrease of $174,187 in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset
by an increase in professional fees of $11,150 and an increase in sales and marketing expenses of $17,560 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $51,052 in relation to the convertible notes and accretion of debt discount. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company recorded interest expenses of $281,141.  

Net Loss  

We had a net loss of $750,836 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,126,093
for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $375,257. The decrease in net loss is primarily due to the significant
decreases in operating expenses and interest expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. We have
been funding our operations through the sale of our common stock and loans. 

Our primary uses of cash have been for payroll
and operating expenses. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity in the near
term: 

18   

Development of a Company
website  

Exploration of potential
marketing and advertising opportunities, and  

The cost of being a public
company  

Our net revenues are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. At September 30, 2016, we had
a cash balance of $247,939. From January 1, 2016 through the date of this filing, we raised $85,000 from the sale of convertible
debentures to independent third party investors, $30,000 from the sale of convertible debentures to the Company s president,
$319,956 from the sale of common stock through private placements, $14,000 in advances from related parties and $210,000 from the
exercise of warrants to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. In addition the Company paid related
party convertible notes in the amount of $30,000 and related party advances in the amount of $7,500. 

We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We estimate that based on current
plans and assumptions, our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations
without further financing. Other than working capital, we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We may
need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company.  Therefore,
our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing.  Financing transactions may include
the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading price
of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through
the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur
unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force
us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional
dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common
stock. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans
and possibly cease our operations. 

We anticipate that depending on market conditions
and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

19   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Working Capital  

The following table summarizes total current
assets, liabilities and working capital at September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015: 

At September 30, 2016, we had a working
capital deficit of $1,022,741, as compared to working capital deficit of $915,448 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $107,293. 

Net Cash Used In Operating Activities  

Net cash used in operating activities
of $355,831 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable and accrued
expenses of $253,742 and loss from operations adjusted by non-cash items totaling $141,790. 

Net Cash Used In Investing Activities  

There was no cash used in investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $31,975 used for the purchase of fixed assets during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities of $586,506 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted
primarily of proceeds from convertible notes of $60,000, proceeds from related party convertible notes of $30,000, proceeds from
exercise of warrants of $210,000 and proceeds from the private placement of securities of $310,006. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company received proceeds from the private placement of securities of $66,350 and proceeds from exercise
of warrants of $100,000. 

20   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016 we had no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Use of Estimates in Financial Statements   

The presentation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the period covered by these financial statements include the valuation
of website costs, valuation of deferred tax asset, stock based compensation and any beneficial conversion features on convertible
debt. 

Fair value measurements and Fair value of Financial Instruments   

The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair
Value Measurements . ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and
establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date. 

Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable
market data. 

Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which
reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability based on the best available information. 

The Company did not identify any assets or
liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820. 

Due to the short-term nature of all financial
assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet date.      

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements
in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition . In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price
is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped to the customers and collectability
is reasonable assured. 

The Company recognizes revenue from advertising
transactions when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable
and collectability is reasonably assured.  

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company recognizes compensation costs to
employees under FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.  Under FASB ASC Topic. 718, companies
are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and
recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share
based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation rights
and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation
amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. 

21   

Equity instruments issued to other than employees
are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB ASC Topic 505,  Equity Based Payments to
Non-Employees . In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b)
the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the
instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive
new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard s
core principle (issued as ASU 2014-09 by the FASB), is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption
or a modified retrospective approach. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09
by one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. This
ASU is effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is
currently evaluating its adoption method and the impact of the standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is
an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02
does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align,
where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation  (topic 718). The FASB issued this update to improve the accounting for employee
share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the
update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10
 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The amendments in this
Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following
two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related
principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services
in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with
either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the
entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed
implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company
is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition. 

Recent accounting pronouncements issued by
FASB (including the Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC, did not or are not believed by the Company management,
to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements. 

ITEM 3   
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

We do not hold any derivative instruments and
do not engage in any hedging activities. 

ITEM 4   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

We carried out an evaluation required by Rule
13a-15 of the Exchange Act under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s  disclosure
controls and procedures  and  internal control over financial reporting  as of the end of the period covered
by this Report. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange
Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Board and the
Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

22   

The matters involving internal controls and
procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting
in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives; (4) lack of expertise with complex GAAP and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
reporting matters and (5) management is dominated by one individual without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned
material weaknesses were identified by our Principal Executive and Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial
statements as of September 30, 2016. At this time, management has decided that given the risks associated with this lack of segregation
of duties, the potential benefit of adding additional personnel to clearly segregate duties does not justify the expenses associated
with such benefit. Management will periodically review this matter and may make modifications, including adding additional personnel,
it determines appropriate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are currently not involved in any litigation
that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting
our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in
their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

ITEM I A - RISK FACTORS  

With the exception of the Risk Factor listed
below, there are no changes that constitute material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. 

The application of the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act to all tobacco products, including products like the Company s vaporizers, will have a material adverse
effect on our business.   

On May 9, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) announced the issuance of a final rule (the  Rule ) deeming all tobacco products, including  electronic
cigarettes  and their components and parts, subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD C Act), as amended
by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act). As a result of the new Rule, all electronic cigarette
products will be subject to the same FD C Act provisions and relevant regulatory requirements to which cigarettes are subject,
with respect to the following: 

1. Enforcement action against
products determined to be adulterated or misbranded (other than enforcement actions based on lack of a marketing authorization
during an applicable compliance period); 

2. Required submission
of ingredient listing and reporting of HPHCs; 

3. Required registration
of tobacco product manufacturing establishments and product listing; 

4. Prohibition against
sale and distribution of products with modified risk descriptors (e.g.,  light,   low,  and  mild 
descriptors) and claims unless FDA issues an order authorizing their marketing; 

5. Prohibition on the distribution
of free samples (same as cigarettes); 

6. Premarket review requirements; 

23   

7. Implementation of minimum
age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to individuals under age 18; 

8. Inclusion of a
health warning; and 

9. Prohibition of sale
of electronic cigarettes in vending machines, unless in a facility that never admits youth. 

The application of the Rule will result in
additional expenses, could affect the markets we sell our products in, could require us to change our advertising and labeling
and method of marketing our products, any of which would have a substantial adverse effect on our business, results of operation
and financial condition.  In addition, the application process of our products by the FDA could cost the Company several hundred
thousand dollars. 

We may face the same governmental actions
aimed at conventional cigarettes and other tobacco products.   

The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory
developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization s Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control, or the FCTC. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish
a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory
initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: 

the levying of substantial
and increasing tax and duty charges;  

restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;   

the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;   

restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;   

restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;   

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels;   

requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;   

increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;   

elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and   

encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.   

If vaporizers and/or electronic cigarettes
are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected.
