1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation   

A.   
       Description of business    

On
Track Innovations Ltd. (the  Company ) was founded in 1990, in Israel. The Company and its subsidiaries (together
the  Group ) are principally engaged in the field of design and development of cashless payment solutions. The Company s
shares are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market (formerly listed on the NASDAQ Global Market until April 13, 2016).  

B.   
       Interim Unaudited Financial Information    

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and therefore
should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
have been included. Operating results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates:   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management s best knowledge
of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates.  

C.   
       Divestiture of operations    

1.    In
                                         December 2013, the Company completed the sale of certain assets, subsidiaries and intellectual
                                         property ( IP ) relating to its Smart ID division to SuperCom Ltd. ( SuperCom ).
                                         Accordingly the results and the cash flows of these operations for all reporting periods
                                         are presented in the statements of operations and in the statements of cash flows, respectively,
                                         as discontinued operations separately from continuing operations. During the nine month
                                         period ended September 30 2016, and 2015, the Company recorded profit from contingent
                                         consideration that derived from the SmartID division divesture (see also Note 6).                                                                                                                                               

2.    On
                                         September 14, 2016, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and IP relating
                                         to its Parking segment (the  Parking Business ) to Atrinet Ltd for a non-material
                                         amount. Accordingly the results and the cash flows of these operations for all reporting
                                         periods are presented in the statements of operations and in the statements of cash flows,
                                         respectively, as discontinued operations separately from continuing operations (see also
                                         Note 6). All prior periods  information has been reclassified to conform with the
                                         current period s presentation.                                                                                                  

Prior
to the foregoing sale of assets and IP, the Company bought outthe minority interest in its subsidiaries that operated the Parking
Business in consideration of $69.

       Other expenses    

Other
operating expenses presented in the statement of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 consist of

Pina, Israel, to a third party for a consideration of NIS 7,000 and will lease back the portion of the building necessary for
its current operations. The leaseback period is two years and the annual rent is approximately $130. The Company has the right
to extend the lease by two additional one year periods on the same terms. On September 4, 2016, the sale of the building was completed.
As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a loss of $83 under other operating expenses presented in the statement of operations
for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Note
2   Significant Accounting Policies   

These
interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the same accounting policies as
those discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Additional
significant accounting policies   

In
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification (hereinafter  
 ASC ) Topic 260  Earnings per Share , including potential common shares in the denominator of a diluted
per-share computation for continuing operations always will result in an antidilutive per-share amount when an entity has a loss
from continuing operations or a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders (that is, after any preferred
dividend deductions). Although including those potential common shares in the other diluted per-share computations may be dilutive
to their comparable basic per-share amounts, no potential common shares shall be included in the computation of any diluted per-share
amount when a loss from continuing operations exists, even if the entity reports net income.

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

1    On
                                         March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,
                                          Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
                                         Payment Accounting . This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for
                                         employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes,
                                         forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in
                                         the statement of cash flows. The ASU, among others, allows an entity to elect as an accounting
                                         policy either to continue to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite
                                         service period will not be rendered (as currently required) or to account for forfeitures
                                         when they occur. This entity-wide accounting policy election only applies to service
                                         conditions. For performance conditions, the entity continues to assess the probability
                                         that such conditions will be achieved. An entity must also disclose its policy election
                                         for forfeitures. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
                                         after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods,
                                         with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-09
                                         will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company
                                         has not yet selected an accounting policy for forfeitures under this new ASU.

                                         connection with other recent accounting pronouncements and the Company s assessment

                                         Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

A.      Legal
                                         claims     

1.    In
                                         June 2013, prior to the Company's divestiture of its SmartID division, Merwell Inc. ( Merwell )
                                         filed a claim against the Company before an agreed-upon arbitrator alleging breach of
                                         contract in connection with certain commissions claimed to be owed to Merwell with respect
                                         to the division s activities in Tanzania.  These activities, along with
                                         all other activities of the SmartID division, were later assigned to and assumed by SuperCom
                                         in its purchase of the division. SuperCom undertook to indemnify the Company and hold
                                         it harmless against any liabilities the Company may incur in connection with Merwell s
                                         consulting agreement and the arbitration.  An arbitration decision was issued on
                                         February 21, 2016, awarding Merwell approximately $855 for outstanding commissions, subject
                                         to further evaluation. The arbitration decision is being appealed and is thus not
                                         yet ripe for enforcement. Regardless, as mentioned above, SuperCom is liable for all
                                         costs and liabilities arising out of this claim. Therefore, the financial statements
                                         do not include any provision for this claim.    

2.    On
                                         October 3, 2013, a financial claim was filed against the Company and its then French
                                         subsidiary, Parx France (in this paragraph, together, the  Defendants ),
                                         in the Commercial Court of Paris, France (in this paragraph, the  Court ).
                                         The sum of the claim is Euro 1,500 (approximately $1,671), and is based on the allegation
                                         that the plaintiff sustained certain losses in connection with Defendants not granting
                                         the plaintiff exclusive marketing rights to distribute and operate the Defendants 
                                         PIAF Parking System in Paris and the Ile of France.                                                                                                                 

The
Company filed an initial memorandum of defense rejecting the plaintiff s allegations and claims. A technical hearing regarding
this matter is scheduled for November 26, 2016. Based on the advice of counsel, the Company currently believes that it has no
material obligations to the plaintiff and that there is no need for a provision for the claim.

7 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company's financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, short-term interest bearing investments, accounts
receivable, restricted deposits for employee benefits, accounts payable and short-term and long-term loans.  

Fair
value for the measurement of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value
is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability. The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs for fair value measurement. This hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:  

Level 1
                                         Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
                                         accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.                                                                                                                         

Level 2
                                         Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable
                                         for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full
                                         term of the asset or liability.                                                                                             

Level 3
                                         Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to
                                         the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations
                                         in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement
                                         date.    

By
distinguishing between inputs that are observable in the market place, and therefore more objective, and those that are unobservable
and therefore more subjective, the hierarchy is designed to indicate the relative reliability of the fair value measurements.
A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.  

The
Company, in estimating fair value for financial instruments, used the following methods and assumptions:  

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term interest bearing investments, trade receivables, short-term bank credit
and trade payables are equivalent to, or approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.  

The
carrying amounts of variable interest rate long-term loans are equivalent or approximate to their fair value as they bear interest
at approximate market rates. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of bank loans with fixed interest rates did not differ materially
from the carrying amount.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company held approximately $5,984 of short-term bank deposits (as of December 31, 2015, $5,454). Short-term
deposits in the amount of $1,548 have been pledged as security in respect of guarantees granted in respect of performance guarantees,
loans and credit lines received from a bank (as of December 31, 2015, $2,254) and cannot be pledged to others or withdrawn without
the consent of the bank.

                                         option plans     

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, 270,000 and 135,000 options were granted, respectively. The vesting
period for the options ranges from one year to four years. The exercise prices for the options range from $0.44 to $1.68. Those
options expire up to five years after the date of the grant. Any options which are forfeited or cancelled before expiration become
available for future grants under the Company s option plan.  

The
fair value of each option granted to employees and non-employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, for which the exercise price was greater than par value, was estimated on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes
model and the following assumptions:  

1.    Dividend
                                         yield of zero percent for all periods.   

2.    Risk-free
                                         interest rate of 1.03% and 1.21% for grants during the nine months ended September 30,
                                         2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, based on U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
                                         at the time of grant.   

3.    Estimated
                                         expected lives of 3.56 and 3.5 years for grants during the nine months ended September
                                         30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, using the simplified method.   

4.    Expected
                                         average volatility of 72% and 69% for grants during the nine months ended September 30,

9 - Operating segments    

For
the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance in order to improve profitability, the Company's chief operating
decision maker ( CODM ) examines two segments which are the Company's strategic business units: (1) Retail and Mass
Transit Ticketing; and (2) Petroleum. In addition to its two reportable segments, certain products for the medical industry and
other secure smart card solutions are classified under the Company s  Other  segment. Prior to its divestiture
of the Parking Business as noted in Notes 1C and 6 above, the CODM examined a third reportable segment consisting of the Company s
Parking acitivites. In light of the aforementioned divestiture, the previously reported parking segment has been eliminated with
the corresponding expenses and revenues reported as Discontinued Operations.  

The
strategic business unit's allocation of resources and evaluation of performance are managed separately. The CODM does not examine
assets or liabilities for those segments and therefore they are not presented.  

Information
regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below based on the internal management reports that are reviewed
by the CODM.

Overview  

We are a pioneer and leading
developer of cutting-edge secure cashless payment solutions, providing global enterprises with innovative technology for over two
decades. We currently operate in two main segments: (i) Petroleum and (2) Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing (following the divesture
of our Parking Business, see below). In addition to our two reportable segments, products of our MediSmart solutions and other
secure smart card solutions are classified under  Other  in segment analyses appearing in this Quarterly Report. 

Our field-proven suite
of cashless payment solutions is based on an extensive IP portfolio, including registered patents and patent applications worldwide.
Since our incorporation in 1990, we have built an international reputation for reliability and innovation, deploying hundreds of
solutions for banking, mobile network operators, vending, mass transit and petroleum. 

We operate a global network
of regional offices, distributors and partners to support various solutions deployed across the globe. 

We focus our efforts on
our core business of providing innovative cashless payment solutions based among other things on our contactless NFC technology.
We have increased our efforts to further develop existing and new products and solutions, including among others by the introduction
of our new telemetry and Internet of Things, or IoT, technology, and increased our sales and marketing activities and taskforce.
We also focus on developing strategic channel partnerships around the globe to increase our revenues and on maximizing the value
of our IP through licensing, customized technology solutions, strategic partnerships and enforcing our patent portfolio. Recently,
we have significantly cut costs and reduced operating expenses, in part by outsourcing part of our manufacturing activities. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   THREE MONTHS

TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

This discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained
in  Item 1.    Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report.   

Results of Operations  

Discontinued
operations . In December 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets, certain subsidiaries and IP directly related to our
SmartID division. On September 14, 2016, we closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Atrinet Ltd. and certain subsidiaries thereof,
or collectively, Atrinet, pursuant to which we sold to Atrinet our former parking business, including ongoing operations, transfer
of related employees, as well as IP directly related thereto, for a non-material amount. The results from such operations and the
cash flows for the reporting periods are presented in the statements of operations and in the statements of cash flows, respectively,
as discontinued operations separately from continuing operations. All the data in this Quarterly Report that are derived from our
financial statements, unless otherwise specified, exclude the results of those discontinued operations . 

Three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015  

Sources of Revenue  

We have historically derived
a substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of our products, including both complete systems and original equipment manufacturer
components. In addition, we generate revenues from licensing and transaction fees, and also, less significantly, from engineering
services, customer services and technical support. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the
revenues that we derived from sales and licensing and transaction fees were as follows (in thousands): 

Sales.  Sales increased
by $1.3 million, or 57%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in 2016 is mainly attributed to an increase in Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing segment sales in the United States. 

Licensing
and transaction fees . Licensing and transaction fees   include single and periodic payments
for distribution rights for our products. Transaction fees are paid by customers based on the volume of transactions processed
by systems that contain our products. Our licensing and transaction fees in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015, increased by $938,000, or 78%. This was mainly due to an increase in licensing of
our intellectual property rights to third parties in the United States (including licenses granted pursuant to settlements of legal
actions to enforce patent rights).  

We have historically derived
revenues from different geographical areas.  The following table sets forth our revenues (in thousands) and as a percentage
of revenues in different geographical areas, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015: 

Our revenues from sales
in Africa increased by $206,000, or 24%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in sales of Petroleum products. 

Our revenues from sales
in Europe increased by $404,000, or 32%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing segment products. 

Our revenues from sales
in Asia decreased by $258,000, or 47%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to a decrease in sales of Petroleum products and a decrease in sales of access control products. 

Our revenues from sales
in Americas increased by $1.8 million, or 252%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in sales of NFC readers in the United States and an increase in licensing of our
intellectual property rights to third parties in the United States. 

Our revenues derived from
outside the United States, which are primarily received in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, will have a varying impact upon
our total revenues, as a result of fluctuations in such currencies  exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. 

The following table sets
forth our revenues (in thousands) and as a percentage of revenues by segments, during the three months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015: 

Our revenues in the three
months ended September 30, 2016, from Petroleum increased by $43,000, or 4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015,
mainly due to an increase in sales of Petroleum products in Africa. 

Our revenues from Retail
and Mass Transit Ticketing in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased by $2.3 million, or 145%, compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in sales of NFC readers in the United States and an increase in licensing
of our intellectual property rights to third parties in the United States. 

Our revenues in the three
months ended September 30, 2016, from our Other segment decreased by $152,000, or 19%, compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to a decrease in sales of access control products in Asia. 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin  

Our cost of revenues,
presented by gross profit and gross margin percentage, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were
as follows (in thousands): 

Cost of sales .  Cost
of revenues relating to sales consists primarily of materials, as well as salaries, fees to subcontractors and related costs of
our technical staff that assemble our products.  The increase of $1 million, or 65%, in the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulted primarily from an increase in revenues. 

Cost of licensing.
 Cost of licensing revenues do not have directly attributable cost of revenues the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in the three months ended September 30, 2016 is due to transaction costs in connection with the increase in licensing
of our intellectual property rights to third parties in the United States. 

Gross margin. 
Gross margin in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, remained consistent. 

Operating expenses  

Our operating expenses
in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were as follows (in thousands): 

Research and development.   Our
research and development expenses consist primarily of the salaries and related expenses of our research and development staff,
as well as subcontracting expenses. The decrease of $177,000, or 23%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributed to a decrease in the number of research and development employees
due to our cost cutting plan. 

Selling and marketing.   Our
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and substantially all of the expenses of our sales and marketing subsidiaries
and offices in the United States, South Africa and Europe, as well as expenses related to advertising, professional expenses and
participation in exhibitions and tradeshows. The decrease of $223,000, or 15%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributed to a decrease in employment expenses of selling
and marketing employees who left the Company by the end of 2015. Our selling and marketing expenses may increase in the future
as we continue to expand our local sales and marketing efforts, open new offices and in the event that we hire additional personnel. 

General and administrative.   Our
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of our executive management and financial
and administrative staff. These expenses also include costs of our professional advisors (such as lawyers and accountants), office
expenses, insurance, general and administrative expenses and provision for doubtful accounts. The decrease of $241,000, or
24%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributed
to a decrease in employment expenses and to a decrease in professional expenses. 

Patent litigation
and maintenance expenses . Our patent litigation and maintenance expenses consist primarily of professional advisors related
to our patents and other IP, such as lawyers or other consultants, as part of the Company's plan to maximize the value of our IP,
and also consist of salaries and related expenses of our team of employees executing this strategy. The decrease of $348,000, or
99%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributed
to a decrease in employment expenses related to the termination of employment of one of our former directors as chief executive
officer of our U.S. subsidiary, who led the Company's efforts to maximize the value of our patents portfolio until August 2015. 

Other expenses. 
Our other expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2015 consist of partial compensation expenses related to the termination
of employment of our former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ofer Tziperman, according to his employment terms, following his resignation
from the Company and its subsidiaries on February 10, 2015 and compensation expenses related to the termination of employment of
our former Director and Chief Executive Officer of our U.S. subsidiary, Mr. Dimitrios Angelis, on August 3, 2015. In addition,
on September 4, 2016, we sold our headquarters building in Rosh Pina, Israel to a third party. As a result of this sale, we recorded
a loss of $83 under other operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Financing expenses, net  

Our financing expenses,
net, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were as follows (in thousands): 

Financing expenses consist
primarily of interest payable on bank loans, bank commissions and foreign exchange losses. Financing income consists primarily
of foreign exchange gains and from interest earned on investments in short-term deposits. The increase in financing income in the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, of $79,000, is mainly due to exchange
rate differentials and also to an increase in interest earned on investments in short-term deposits. Financing expenses in the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, remained consistent. 

Net income (loss) from continuing operations  

Our net income (loss)   from
continuing operations in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was as follows (in thousands): 

The change of $2.5 million,
in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an
increase in our sales, an increase in our gross profit, a decrease in our operating expenses and a decrease in financing expenses,
net, as described above. 

Net income (loss) from discontinued operations  

Our net   income (loss) from discontinued
operations in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was as follows (in thousands): 

In December 2013, we completed
the sale of certain assets, certain subsidiaries and IP assets directly related to our SmartID division. Further, in September
2016, we completed the sale of certain assets and IP relating to our previous parking business. 

The results from these
operations for the reporting periods are presented in the statements of operations as discontinued operations separately from continuing
operations. 

The net income from discontinued
operations of $391,000, in the three months ended September 30, 2015, is related to income from contingent consideration according
to an earn out mechanism as part of our SmartID divestiture, partially offset by the loss from operations activity of our previous
parking business. The net loss from discontinued operations of $279,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, is related
to the operations activity and sale of certain assets and IP relating our previous parking business. 

Net loss  

Our net loss in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was as follows (in thousands): 

The decrease in net loss
of $1.9 million, or 96%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015,
is primarily due to an increase in our sales, an increase in our gross profit, a decrease in our operating expenses and a
decrease in financing expenses, net, partially offset by the change in our results from discontinued operations as described above.    

Nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared

Sources of Revenue  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the revenues that we derived from sales and licensing and transaction fees were
as follows (in thousands): 

Sales . Sales increased
by $906,000, or 10%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
is mainly attributed to an increase in Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing segment sales in the United States and Europe. 

Licensing and
transaction fees . Our licensing and transaction fees in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, increased by $1 million, or 29%. This was mainly due to an increase in licensing of our intellectual
property rights to third parties in the United States (licensing including legal actions to enforce patent rights). 

We have historically derived
revenues from different geographical areas.  The following table sets forth our revenues (in thousands) and as a percentage
of revenues in different geographical areas, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015: 

Our revenues from sales
in Africa increased by $449,000, or 17%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in sales of our MediSmart products. 

Our revenues from sales
in Europe increased by $624,000, or 16%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in sales of our otiMetry solution. 

Our revenues from sales
in Asia decreased by $365,000, or 41%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to a decrease in sales of Petroleum and access control products. 

Our revenues from sales
in Americas increased by $1.2 million, or 22%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in licensing of our IP rights to third parties in the United States and an increase in sales
of NFC readers in the United States. 

Our revenues derived from
outside the United States, which are primarily received in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, will have a varying impact upon
our total revenues, as a result of fluctuations in such currencies  exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. 

The following table sets
forth our revenues (in thousands) and as a percentage of revenues by segments, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015: 

Our revenues in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, from Petroleum decreased by $112,000, or 4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in sales in Asia, partially offset by an increase in sales of Petroleum products in
South America. 

Our revenues from Retail
and Mass Transit Ticketing in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by $1.7 million, or 21%, compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to an increase in licensing of our intellectual property rights to third parties in
the United States, an increase of our otiMetry solution sales in Europe and an increase in sales of NFC readers in the United States. 

Our revenues in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, from our Other segment increased by $321,000, or 20%, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in sales of Other products was mainly due to an increase in sales of MediSmart products in East Africa,
partially offset by a decrease in sales of access control products. 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin  

Our cost of revenues,
presented by gross profit and gross margin percentage, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were
as follows (in thousands): 

Cost of sales.   Cost
of revenues relating to sales consists primarily of materials, as well as salaries, fees to subcontractors and related costs of
our technical staff that assemble our products. The increase of $680,000, or 10%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulted primarily from an increase in revenues. 

Cost of licensing. 
Cost of licensing revenues do not have directly attributable cost of revenues the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to transaction costs in connection with the increase in licensing of our intellectual
property rights to third parties in the United States. 

Gross margin.  The
increase in gross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, is
primarily attributed to a decrease in employment expenses due to our strategic decision to outsource all of our manufacturing and
product assembly to third-party vendors and to a favorable revenue mix. 

Operating expenses  

Our operating expenses
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were as follows (in thousands): 

Research and development.  
The decrease of $524,000, or 20%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015, is primarily attributed to a decrease in the number of research and development employees due to our cost cutting plan. 

Selling and marketing. 
The decrease of $714,000, or 15%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015, is primarily attributed to a decrease in employment expenses of selling and marketing employees who left the Company by the
end of 2015, and to a lesser extent to a decrease in exhibitions and traveling expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses may
increase in the future as we continue to expand our local sales and marketing efforts, open new offices and in the event that we
hire additional personnel. 

General and administrative.  The
decrease of $760,000, or 23%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
is primarily attributed to a decrease in employment expenses, a decrease in stock-based compensation related to options granted
to employees, a decrease in professional expenses and a decrease in office expenses. 

Patent litigation
and maintenance expenses . The decrease of $765,000, or 95%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributed to a decrease in employment expenses related to the termination of employment
of one of our former directors as chief executive officer of our U.S. subsidiary, who led the Company's efforts to maximize the
value of our patents portfolio until August 2015. 

Other expenses. 
Our other expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consist of partial compensation expenses provision related to the
termination of employment of our former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ofer Tziperman, according to his employment terms, following
his resignation from the Company and its subsidiaries on February 10, 2015, and partial compensation expenses related to the termination
of employment of our former Director and Chief Executive Officer of our U.S. subsidiary, Mr. Dimitrios Angelis, on August 3, 2015.
Our other expenses also consist of consulting fees as part of our strategic review. On September 4, 2016, we sold our headquarters
building in Rosh Pina, Israel to a third party. As a result of this sale, we recorded a loss of $83 under other operating expenses
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Financing expenses, net  

Our financing expenses,
net, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were as follows (in thousands): 

Financing expenses consist
primarily of interest payable on bank loans, bank commissions and foreign exchange losses. Financing income primarily of foreign

ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, of $53,000, or 64%, is mainly due to the exchange
rate differentials and interest income from deposits. The decrease in financing expenses in the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, of $273,000, or 46%, is mainly due to a decrease in the exchange rate
differentials of the U.S. dollar against other currencies and a decrease in interest expenses on short-term and long-term bank
credit.

Our net loss   from
continuing operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was as follows (in thousands): 

The decrease of $5.2
million, or 81%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily due
to an increase in our sales, an increase in our gross profit, a decrease in our operating expenses and a decrease in financing
expenses, net, as described above.  

Net income from discontinued operations  

Our net   income
from discontinued operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was as follows (in thousands): 

In December 2013, we completed
the sale of certain assets, certain subsidiaries and IP assets directly related to our SmartID division. Further, in September
2016, we completed the sale of certain assets and IP relating to our previous parking business. 

The results from these
operations for the reporting periods are presented in the statements of operations as discontinued operations separately from continuing
operations. 

The increase in net income
from discontinued operations of $987,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015, is mainly attributed to the $2.1 million settlement fee related to litigation with SuperCom Ltd., or Supercom, in connection
with the divestiture of our SmartID division, partially offset by the loss from operations activity and the sale of certain assets
and IP relating our previous parking business. 

Net income (loss)

in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was as follows (in thousands):

financing expenses, net, as described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our principal sources of
liquidity since our inception have been sales of equity securities, borrowings from banks, cash from the exercise of options and
warrants and proceeds from divestitures of parts of our businesses. We had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments representing
bank deposits of $12.9 million as of September 30, 2016 (of which an amount of $1.5 million has been pledged to secure performance
guarantees granted to third parties and guarantees to secure customer advances, loans and credit lines received from a bank), and
$10.9 million as of December 31, 2015 (of which an amount of $2.3 million had then been pledged to secure performance guarantees
granted to third parties and guarantees to secure customer advances, loans and credit lines received from a bank).  We
believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our operations in the next 12 months.  

We adhere to an investment
policy which is intended to enable the Company to avoid being classified as a  passive foreign investment company, 
or PFIC, under U.S. law. That said, we cannot provide complete assurance that PFIC status will be avoided in the future. In addition,
our investment policy requires investment in high-quality investment-grade securities. 

As of September 30, 2016,
our long-term bank loans are denominated in the following currencies: Polish Zloty ($1.5 million, with maturity dates ranging from
2016 through 2019) and South African Rand ($649,000, with maturity dates ranging from 2016 through 2023). As of September 30, 2016,
these loans bear interest at rates ranging from 3.15%-10.5% per annum. 

Our composition of long-term loans as of September
30, 2016, was as follows (in thousands):

loans, bank credit and current maturities of long-term loans as of September 30, 2016, were as follows (in thousands): 

On November
4, 2014, we signed a financial and restrictive covenant with Bank Leumi L Israel, or Bank Leumi, in order to secure bank
services and obtain bank credit and loans. On September 19, 2016, Bank Leumi definitively released us from any financial and restrictive
covenant requirements. 

On May 7, 2016,
we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell our headquarters building in Rosh Pina, Israel, to a third party
for a consideration of NIS 7 million, and pursuant to which we will lease back the portion of the building necessary for our current
operations. On September 4, 2016, the sale of the building was completed. As a result of the sale, we recorded a loss of $83,000
under other operating expenses presented in the statement of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016. 

For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we had a negative cash flow from continuing operations of $611,000. We may continue to suffer
from negative cash flow from operations. We are looking for ways to increase our cash resources, such as increasing our revenues
and profit, capitalizing on our patent portfolio, sales of assets or parts of our business or raising funds. In addition, we are
looking for ways to reduce our financial expenses, including repayment of debt instruments. 

On July 20, 2016
we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Atrinet, pursuant to which we sold to Atrinet, our former parking business, including
ongoing operations, transfer of related employees, as well as intellectual property directly related thereto, for a non-material
amount. The transaction closed on September 14, 2016. 

On
October 6, 2014, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, using a  shelf  registration process. The registration statement was declared
effective on October 22, 2014. As a result of the sale of our parking business and the resulting restatement of our operating
segments, we will not be able to use this registration statement until we restate our financial statements or otherwise incorporate
by reference the appropriate financial statements to be included in our next annual report filed under the Securities Exchange
Act  of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act .
