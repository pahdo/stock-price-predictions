               GOLD LAKES CORP.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)  April 30, 2016      1. ORGANIZATION       The Company, Gold Lakes Corp., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 18, 2007 with the authorized capital stock of 300,000,000 shares at $0.001 par value. On April 30, 2008, the Secretary of State for Nevada approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation where the total number of shares of common stock was increased to 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The Company was organized for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties.       2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Accounting Methods       The Company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting.       Dividend Policy       The Company has not yet adopted a policy regarding payment of dividends.       Basic and Diluted Net Income (loss) Per Share      Basic net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been issued on the exercise of the common share rights unless the exercise becomes anti-dilutive and then the basic and diluted per share amounts are the same. As of April 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has 80,287,932 and 115,225,525, respectively, of common stock equivalents outstanding, calculated using the if-converted method.        Income Taxes       The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to be reversed. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized.       Foreign Currency Translations       Part of the transactions of the Company were completed in Canadian dollars and have been translated to US dollars as incurred, at the exchange rate in effect at the time, and therefore, no gain or loss from the translation is recognized. The functional currency is US dollars.       Revenue Recognition       Revenue is recognized on the sale and delivery of a product or the completion of a service provided.       Advertising and Market Development       The Company expenses advertising and market development costs as incurred.                  7

              GOLD LAKES CORP.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (Unaudited)   April 30, 2016      2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)       Financial Instruments      The carrying amounts of financial instruments are considered by management to be their fair value due to their short term maturities.      Estimates and Assumptions      Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with general accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements.       Impairment of Long-lived Assets      The Company reviews and evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The assets are subject to impairment consideration under ASC 360-10-35-17 if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might not be recoverable. When the Company determines that an impairment analysis should be done, the analysis will be performed using rules of ASC 930-360-35, Asset Impairment, and 360-10-15-3 through 15-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.         Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration Costs       Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred. These costs are then assessed for impairment when factors are present to indicate the carrying costs may not be recoverable. Mineral exploration costs are expensed when incurred.      Statement of Cash Flows       For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.      Environmental Requirements      At the report date environmental requirements related to the mineral claim acquired are unknown and therefore any estimate of any future cost cannot be made.        Reclassifications      Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.                   8

              GOLD LAKES CORP.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (Unaudited)   April 30, 2016         2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)       Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, which eliminated certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously identified as "Development Stage Entities" (Topic 915). The amendments in this ASU simplify accounting guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The amendments also reduce data maintenance and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirement for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915.  The Company has adopted this standard.     In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The revenue recognition standard affects all entities that have contracts with customers, except for certain items. The new revenue recognition standard eliminates the transaction-and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replaces it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition.  Public entities are required to adopt the revenue recognition standard for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is not permitted for public entities. The Company has reviewed the applicable ASU and has not, at the current time, quantified the effects of this pronouncement, however it believes that there will be no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.      In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. A performance target in a share-based payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be accounted for as a performance condition under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. As a result, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award's grant date fair value. Compensation cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.  Management has reviewed the ASU and believes that they currently account for these awards in a manner consistent with the new guidance, therefore there is no anticipation of any effect to the consolidated financial statements.       We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation's reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.                 9

              GOLD LAKES CORP.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (Unaudited)   April 30, 2016      3. LOAN RECEIVABLE      On March 11, 2014, the Company agreed to a Loan document whereby it would lend $25,000 at no interest to an unrelated third party. As of April 30, 2016, $14,271 had been advanced under this loan agreement.      4. MINERAL PROPERTIES      On August 28, 2015, (amended March 21, 2016) the Company entered into an Equity Participation and Earn-In Agreement (the "Agreement") with Flex Mining Ltd., a Delaware Corporation ("Flex"). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has the right to acquire 100% of Flex by incurring expenditures of $1 million over the next three years. The initial phase is expected to cost $67,500; and if successful in Phase 1, Phase 2 is budgeted at$310,400. The balance, of  $622,100 will be spent subject to the success of Phase 2. In addition, the Company issued 23,500,000 shares of restricted common stock to Flex. Although the Agreement stipulates a deemed value of $0.05 per share, the transaction has been recorded at the market value at the date the shares were issued which was $1.00 per share, and the value of the Agreement was determined to be $23,500,000.      The Company has incurred expenditures of $50,500 renewing the mining claims and planning the exploration during the last quarter.     Management determined that there was an impairment of the investment in the amount of $23,500,000 was warranted due to firstly that, no exploration being conducted on the property to date; and secondly that, no mineral resource having been identified on the property to date.      The Mining Claims are known as the "Big Monty Property" and are located in the Frecheville and Stoughton Townships, Ontario, Larder Lake District. The Claims currently in Big Monty are:                  GOLD LAKES CORP.    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)  April 30, 2016      5. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE            On July 31, 2012, the Company converted $40,000 in accounts payable to a convertible promissory note. The note has a 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of July 31, 2013. The note is currently in arrears and is due and payable on demand. The note is convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.001.   The Company is currently in default on this note.   Per ASC 470-50-40-10b, as this transaction added a substantive conversion feature to the debt, we have determined debt extinguishment accounting rules apply. However, as there was no difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the old debt, no gain or loss was recorded. The Company amortized the discount on the debt equal to the face value, in the amount of $40,000 for the year ended July 31, 2013. This discount was amortized to interest expense. During the period ended April 30, 2016, $8,800 of debt was converted into 8,800,000 shares of common stock. Given that the market price of the shares on the date of conversion was $0.50 per share or $4,400,000, there was a conversion benefit of the difference between $4,400,000 market value of debt when converted into common shares and the $8,800 book value of the debt. This difference of $4,391,200 has been expensed as a loss on conversion of debt during the current period.     On July 31, 2012, the Company converted $76,000 in advances to a convertible promissory note. The note has a 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of July 31, 2013. The note is currently in arrears and is due and payable on demand.   The Company is currently in default on this note.  The note was convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.001. Per ASC 470-50-40-10b, as this transaction added a substantive conversion feature to the debt, we have determined debt extinguishment accounting rules apply. However, as there was no difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the old debt, no gain or loss was recorded. On December 23, 2015, The Company acquired the full face of the $76,000 promissory note and the $25,819 of accrued interest for $5,000 resulting in a gain on the settlement of debt of $96,819.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      During the period, the Company has paid its officer consulting fees of $5,000 (2015 - $nil) and rent of $3,000 (2015 - $nil). On October 15, 2015, the Company remunerated the officer of the Company 400,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The price of the stock was $0.43 and a charge of $172,000 has been expensed as Shares for Service.       7.

NOTE PAYABLE      The Company has received $17,500 under a promissory note agreement with a third party in July 2012. An additional $4,000 was received under this Note in 2014. Interest and principal were due on September 15, 2012. The Company is currently in default on this Note. Per the note agreement, interest of $11,768 was accrued through April 30, 2016 and has been disclosed on the balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued interest.        9. GOING CONCERN      The Company will need additional working capital to service its debt and to develop the mineral claims acquired, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional working capital and the management of the Company has developed a strategy, which it believes will accomplish this objective through additional equity funding, and long term financing, which will enable the Company to operate for the coming year.             ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Overview      We were incorporated on January 18, 2007 in the State of Nevada under the name Siga Resources Inc. On October 23, 2013, we changed our name to TNX Maverick Corp. On August 24, 2015, we changed our name to Gold Lakes Corp. and effected a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. We do not have any subsidiaries or affiliated companies. As of April 30, 2016 we had 33,135,645 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. We are authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. We have no other class of stock.      We are an exploration stage company and have not generated any revenues from our exploration activities. Further, we have not generated any revenues since our formation on January 18, 2007. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our exploration activities. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services.     To become profitable and competitive, we must commence our exploration of the Big Monty Claims or resurrect our ownership interest in the Lucky Thirteen Claim by making the requisite payments under our agreement with Peter Osha. Otherwise, we must find alternative mining claims. We must obtain financing to provide the capital required to implement our phased exploration program. We have no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we will be unable to commence, continue, develop or expand our exploration activities. Even if available, equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.     Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. This is because we have not generated any revenues to date, and no revenues are anticipated until we begin developing, removing and selling minerals. Accordingly, we must raise capital from other sources. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in the Company.     To meet our need for cash we must raise additional capital. We will attempt to raise additional money through a private placement, public offering, or through loans. Our continued operations may involve many years of exploration, and will require expenditure of substantial amounts of money. If we cannot raise enough capital to fund our continued operations, we may need to abandon our planned exploration activities and cease operations altogether.      We estimate we will require $214,535 in cash over the next twelve months. For a detailed breakdown refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below. Additional cash will be required to cover the cost of completing the exploration work for the Big Monty Claims. Phase One of the exploration work is estimated to cost $67,500, and Phase Two is estimated to cost approximately $310,400.             Results of Operations       The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015. We have not generated any operating revenues since inception.    Results of Operations for the Three-Month Periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015      We generated no revenue for the three months ended April 30, 2016, and no revenue for the three months ended April 30, 2015. Our operating expenses were $654,866 for the three months ended April 30, 2016, compared to $5,613 for the three months ended April 30, 2015. We had a net loss of $654,866 for the three months ended April 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $5,613 for the three months ended April 30, 2015. The significant increase in net loss during the three months ended April 30, 2016 was due to an increase in expenses, loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities, amortization of discount on convertible debentures, and the issuance of shares for services. The following table reflects our operating expenses incurred during the three month periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015.                    Results of Operations for the Nine-Month Periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015      We generated no revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2016, and no revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2015. Our operating expenses were $28,908,967 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016, compared to $16,820 for the nine months ended April 30, 2015. We had a net loss of $28,908,967 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $16,820 for the nine months ended April 30, 2015. The significant increase in net loss during the nine months ended April 30, 2016 was due primarily to a write down of our mineral properties (relating to the issuance of shares in exchange for the acquisition of the Big Monty Claims), as well as increased expenses, loss on conversion of debt, amortization of discount on convertible debentures, and the issuance of shares for services.. The following table reflects our operating expenses incurred during the nine month periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015.             We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we further implement our business plan and mineral exploration activities. Such increase in expenses will be attributable to the costs of raising additional capital, implementing our exploration program, and continuing as a public reporting company.              Liquidity and Capital Resources        Balance Sheets      As of April 30, 2016, our total assets were $128,456, in comparison to $0 as of July 31, 2015. Total cash, as of April 30, 2016, was $14,459, in comparison to $0 in cash as of July 31, 2015. Our total liabilities were $1,128,772 as of April 30, 2016, in comparison to $272,294 as of July 31, 2015. The increase in assets was due to increased cash on hand and investments in mineral properties. The increase in liabilities was due to derivative liabilities of convertible debentures.      Total stockholders' deficit as of April 30, 2016 was $1,000,316, in comparison to $272,294 as of July 31, 2015. We had 33,135,645 total shares outstanding as of April 30, 2016, in comparison to 225,525 shares outstanding as of July 31, 2015.       Estimated Expenses        We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we further implement our business plan and mineral exploration activities. Such increase in expenses will be attributable to the costs of raising additional capital, implementing our exploration program, and continuing as a publicly reporting company.      Our estimated expenses for completion of our exploration program on the Big Monty Claims total approximately $377,900, which includes the estimated expenses for Phase One and Phase Two of our exploration program. Phase One will primarily involve mapping and sampling activities to develop the basic information needed to apply for a formal exploration permit and work plan. Phase Two will involve more extensive exploration, including pitting, trenching, possible additional ground based geophysical surveys, and drilling, which will ultimately lead to the discovery phase. Our Phase Two activities could take up to one year to complete, and the costs of Phase Two may increase if our exploration activities are successful and we decide to extend the length of Phase Two.      The balance of our $1,000,000 requisite expenditures on the Big Monty Claims under our Flex Agreement with Flex Mining Ltd. will be made dependent on the success of Phases One and Two. There are currently no permanent facilities, plants, buildings or equipment on the Big Monty Claims.      We intend to complete the exploration work on the Big Monty Claims. No exact date has been determined for the commencement of exploration work on the Big Monty Claims, although we plan to begin Phase One exploration work in August 2016.            Not including the cost of completing the exploration phase of our Big Monty project, our non-elective expenses over the next twelve months are expected to be as follows:         ____________          (i)     Accounting and Audit. We will have to continue to prepare financial statements for submission with the various 10-K and 10-Q reports as follows:            ______________                 (iii)     Filing Fees in Nevada. To maintain the status of the Company in good standing in the State of Nevada, an annual fee of approximately $375 must be paid to the Secretary of State.            (iv)     Office and General. We have estimated a cost of approximately $25,000 for photocopying, printing, fax and delivery, travel, transfer agent and entertainment. Director Fees total $1,500 per month or $18,000. Total Office and General is estimated to be $43,000.                 (v)     Pursuant to our Flex Agreement and the Flex Addendum, we were required to pay $15,000 to Flex within 180 days following the Effective Date of the Flex Addendum. To date, we have paid $6,000 to Flex. The amount noted above represents the outstanding amount owed to Flex pursuant to the Flex Addendum.             (vi)     Pursuant to our Securities Purchase Agreement with Himmil, we agreed to pay up to $35,000 in reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred by Himmil in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement.                 Recent Acquisitions and Financing Arrangements       Our future operations are dependent upon our ability to obtain third party financing in the form of debt and equity, and ultimately to generate future profitable operations or income from investments. As of April 30, 2016, we have not generated revenues, and have experienced negative cash flow from operations. We may look to secure additional funds through future debt or equity financings. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. The following summarizes our financing transactions and activity during the period ended April 30, 2016.      On August 28, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flex Mining Ltd., pursuant to which we issued 23,500,000 (pre-split) shares of restricted common stock to Flex (the "Flex Agreement"). Under the terms of the Flex Agreement, we became eligible to earn 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Flex by investing $1,000,000 in property expenditures on Flex's properties over the next three years. On March 21, 2016, we entered into the Flex Addendum with Flex, which transformed our arrangement from an equity earn-in agreement to an asset acquisition. Under the Flex Addendum, we acquired substantially all of Flex's assets, including the Big Monty Claims in Northern Ontario, Canada, in part exchange for our continued commitment to incur $1 million in required expenditures over the next three years on the Big Monty Claims. If we fail to incur the required expenditures under the Flex Addendum, Flex will have the option to repurchase the assets from us at a price to be mutually agreed upon by the parties.      On February 25, 2016, we issued a $27,500 convertible promissory note to an accredited institutional investor. The note has an eight percent (8%) per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 25, 2017. Closing costs of $9,050 are being amortized over the life of the loan. The note is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time at a rate of 50% of the lowest trading price of the shares over the previous 20-day trading period. The amount owing under this note will be paid off upon the closing and issuance of the Additional Convertible Note pursuant to our Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Himmil Investments Ltd. ("Himmil").      Our current operational focus is to conduct exploration activities on the Big Monty Claims and to complete the terms of the Flex Addendum and Flex Agreement. In order to finance our planned exploration activities, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Himmil on March 14, 2016. The Purchase Agreement is more particularly described in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended, originally filed with the SEC on April 11, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we issued an initial senior convertible note in the principal amount of $535,000 (subject to reduction), along with warrants to purchase up to 521,875 (pre-split) shares of our common stock, for a purchase price of $285,000. $250,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the note (together with any accrued and unpaid interest related thereto) will be automatically extinguished if this Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Deadline (as defined in our Registration Rights Agreement with Himmil) and no event of default has occurred. Additionally, upon the effectiveness of this Registration Statement, we may require Himmil to purchase an additional convertible note in the principal amount of $300,000 for a purchase price of $300,000. The proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes to Himmil will be used to fund our planned exploration activities, repay other outstanding promissory notes and for general corporate and working capital purposes.     Our cash requirements are significant due to planned exploration activities and anticipated future development activities. While obtaining $585,000 through our financings with Himmil will provide us with enough cash to execute our business strategy over the next twelve months, there are no assurances that our future working capital or cash flows will be sufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debts as they become due will depend on our future performance and our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Failure to pay our interest expense or make our principal payments would result in a default, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may be forced to sell or liquidate assets, obtain additional equity capital or refinance or restructure all or a portion of our outstanding debt on terms that may be less favorable to us. In the event that we are unable to do so, we may be left without sufficient liquidity, and we may not be able to repay our debt.             Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.       Critical Accounting Policies       Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, including our discussion on liquidity and capital resources, is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions considered to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments.          ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK         Not required.        ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of April 30, 2016 pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the quarterly period ended April 30, 2016 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") rules and forms. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.            In performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses:                       The Company has limited segregation of duties, which means we have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions.                        The Company does not have a written internal control procedures manual outlining the duties and reporting requirements of the directors, officers and any employees to be hired in the future.                        We have insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls.                        We did not perform an entity level risk assessment to evaluate the implication of relevant risks on financial reporting.         Our management believes the weaknesses identified above have not had any effect on the financial results of the Company. We will endeavor to correct the above noted weaknesses in internal control once we have adequate funds to do so. The future addition of other Board Members and staff will help us to address the segregation of duties issue, and establishing a written policy manual outlining the duties of each of the Company's officers and staff members will facilitate better internal control procedures.      Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and procedures and its internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis. Our management is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.       Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting       There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarterly period ending April 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to material affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II   OTHER INFORMATION           ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       None.       ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS       Not required.        ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       On February 25, 2016, the Company issued a $27,500 convertible promissory note to an accredited institutional investor. The note has an eight percent (8%) per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 25, 2017. Closing costs of $9,050 are being amortized over the life of the loan. The note is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time at a rate of 50% of the lowest trading price of the shares over the previous 20-day trading period. The amount owing under this note will be paid off upon the closing and issuance of the Additional Convertible Note. This note was issued to an "accredited investor", as defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The issuance of the note was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the exemption for transactions by an issuer not involved in any public offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D.     On April 1, 2016, the Company issued 10,000 restricted shares of common stock to Motion Communications, Inc. as compensation for website development services provided to the Company. The shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.        ITEM 3.  DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES       None.        ITEM 4.
