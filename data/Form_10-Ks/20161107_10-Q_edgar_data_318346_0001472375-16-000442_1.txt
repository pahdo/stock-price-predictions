Item 2:  
                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
  
 The partnership conducts no operations.  It developed and owns the rights to certain electronics products and licenses the manufacturing and sales as described below.  It recognizes income only when royalties are actually paid over to the partership by the lincensee.  
  The partnership originally licensed the manufacturing and sale of  its products to Communications Research Corporation, (CRC) a  subsidiary of Energy Sciences Corporation, (ESC).  ESC and the  Partnership entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on April 29,  1986.  On May 13, 1988, ESC's bankruptcy was dismissed and all  remaining assets, primarily amounts owed to ESC, including amounts  owed by the partnership, and the rights to produce electronic  products at CRC, were repossessed by the sole secured creditor of  ESC, Mr. Thomas Murphy.  A new company was formed in September  1988, called LINC Technology Corporation. The company ownership  was restructured in 2005 and is now owned by Messrs. Maes and  Steffey in the amount of 41% each; the balance of 18% ownership  is held by Mr. Murphy's heirs, Mr. Nichols, a founder, and by  outside investors. Mr. Nichols resigned from LINC in August 1991,  but remains a stockholder.  LINC has been initially privately  financed with $49,000 of cash to pursue a variety of opportunities  in data communications.  LINC believes that a market remains for  some of the partnerships' products. Emphasis is on LCM and DOVE.  A license has been entered into between the partnership and LINC,  similar in terms to that which existed with CRC, with the  exception that in return for elimination of most of the debt owed  by the partnerships to ESC (and now, therefore, Mr.Murphy's heirs)  and in recognition of the need to attract more capital for LINC,  the royalty to be paid the partnership is set at 5% of gross sales,  (compared to the prior formula, ranging from 10% down to 6%).  The new royalty is divided between the partnership and four other  partnerships in the case of joint ownership of rights, such as the  case with DOVE, for example.  All royalties were deferred for  three years from September 1988 in order to allow LINC to build  its working capital.  
  In 1995, a new royalty agreement was put into effect in order to  reduce administrative expenses.  Under the new plan, no royalties  will accrue to the partnership until a total of $300,000.00 of  sales on products licensed to LINC Technology Corporation have  been generated and collected.  At that point, a lump sum royalty  payment of $15,000.00 will be paid to the partnership group of  TASA Products Limited (the Partnership), Energy Sciences Limited  Partnership, Telemetric Controls Limited Partnership, and  Communications Link Limited Partnership.  After such payment,  again no royalty will accrue or be owed until another $300,000.00  in sales has occured, after which a second lump sum of $15,000.00  is due, and so forth.   LINC Technology Corporation will be  responsible for periodic mailings to the partnership at its  expense.  Based on IRS regulations, no partnership 1065 tax  returns and K-1s will have to be filed or issued until the royalty  is paid.  Royalties of $12,118 were paid to the Partnership in  December 1999 and a total disbursement of $10,906 was made to the  limited partners in February 2000.  $1,212 was paid to historical  creditors of the partnership.  The general partners did not  receive any payments from the partnership.  
 In 2003, as the amount of sales was      approaching $300,000 again, the General Partners reviewed the      costs associated with preparing the partnership tax returns (Form      1065) and the preparation and mailing of both the K-1s and      distribution checks.  Based on our experience in 2000, the      General Partners estimated the cost to be approximately $5000.00.       In addition, the General Partners heard from many Limited Partners      that the trouble involved in providing the tax information to      their accountants was not worth the money that they received.  The      General Partners therefore increased the level of sales required      before a royalty payment is due from $300,000 to $600,000, which      would result in a royalty payment totaling $30,000 instead of      $15,000 to be divided among all individual limited partners, the      amount will be $30,000.  As a result, a smaller percentage of the      royalty would go to tax form, check preparation, mailing costs.     As a result of this new arrangement, no royalties were paid in this      fiscal period.  
 LINC Technology had planned to make a distribution to the      partnerships in late 2008. The effects of the current recession     have thus far prevented that from happening. It is not known if     the payment and distribution can take place in late 2016.  
  Only a small portion of LINC Technology Corporation's sales  were for products which the Partnership licenses to LINC  Technology Corporation.  Accounting of the amount of sales on  products subject to partnership royalty will not be done until  the end of the calender year.  
  LINC Technology Corporation's new office and production facility is in      Issaquah, WA 98027 and telephone 425-882-2206.  Modest sales of      the partnership's products continue to be made but are still      irregular quarter to quarter.  The company concentrates on      industrial data communications.  There can be no guarantee that      LINC will be successful, or that sufficient sales of the      partnership's products will result so that any significant      royalties will be paid to the partnership.  No royalties or      expenses were accrued by or paid to the partnership in the quarter      ending 9-30-2016 .  
  Mr. Steffey resigned as a General Partner of TASA Products Limited     in January 2016, citing potential conflict of interest as president     of Linc Technology Corp. Mr. Maes is now the sole General Partner of     TASA Products Limited.  

Item 3:  
                Market Risk  
  
 The partnerships units are not tradeable and no market exists for them.         The units can be transfered to or from family trusts or by inheritence. 
  
  Item 4:  
                Controls and Procedures  
  
  The Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures are designed      to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports      that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of      1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported      within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the      Securities and Exchange Commission.  Disclosure controls and      procedures include, without limitation, controls and proceedures      designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an      issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is      accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management including      its principal executive and principal financial officers, or      persons performing similar functions (the General Partner), as      appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required      disclosure.  
 The General Partner has reviewed the effectiveness of the      Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of      the period covered by this Form 10-Q report and have concluded      that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial      reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016   that      have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially      affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
