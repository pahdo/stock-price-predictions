NOTE
1   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows at September 30, 2015, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed
financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December
31, 2014 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full years.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles, generally accepted in the United
States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has sustained losses
of $2,137,829 from June 7, 2005 (inception) through September 30, 2015, including a loss of $532,491 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Furthermore, the Company has recognized only minimal revenue since its inception, which raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

In
view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent
upon the Company's ability to meet its current obligations on a continuing basis, to obtain financing, to acquire additional capital
from investors, and to succeed in its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue in existence.  The Company needs to obtain capital, either long-term debt or equity
to continue the implementation of its overall business plan. The Company plans on pursuing the additional capital necessary to
continue its overall business plan.  

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Business
and Basis of Presentation   

Uplift

distributing a nutritional supplement drink mix. The Company s operations are based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Company

equivalents. The Company has no common stock equivalents for all periods presented.  

Accounting
Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimated.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.   

MCB
Network Corp. purchased the control block of voting common shares of Uplift Nutrition, Inc. ( Uplift  or the  Company )
on June 12, 2015.  At that time Uplift, a nutritional supplement sales company and web developer, operating several web sites
for distribution of its products, ceased all of its business and transitioned to the media sector company. 
MCB Networks Corp. was a Spanish-language media entity that had Spanish content and distribution channels in several cities
in the United States.  Due to capital constraints, the business plan of MCB Network Corp. was not realized and plans
to continue operations were discontinued, with several shareholders obtaining ownership of its control block of voting common
shares with the intention of identifying and acquiring an alternative business for Uplift and its shareholders. 
Uplift is continuing today to raise new capital and new management is continuing to seek to acquire a new business, either
through acquisition or merger. Accordingly, with a keen objective of growing and merging with a successful business in the
very near future, Uplift continues to engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.

liabilities at September 30, 2015 were $12,384, consisting of $12,171 in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $213 in notes
payable, net of debt discounts. At December 31, 2014, total liabilities were $117,447 consisting of $13,672 in accounts payable
and accrued expenses, $2,463 in accrued interest due to related parties, $41,312 in related-party payables and $60,000 in notes
payable.  

Because
we currently have no revenues and limited available cash, for the immediate future we believe we will have to rely on potential
advances from stockholders to continue to implement our business activities. There is no assurance that our stockholders will
continue indefinitely to provide additional funds or pay our expenses.  It is likely the only other source of funding future
operations will be through the private sale of our securities, either equity or debt.  

At
September 30, 2015, we had stockholders  deficit of $12,384 compared to stockholders  deficit of $106,293 at December
31, 2014. The decreased deficit is primarily due to the issuance of common stock to satisfy outstanding debts.

4. Controls and Procedures    

Management s
Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  Disclosure and control procedures are
also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer
and principal accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly,
even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives.
 Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable
judgment.  Based on the evaluation described above, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
accounting officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to
a lack of adequate segregation of duties and the absence of an audit committee.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting
