FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF CINCINNATI 
    
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Background Information       
    
  The Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the FHLB), a federally chartered corporation, is one of   11   District Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks). The FHLBanks serve the public by enhancing the availability of credit for residential mortgages and targeted community development. The FHLB is regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency). 

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying interim financial statements of the FHLB have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The interim financial statements presented are unaudited, but they include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for such periods. These financial statements do not include all disclosures associated with annual financial statements and accordingly should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes included in the FHLB's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Results for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full year. 
    
  The FHLB presents certain financial instruments, including derivative instruments and securities purchased under agreements to resell, on a net basis when it has a legal right of offset and all other requirements for netting are met (collectively referred to as the netting requirements). For these instruments, the FHLB has elected to offset its asset and liability positions, as well as cash collateral received or pledged, when it has met the netting requirements. The FHLB did not have any offsetting liabilities related to its securities purchased under agreements to resell for the periods presented. 
    
  The net exposure for these financial instruments can change on a daily basis; therefore, there may be a delay between the time this exposure change is identified and additional collateral is requested, and the time this collateral is received or pledged. Likewise, there may be a delay for excess collateral to be returned. For derivative instruments that meet the requirements for netting, any excess cash collateral received or pledged is recognized as a derivative liability or derivative asset. Additional information regarding these agreements is provided in Note 10. Based on the fair value of the related collateral held, the securities purchased under agreements to resell were fully collateralized for the periods presented. For more information about the FHLB's investments in securities purchased under agreements to resell, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the FHLB's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The FHLB has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure through the issuance of these financial statements and believes there have been no material subsequent events requiring additional disclosure or recognition in these financial statements. 

Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Interpretations  
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   On August 26, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the Statement of Cash Flows. This guidance is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for the FHLB for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The FHLB is in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on the FHLB s cash flows is not expected to be material.

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the accounting of credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments require entities to immediately record the full amount of expected credit losses in their loan portfolios. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The guidance also requires, among other things, credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses and expanded disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for the FHLB for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application is permitted as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance should be applied using a modified-retrospective approach, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. In addition, entities are required to use a prospective transition approach for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The FHLB is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the FHLB s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined.  
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.     On March 14, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. The guidance requires entities to apply only the four-step decision sequence when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. This guidance becomes effective for the FHLB for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the period for which the amendments are effective. The FHLB is in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on the FHLB's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is not expected to be material. 
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.     On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under GAAP does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. This guidance becomes effective for the FHLB for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments provide entities with the option to apply the guidance using either a prospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, retrospectively applied to all derivative instruments that meet the specific conditions. The FHLB elected to adopt the guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the FHLB's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  Leases.   On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the Statement of Condition and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. In particular, this guidance requires a lessee, of operating or finance leases, to recognize on the Statement of Condition a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. However, for leases with a term of 12 month or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.     The guidance becomes effective for the FHLB for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early application is permitted. The guidance requires lessors and lessees to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. The FHLB is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the FHLB's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance includes, but is not limited to, the following:  

Requires equity investments (with certain exceptions) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 
                
    Requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected the fair value option.  
                
    Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the Statement of Condition or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.   
                
    Eliminates the requirement for public entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the Statement of Condition.

The guidance becomes effective for the FHLB for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is only permitted for certain provisions. The amendments, in general, should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Statement of Condition as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The FHLB is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the FHLB's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined.  
  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the accounting for cloud computing arrangements. The amendments provide guidance to customers on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If the arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This guidance became effective for the FHLB for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016, and was adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance had no material effect on the FHLB's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  
    
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the Statement of Condition as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. This guidance became effective for the FHLB for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016. As a result of adopting this guidance, unamortized concessions (in thousands) of $  13,042   included in other assets at December 31, 2015 were reclassified as a reduction in the balance of the corresponding Consolidated Obligations. The reclassification resulted in a decrease (in thousands) of $  13,042   in Consolidated Bonds at December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the FHLB's total assets and total liabilities each decreased by (in thousands) $  13,042   at December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the FHLB's results of operations and cash flows.

Realized Gains and Losses.   From time to time the FHLB may sell securities out of its held-to-maturity portfolio. These securities, generally, have less than 15 percent of the acquired principal outstanding at the time of the sale. These sales are considered maturities for the purposes of security classification. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the FHLB did not sell any held-to-maturity securities.                       

Note 6 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis 
    
  The FHLB evaluates any of its individual available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities holdings in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. 
    
  For its Other U.S. obligations and GSE investments (mortgage-backed securities and non-mortgage-backed securities), the FHLB has determined that the strength of the issuers' guarantees through direct obligations or support from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect the FHLB from losses based on current expectations. As a result, the FHLB determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on these investments were temporary as the declines in market value of these securities were not attributable to credit quality. Furthermore, the FHLB does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that the FHLB will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. As a result, the FHLB did not consider any of these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The FHLB did not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 7 - Advances 
    
  The FHLB offers a wide range of fixed- and variable-rate Advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics and optionality. The following table presents Advance redemptions by contractual maturity, including index-amortizing Advances, which are presented according to their predetermined amortization schedules.

Table 7.1 - Advance Redemption Terms (dollars in thousands) 

The FHLB offers certain fixed and variable-rate Advances to members that may be prepaid on specified dates (call dates) without incurring prepayment or termination fees (callable Advances). If the call option is exercised, replacement funding may be available to members. Other Advances may only be prepaid subject to a prepayment fee paid to the FHLB that makes the FHLB financially indifferent to the prepayment of the Advance. 
    
  Table 7.2 - Advances by Year of Contractual Maturity or Next Call Date (in thousands) 

The FHLB also offers putable Advances. With a putable Advance, the FHLB effectively purchases put options from the member that allows the FHLB to terminate the Advance at predetermined dates. The FHLB normally would exercise its put option when interest rates increase relative to contractual rates.

Note 9   - Allowance for Credit Losses  
    
  The FHLB has established an allowance methodology for each of the FHLB's portfolio segments: credit products (Advances, Letters of Credit and other extensions of credit to members); FHA mortgage loans held for portfolio; and conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio.   
    
  Credit products 
    
  The FHLB manages its credit exposure to credit products through an integrated approach that includes establishing a credit limit for each borrower, includes an ongoing review of each borrower's financial condition and is coupled with collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, the FHLB lends to eligible borrowers in accordance with federal statutes, including the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 (the FHLBank Act) and Finance Agency regulations, which require the FHLB to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure credit products. The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each member's credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the value of the collateral. The FHLB accepts certain investment securities, residential mortgage loans, deposits and other real estate related assets as collateral. In addition, community financial institutions are eligible to utilize expanded statutory collateral provisions for small business, agriculture loans and community development loans. The FHLB's capital stock owned by its member borrowers is also pledged as collateral. Collateral arrangements and a member s borrowing capacity vary based on the financial condition and performance of the institution, the types of collateral pledged and the overall quality of those assets. The FHLB can also require additional or substitute collateral to protect its security interest. Management of the FHLB believes that these policies effectively manage the FHLB's credit risk from credit products. 
    
  Members experiencing financial difficulties are subject to FHLB-performed  stress tests  of the impact of poorly performing assets on the member s capital and loss reserve positions. Depending on the results of these tests and the level of overcollateralization, a member may be allowed to maintain pledged loan assets in its custody, may be required to deliver those loans into the custody of the FHLB or its agent, and/or may be required to provide details on these loans to facilitate an estimate of their fair value. The FHLB perfects its security interest in all pledged collateral. The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the FHLB by a member priority over the claims or rights of any other party except for claims or rights of a third party that would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and that are held by a bona fide purchaser for value or by a secured party holding a prior perfected security interest.  
    
  Using a risk-based approach, the FHLB considers the payment status, collateralization levels, and borrower's financial condition to be indicators of credit quality for its credit products. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the FHLB had rights to collateral on a member-by-member basis with an estimated value in excess of its outstanding extensions of credit.  
  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

The FHLB evaluates and makes changes to its collateral guidelines, as necessary, based on current market conditions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the FHLB did not have any Advances that were past due, in non-accrual status or impaired. In addition, there were no troubled debt restructurings related to credit products of the FHLB during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  The FHLB has not experienced any credit losses on Advances since it was founded in 1932. Based upon the collateral held as security, its credit extension and collateral policies and the repayment history on credit products, the FHLB did not record any credit losses on credit products as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . Accordingly, the FHLB did not record any allowance for credit losses on Advances.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the FHLB did not record any liability to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. See   Note 19   for additional information on the FHLB's off-balance sheet credit exposure. 
    
  Mortgage     Loans Held for Portfolio     - FHA 
    
  The FHLB invests in fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties insured by the FHA. The FHLB expects to recover any losses from such loans from the FHA. Any losses from these loans that are not recovered from the FHA would be due to a claim rejection by the FHA and, as such, would be recoverable from the selling participating financial institutions. Therefore, the FHLB only has credit risk for these loans if the seller or servicer fails to pay for losses not covered by the FHA insurance. As a result, the FHLB did not establish an allowance for credit losses on its FHA insured mortgage loans. Furthermore, due to the insurance, none of these mortgage loans have been placed on non-accrual status. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio - Conventional Mortgage Purchase Program (MPP) 
    
  The FHLB determines the allowance for conventional loans through analyses that include consideration of various data observations such as past performance, current performance, loan portfolio characteristics, collateral-related characteristics, industry data, and prevailing economic conditions. The measurement of the allowance for credit losses consists of: (1) collectively evaluating homogeneous pools of residential mortgage loans; (2) reviewing specifically identified loans for impairment; and (3) considering other relevant qualitative factors.   
    
  Collectively Evaluated Mortgage Loans.   The credit risk analysis of conventional loans evaluated collectively for impairment considers historical delinquency migration, applies estimated loss severities, and incorporates the associated credit enhancements in order to determine the FHLB's best estimate of probable incurred losses at the reporting date. The FHLB performs the credit risk analysis of all conventional mortgage loans at the individual Master Commitment Contract level to properly determine the credit enhancements available to recover losses on loans under each individual Master Commitment Contract. The Master Commitment Contract is an agreement with a member in which the member agrees to make a best efforts attempt to sell a specific dollar amount of loans to the FHLB generally over a one-year period. Migration analysis is a methodology for determining, through the FHLB's experience over a historical period, the rate of default on loans. The FHLB applies migration analysis to loans based on payment status categories such as current, 30, 60, and 90 days past due. The FHLB then estimates, based on historical experience, how many loans in these categories may migrate to a loss realization event and applies a current loss severity to estimate losses. The estimated losses are then reduced by the probable cash flows resulting from available credit enhancements. Any credit enhancement cash flows that are projected and assessed as not probable of receipt do not reduce estimated losses. 
    
  Individually Evaluated Mortgage Loans.   Conventional mortgage loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings are specifically identified for purposes of calculating the allowance for credit losses. The FHLB measures impairment of these specifically identified loans by either estimating the present value of expected cash flows, estimating the loan's observable market price, or estimating the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The FHLB removes specifically identified loans evaluated for impairment from the collectively evaluated mortgage loan population.  
    
  Qualitative Factors.   The FHLB also assesses other qualitative factors in its estimation of loan losses for the collectively evaluated population. This amount represents a subjective management judgment, based on facts and circumstances that exist as of the reporting date, that is intended to cover other incurred losses that may not otherwise be captured in the methodology described above.  
    
  Rollforward of Allowance for Credit Losses on Mortgage Loans.   The following tables present a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses on conventional mortgage loans as well as the recorded investment in mortgage loans by impairment methodology. The recorded investment in a loan is the unpaid principal balance of the loan adjusted for accrued interest,

Table 9.2 - Allowance for Credit Losses and Recorded Investment on Conventional Mortgage Loans by Impairment Methodology (in thousands) 

Credit Enhancements.   The conventional mortgage loans under the MPP are supported by some combination of credit enhancements (primary mortgage insurance (PMI), supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI) and the Lender Risk Account (LRA), including pooled LRA for those members participating in an aggregated MPP pool). The amount of credit enhancements needed to protect the FHLB against credit losses is determined through use of a third-party default model. These credit enhancements apply after a homeowner's equity is exhausted. Beginning in February 2011, the FHLB discontinued the use of SMI for all new loan purchases and replaced it with expanded use of the LRA. The LRA is funded by the FHLB as a portion of the purchase proceeds to cover expected losses. The LRA is recorded in other liabilities in the Statements of Condition. Excess funds over required balances are distributed to the member in accordance with a step-down schedule that is established upon execution of a Master Commitment Contract, subject to performance of the related loan pool. The LRA established for a pool of loans is limited to only covering losses of that specific pool of loans.

Credit Quality Indicators.   Key credit quality indicators for mortgage loans include the migration of past due loans, non-accrual loans, and loans in process of foreclosure. The table below summarizes the FHLB's key credit quality indicators for mortgage loans. 
    
  Table 9.4 - Recorded Investment in Delinquent Mortgage Loans (dollars in thousands)

    Loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure (including past due or current loans in the process of foreclosure) expressed as a percentage of the total loan portfolio class recorded investment amount. 
              (3) 
    Each conventional loan past due 90 days or more still accruing interest is on a schedule/scheduled monthly settlement basis and contains one or more credit enhancements. Loans that are well secured and in the process of collection as a result of remaining credit enhancements and schedule/scheduled settlement are not placed on non-accrual status. 
       
  The FHLB did not have any real estate owned at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Troubled Debt Restructurings  . A troubled debt restructuring is considered to have occurred when a concession is granted to a borrower for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and that concession would not have been considered otherwise. The FHLB's troubled debt restructurings primarily involve loans where an agreement permits the recapitalization of past due amounts up to the original loan amount and certain loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A loan considered a troubled debt restructuring is individually evaluated for impairment when determining its related allowance for credit losses. Credit loss is measured by factoring in expected cash shortfalls as of the reporting date.  
    
  The FHLB's recorded investment in modified loans considered troubled debt restructurings was (in thousands)   $10,108   and   $9,385   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The amount of troubled debt restructurings is not considered material to the FHLB's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Note 10 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  Nature of Business Activity 
    
  The FHLB is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the effect of interest rate changes on its interest-earning assets and on the interest-bearing liabilities that finance these assets. The goal of the FHLB's interest-rate risk management strategy is not to eliminate interest-rate risk, but to manage it within appropriate limits. To mitigate the risk of loss, the FHLB has established policies and procedures, which include guidelines on the amount of exposure to interest rate changes it is willing to accept. In addition, the FHLB monitors the risk to its interest income, net interest margin and average maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. See Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities in the FHLB's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the FHLB's derivative transactions. 

22 

     Table of Contents  

The FHLB uses derivatives when they are considered to be the most cost-effective alternative to achieve the FHLB's financial and risk management objectives. The FHLB re-evaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques it uses or adopt new strategies. 
    
  The FHLB transacts its derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers. Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute Consolidated Obligations. Derivative transactions may be either executed with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives).  
    
  Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), the derivative transaction is novated and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse. The FHLB is not a derivative dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit.  
    
  Financial Statement Effect and Additional Financial Information 
    
  The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments or cash flows received and paid. The notional amount reflects the FHLB's involvement in the various classes of financial instruments and represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor the overall exposure of the FHLB to credit and market risk; the overall risk is much smaller. The risks of derivatives only can be measured meaningfully on a portfolio basis that takes into account the counterparties, the types of derivatives, the items being hedged and any offsets between the derivatives and the items being hedged.

  Credit Risk on Derivatives 
    
  Certain of the FHLB's uncleared derivative contracts contain provisions that require the FHLB to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is deterioration in the FHLB's credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) at   September 30, 2016   was (in thousands)   $39,253  , for which the FHLB had posted collateral with a fair value of (in thousands)   $22,168   in the normal course of business. 
    
  If one of the FHLB's credit ratings had been lowered to the next lower rating that would have triggered additional collateral to be delivered, the FHLB would have been required to deliver up to an additional (in thousands)   $190   of collateral at fair value to its derivatives counterparties at   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements and generally credit ratings are not factored into the initial margin. However, clearing agents may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades. At   September 30, 2016  , the FHLB was not required to post additional initial margin by its clearing agents based on credit considerations. 
    
  Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities 
    
  The FHLB presents derivative instruments, related cash collateral, including any initial and variation margin, received or pledged, and associated accrued interest, on a net basis by clearing agent and/or by counterparty when it has met the netting requirements. 
    
  Table 10.4 presents separately the fair value of derivative instruments meeting or not meeting netting requirements, including the related collateral received from or pledged to counterparties. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the FHLB did not receive or pledge any non-cash collateral. Any overcollateralization under an individual clearing agent and/or counterparty level is not included in the determination of the net unsecured amount.

Note 16 - Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans  
    
  Qualified Defined Benefit Multi-employer Plan.   The FHLB participates in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Under the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan, contributions made by one participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers because assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer. Also, in the event a participating employer is unable to meet its contribution requirements, the required contributions for the other participating employers could increase proportionately. The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan covers substantially all officers and employees of the FHLB who meet certain eligibility requirements. Contributions to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan charged to compensation and benefit expense were   $1,685,000   and   $1,500,000   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $  5,055,000   and $  4,478,000   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Qualified Defined Contribution Plan.   The FHLB also participates in the Pentegra Defined Contribution Plan for Financial Institutions, a tax-qualified, defined contribution pension plan. The FHLB contributes a percentage of the participants' compensation by making a matching contribution equal to a percentage of voluntary employee contributions, subject to certain limitations. The FHLB contributed   $193,000   and   $218,000   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $  817,000   and $  787,000   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Nonqualified Supplemental Defined Benefit Retirement Plan  . The FHLB maintains a nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit plan. The plan ensures that participants receive the full amount of benefits to which they would have been entitled under the qualified defined benefit plan in the absence of limits on benefit levels imposed by the IRS. There are no funded plan assets. The FHLB has established a grantor trust, which is included in held-to-maturity securities on the Statements of Condition, to meet future benefit obligations and current payments to beneficiaries. 
    
  Postretirement Benefits Plan  . The FHLB also sponsors a postretirement benefits plan that includes health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. Future retirees are eligible for the postretirement benefits plan if they were hired prior to August 1, 1990, are age 55 or older, and their age plus years of continuous service at retirement are greater than or equal to 80. Spouses are covered subject to required contributions. There are no funded plan assets that have been designated to provide postretirement benefits.

Note 18 - Fair Value Disclosures    
    
  The fair value amounts recorded on the Statements of Condition and presented in the related note disclosures have been determined by the FHLB using available market information and the FHLB's best judgment of appropriate valuation methods. The fair values reflect the FHLB's judgment of how a market participant would estimate the fair values.  
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy  . The FHLB records trading securities, available-for-sale securities, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, certain Advances and certain Consolidated Obligation Bonds at fair value on a recurring basis, and on occasion, certain mortgage loans held for portfolio on a nonrecurring basis. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of how market observable the fair value measurement is. An entity must disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified. 
    
  The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
    
  Level 1 Inputs   - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the reporting entity can access on the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2 Inputs   - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
    
  Level 3 Inputs   - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  
    
  The FHLB reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out at fair value as of the beginning of the quarter in which the changes occur. The FHLB did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

    The fair value information presented is as of the date the fair value adjustment was recorded during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
       
  Fair Value Option  . The fair value option provides an irrevocable option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value. It requires a company to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the Statements of Condition. Fair value is used for both the initial and subsequent measurement of the designated assets, liabilities and commitments, with the changes in fair value recognized in net income. If elected, interest income and interest expense on Advances and Consolidated Bonds carried at fair value are recognized based solely on the contractual amount of interest due or unpaid. Any transaction fees or costs are immediately recognized into other non-interest income or other non-interest expense.  
    
  The FHLB has elected the fair value option for certain financial instruments that either do not qualify for hedge accounting or may be at risk for not meeting hedge effectiveness requirements. These fair value elections were made primarily in an effort to mitigate the potential income statement volatility that can arise from economic hedging relationships in which the carrying value of the hedged item is not adjusted for changes in fair value.

For instruments recorded under the fair value option, the related contractual interest income and contractual interest expense are recorded as part of net interest income on the Statements of Income. The remaining changes in fair value for instruments in which the fair value option has been elected are recorded as  Net gains (losses) on financial instruments held under fair value option  in the Statements of Income. The FHLB has determined that no adjustments to the fair values of its instruments recorded under the fair value option for instrument-specific credit risk were necessary as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Legal Proceedings  . From time to time, the FHLB is subject to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In March 2010, the FHLB was advised by representatives of the Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. bankruptcy estate that they believed that the FHLB had been unjustly enriched in connection with the close out of its interest rate swap transactions with Lehman at the time of the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008 and that the bankruptcy estate was entitled to the $  43 million   difference between the settlement amount the FHLB paid Lehman in connection with the close-out transactions and the market value payment the FHLB received when replacing the swaps with other counterparties. In May 2010, the FHLB received a Derivatives Alternative Dispute Resolution notice from the Lehman bankruptcy estate with a settlement demand of $  65.8 million  , plus interest accruing primarily at LIBOR plus   14.5   percent since the bankruptcy filing, based on their view of how the settlement amount should have been calculated. In accordance with the Alternative Dispute Resolution Order of the Bankruptcy Court administering the Lehman estate, senior management of the FHLB participated in a non-binding mediation in New York in August 2010, and counsel for the FHLB continued discussions with the court-appointed mediator for several weeks thereafter. The mediation concluded in October 2010 without a settlement of the claims asserted by the Lehman bankruptcy estate. In April 2013, Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc., through Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the Plan Administrator under the Modified Third Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its Affiliated Debtors, filed an adversary complaint in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York against the FHLB seeking (a) a declaratory judgment on the interpretation of certain provisions and the calculation of amounts due under the agreement governing the 2008 swap transactions described above, and (b) additional amounts alleged as due as part of the termination of such transactions. The FHLB believes that it correctly calculated, and fully satisfied its obligation to Lehman in September 2008, and the FHLB intends to vigorously defend itself.  
    
  The FHLB also is subject to other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The FHLB would record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on the FHLB's financial condition or results of operations. 

Note 20 - Transactions with Other FHLBanks 
    
  The FHLB notes all transactions with other FHLBanks on the face of its financial statements. Occasionally, the FHLB loans short-term funds to and borrows short-term funds from other FHLBanks. These loans and borrowings are transacted at then current market rates when traded. There were no such loans or borrowings outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   and no such transactions occurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

In addition, the FHLB may, from time to time, assume the outstanding primary liability for Consolidated Obligations of another FHLBank (at then current market rates on the day when the transfer is traded) rather than issuing new debt for which the FHLB is the primary obligor. The FHLB then becomes the primary obligor on the transferred debt. There were   no   Consolidated Obligations transferred to the FHLB during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . The FHLB had   no   Consolidated Obligations transferred to other FHLBanks during these periods.

Note 21 - Transactions with Stockholders 
    
  As a cooperative, the FHLB's capital stock is owned by its members, by former members that retain the stock as provided in the FHLB's Capital Plan and by nonmember institutions that have acquired members and must retain the stock to support Advances or other activities with the FHLB. All Advances are issued to members and all mortgage loans held for portfolio are purchased from members. The FHLB also maintains demand deposit accounts for members, primarily to facilitate settlement activities that are directly related to Advances and mortgage loan purchases. Additionally, the FHLB may enter into interest rate swaps with its stockholders. The FHLB may not invest in any equity securities issued by its stockholders and it has not purchased any mortgage-backed securities securitized by, or other direct long-term investments in, its stockholders.  
    
  For financial statement purposes, the FHLB defines related parties as those members with more than 10 percent of the voting interests of the FHLB capital stock outstanding. Federal legislation prescribes the voting rights of members in the election of both member and independent directors. For member directorships, the Finance Agency designates the number of member directorships in a given year and an eligible voting member may vote only for candidates seeking election in its respective state. For independent directorships, the FHLB's Board of Directors nominates candidates to be placed on the ballot in an at-large election. For both member and independent directorship elections, a member is entitled to vote one share of required capital stock, subject to a statutory limitation, for each applicable directorship. Under this limitation, the total number of votes that a member may cast is limited to the average number of shares of the FHLB's capital stock that were required to be held by all members in that state as of the record date for voting. Nonmember stockholders are not eligible to vote in director elections. Due to the abovementioned statutory limitation, no member owned more than 10 percent of the voting interests of the FHLB at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  All transactions with stockholders are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Finance Agency regulations require the FHLB to offer the same pricing for Advances and other services to all members regardless of asset or transaction size, charter type, or geographic location. However, the FHLB may, in pricing its Advances, distinguish among members based upon its assessment of the credit and other risks to the FHLB of lending to any particular member or upon other reasonable criteria that may be applied equally to all members. The FHLB's policies and procedures require that such standards and criteria be applied consistently and without discrimination to all members applying for Advances. 
    
  Transactions with Directors' Financial Institutions.   In the ordinary course of its business, the FHLB may provide products and services to members whose officers or directors serve as directors of the FHLB (Directors' Financial Institutions). Finance Agency regulations require that transactions with Directors' Financial Institutions be made on the same terms as those with any other member. The following table reflects balances with Directors' Financial Institutions for the items indicated below. The FHLB had no mortgage-backed securities or derivatives transactions with Directors' Financial Institutions at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Nonmember Affiliates.   The FHLB has relationships with   three   nonmember affiliates, the Kentucky Housing Corporation, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency and the Tennessee Housing Development Agency. The FHLB had   no   investments in or borrowings to any of these nonmember affiliates at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The FHLB has executed standby bond purchase agreements with one state housing authority whereby the FHLB, for a fee, agrees as a liquidity provider if required, to purchase and hold the authority's bonds until the designated marketing agent can find a suitable investor or the housing authority repurchases the bond according to a schedule established by the standby agreement. During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , the FHLB was not required to purchase any bonds under these agreements.

Financial Condition 
    
  Mission Asset Activity 
  The following table summarizes our financial condition. 

In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the FHLB fulfilled its mission by providing readily available and competitively priced wholesale funding to its member financial institutions, supporting its commitment to affordable housing, and paying stockholders a competitive dividend return on their capital investment.  
    
  The balance of Mission Asset Activity   which we define as Advances, Letters of Credit, and total MPP (including purchase commitments)   was   $94.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $6.2 billion   (  six percent  ) from year-end   2015  . This change was primarily driven by a decrease in the balances of Advances and Letters of Credit. Advance balances decreased   $4.4 billion   (  six percent  ) primarily due to a reduction in borrowings from a few large-asset members along with captive insurance companies, who were required to pay off their Advances due to the final membership ruling issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency) in January 2016. However, the MPP principal balance rose   $0.8 billion   (  11 percent  ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , members funded on average   3.1 percent   of their assets with Advances, and the market penetration rate was relatively stable with over 65 percent of members holding Mission Asset Activity. As in the last several years, most members continued to have modest demand for new Advance borrowings due to measured economic growth, an abundance of deposits, significant amounts of liquidity made available as a result of the actions of the Federal Reserve System, and competition for Advances from other sources of wholesale funds. 
    
  The growth in the MPP reflected our strategy to increase this segment as well as the impact of low mortgage rates. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we purchased   $2.0 billion   of mortgage loans, while principal reductions totaled $1.2 billion. Residual credit risk exposure in the mortgage loan portfolio continued to be minimal.  
    
  Based on earnings in the first   nine   months of   2016  , we accrued   $18 million   for the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) pool of funds to be available to members in 2017. In addition, we continued our voluntary sponsorship of two other housing programs, which provide resources to pay for accessibility rehabilitation and emergency repairs for special needs and elderly homeowners and to help members aid their communities following natural disasters. 
    
  Investments and Other Assets 
  The balance of investments at   September 30, 2016   was   $23.6 billion  ,   a decrease   of   $13.7 billion   (  37 percent  ) from year-end   2015  . Most of the reduction was driven by a decline in short-term investments used for asset liquidity, for which we carried a substantially larger than normal balance at the end of 2015. At   September 30, 2016  , investments included   $15.1 billion   of mortgage-backed securities and   $8.5 billion   of other investments, which were mostly short-term instruments held for liquidity. All of our mortgage-backed securities held at   September 30, 2016   were issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a U.S. agency.  

45 

     Table of Contents  

Investment balances averaged   $28.1 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $2.8 billion   (  11 percent  ) from the average balance during the same period of   2015  . This primarily reflected an increase in average liquidity investments between these two periods. We maintained an adequate amount of asset liquidity throughout the first   nine   months of   2016   under a variety of liquidity measures as discussed in the "Liquidity Risk" section of "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management." 
    
  Capital 
  Capital adequacy remained strong in the first   nine   months of   2016  , surpassing all minimum regulatory capital requirements. The GAAP capital-to-assets ratio at   September 30, 2016   was   4.84 percent  , while the regulatory capital-to-assets ratio was   5.01 percent  . Both ratios exceeded the regulatory required minimum of four percent. Regulatory capital includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock accounted for as a liability under GAAP. The amounts of GAAP and regulatory capital   decreased     $271 million   and $141 million, respectively, in the first   nine   months of   2016  , due primarily to repurchases of certain members' excess capital stock. 
    
  Total retained earnings were   $799 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $34 million   (  four percent  ) from year-end   2015  . We believe the amount of retained earnings is sufficient to protect against members' impairment risk of their capital stock investment in the FHLB and to provide the opportunity to stabilize or augment future dividends, if needed. Our capital policies also have safeguards to prevent financial leverage ratios from falling below regulatory minimum levels.  
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  Overall Results 
  The table below summarizes our results of operations. 

In the three- and nine-months comparison periods, net income decreased   $4 million   (  six percent  ) and   $24 million   (  13 percent  ), respectively. The reduction in net income in both comparison periods was primarily driven by unrealized losses related to derivatives, hedged items and other financial instruments carried at fair value in the 2016 periods compared to unrealized gains on these items in 2015. The volatility created by these fair value fluctuations is not expected to result in realized gains or losses because we typically hold the associated instruments to maturity. The lower net income in both comparison periods was also the result of higher net amortization of premiums paid on mortgage assets in response to lower long-term rates. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in the other components of net interest income, which was driven in large part by growth in mission assets and favorable funding of LIBOR-indexed assets. 
    
  We believe that our financial condition will continue to generate steady profitability, reflecting the combination of a stable business and interest rate environment, favorable spreads on interest-earnings assets, a relatively constant composition of assets, a consistent and conservative management of risk, a moderate increase in operating expenses, and a prudent economic use of derivative transactions. Additionally, our business model is structured to be able to absorb sharp changes in Mission Asset Activity because we can undertake commensurate reductions in liability balances and capital. Factors that can cause significant periodic earnings volatility are currently related to recognition of net amortization and unrealized fair value adjustments. 
    
  Consistent with experience over the last eight years, ROE was significantly above short-term rates, while we maintained risk exposures in line with our moderate to low-risk tolerance levels. The spread between ROE and 3-month LIBOR is a market benchmark we believe member stockholders use to assess the competitiveness of the return on their capital investment in our company. Earnings levels continued to represent competitive returns on stockholders' capital investment.   
  
    46 

     Table of Contents  

In September 2016, we paid stockholders a quarterly 4.00 percent annualized dividend rate on their capital investment in our company. This is the same rate we have distributed in each of the last 12 quarters. 
    
  Effect of Interest Rate Environment 
  Trends in market interest rates strongly influence the results of operations and profitability via how they affect members' demand for Mission Asset Activity, spreads on assets, funding costs and decisions in managing the tradeoffs in our market risk/return profile. The following table presents key market interest rates (obtained from Bloomberg L.P.). 

(1) 
    Simple average of current coupon rates of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac par mortgage-backed security indications. 

The continued low interest rate environment in the first   nine   months of   2016   moderately benefited trends in the overall results of operations relative to the level of interest rates. Because the low rate environment has persisted for nearly a decade, much of the benefit has diminished over time as many assets and liabilities have fully repriced to the low rates. However, results of operations continue to benefit from a lack of sharp changes in interest rates, especially upward movements. Average and period end long-term rates were lower in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 and compared to the end of 2015. Shorter-term rates had little movement from year-end 2015. We expect these recent rate movements to have only a modest effect on results of operations and profitability, outside of temporary fluctuations from net amortization and unrealized fair value adjustments. 
    
  Effect of Economy and Financial Markets on Mission Asset Activity  
    
  In the last several years, the percentage of assets that members funded with Advances showed little variation, in the range of three to four percent. We would expect to see a broad-based increase in Advance demand when the economy experiences an improved growth trend, when interest rates begin to increase over time, or if changes in Federal Reserve policy reduce other sources of liquidity available to members.  
    
  The relative balance between loan and deposit fluctuations can provide an indication of potential member Advance demand. From June 30, 2015 to   June 30, 2016   (the most recent period for which data are available), aggregate loan portfolios of Fifth District depository institutions grew   $130.4 billion   (  9.8 percent  ) while their aggregate deposit balances rose   $119.9 billion   (  5.7 percent  ). Most of the loan and deposit growth in this period occurred from our largest members, which is consistent with the concentration of nationwide financial activity.  
    
  Excluding the   five   members that have over $50 billion of assets, aggregate loans increased   $17.9 billion   (  8.7 percent  ) in the 12-month period while aggregate deposits grew by   $15.6 billion   (  6.4 percent  ). This relative balance of loan and deposit growth contributed to the small fluctuation in Advance balances from most members.

Business Outlook and Risk Management 
    
  Our major business strategies, outlook for our business, and risk profiles and management have not changed substantially since our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management  provides details on current risk exposures. We have no material updates to provide for the regulatory or legislative environment since the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Mission Asset Activity 
    
  Mission Assets are the primary means by which we fulfill our mission with direct connections to members. We regularly monitor our balance sheet concentration of Mission Asset Activity. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , our Primary Mission Asset ratio, which measures the sum of average Advances and mortgage loans as a percentage of average Consolidated Obligations, was   78   percent. This ratio exceeded the Finance Agency's preferred ratio of 70 percent. In assessing overall mission achievement, we also consider supplemental sources of Mission Asset Activity, the most significant of which is Letters of Credit issued to members. 
    
  Credit Services 
    
  Credit Activity and Advance Composition 
  The table below shows trends in Advance balances by major programs and in the notional amount of Letters of Credit.  

(1) 
    As a percentage of total Advances principal.     
              (2) 
    Excludes Putable Advances where the related put options have expired. Such Advances are classified based on their current terms. 
       
  REPO Advances, which drove the majority of the fluctuation in Advance balances in the noted periods, typically represent our most volatile Advance product from quarter-to-quarter because of their short-term maturities. 
    
  Members   reduced   their available lines in the Letters of Credit program by   $2.8 billion   (  14 percent  ) from year-end 2015 to   September 30, 2016  . Letters of Credit balances averaged   $17.1 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $0.2 billion   (  one percent  ) from the average balance during the same period in   2015  . We normally earn fees on Letters of Credit based on the actual average amount of the Letters utilized, which generally is less than the notional amount issued.

     Table of Contents  

Advance Usage 
  In addition to analyzing Advance balances by dollar trends and the number of members utilizing them, we monitor the degree to which members use Advances to fund their balance sheets. The following table shows the unweighted, average ratio of each member's Advance balance to its most-recently available figures for total assets.  

Advance usage ratios were lower at   September 30, 2016   compared with   December 31, 2015  , driven largely by the continued modest demand for Advances and the substantial pay off and non-renewal of short-term borrowings from captive insurance company members as required by the Finance Agency's 2016 final rule on membership requirements. 

The following tables present principal balances for the five members with the largest Advance borrowings.  

(1)  
    Captive insurance company member. 
       
  Advance concentration ratios are influenced by, and generally similar to, concentration ratios of financial activity among our Fifth District financial institutions. We believe that having large financial institutions that actively use our Mission Asset Activity augments the value of membership to all members. For example, such activity improves our operating efficiency, increases our earnings and thereby contributions to housing and community investment programs, may enable us over time to obtain more favorable funding costs, and helps us maintain competitively priced Mission Asset Activity.  
    
  Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio (Mortgage Purchase Program, or "MPP") 
    
  The table below shows principal purchases and reductions of loans in the MPP for the first   nine   months of   2016  . 

The   increase   in principal loan balances in   2016   reflected our strategy to grow this segment. Most of the higher principal resulted from activity with our two largest sellers who drive program balances. In the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   96   members sold us mortgage loans, with the number of monthly sellers averaging   66  . All loans acquired in the first three quarters of   2016   were conventional loans.                                 

49 

     Table of Contents  

We closely track the refinancing incentives of our mortgage assets (including loans in the MPP and mortgage-backed securities) because the option for homeowners to change their principal payments normally represents the largest portion of our market risk exposure and can affect MPP balances. MPP principal paydowns in the first   nine   months of   2016   equated to a   14   percent annual constant prepayment rate, equal to the   14   percent rate for all of   2015  . However, reductions in mortgage rates that occurred in the first nine months of 2016 accelerated prepayment speeds in the third quarter to an annualized rate of 17 percent. We expect the recent trend of faster prepayments to continue in the remainder of 2016 unless mortgage rates rise. 
    
  The MPP's composition of balances by loan type, original final maturity, and weighted-average mortgage note rate did not change materially in the first   nine   months of   2016  . The weighted average mortgage note rate fell from   4.14   percent at the end of   2015   to   4.02   percent at   September 30, 2016  . This decline reflected a continuing trend of prepayments of higher rate mortgages and purchases of lower rate mortgages. MPP yields earned in   2016  , after consideration of funding and hedging costs, continued to offer favorable returns relative to their market risk exposure. 
    
  Investments 
    
  The table below presents the ending and average balances of the investment portfolio. 

(1) 
    The average balance includes the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end. 
       
  We continued to maintain an ample amount of asset liquidity. Liquidity investment levels can vary significantly based on liquidity needs, the availability of acceptable net spreads, the number of eligible counterparties that meet our unsecured credit risk criteria, and changes in the amount of Mission Assets. It is normal for liquidity investments to vary by up to several billion dollars on a daily basis. Leading up to year-end   2015  , certain dealers, who play a large role in facilitating the distribution of FHLBank System debt to investors, were more reluctant to expand the amount of System debt on their balance sheets over year-end due to the perceived growing burden of their regulatory environment. Because of this, we conservatively carried a larger amount of liquidity to satisfy any potential member borrowing needs during a period where accessing additional liquidity may have been more challenging. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we reduced liquidity investments to historical levels, ending the quarter at   $8.5 billion  . Although certain dealers continue to have some reluctance to expand the amount of System debt on their balance sheets at quarter ends, our change in mix of shorter-term funding, as discussed below, has contributed to our decision to reduce the levels of liquidity investments. 
    
  Our overarching strategy for mortgage-backed securities is to keep holdings as close as possible to the regulatory maximum of three times regulatory capital, subject to the availability of securities that we believe provide acceptable risk/return tradeoffs. The ratio of mortgage-backed securities to regulatory capital was   2.97   at   September 30, 2016  . The balance of mortgage-backed securities at   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $11.7 billion   of securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (of which   $3.1 billion   were floating-rate securities),   $0.8 billion   of floating-rate securities issued by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and   $2.6 billion   of securities issued by Ginnie Mae (which are primarily fixed rate). We held no private-label mortgage-backed securities.  
  The table below shows principal purchases and paydowns of our mortgage-backed securities for the first   nine   months of   2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Principal paydowns in the first   nine   months of   2016   equated to a   17 percent   annual constant prepayment rate, similar to the   16 percent   rate in   2015  .  
    
  Consolidated Obligations  
    
  The table below presents the ending and average balances of our participations in Consolidated Obligations. 

(1) 
    Includes unamortized premiums/discounts, fair value option valuation adjustments, hedging and other basis adjustments. 
        
  We fund LIBOR-indexed assets with Discount Notes, adjustable-rate Bonds, and swapped fixed-rate Bonds because they give us the ability to effectively match the LIBOR reset periods embedded in these assets. In the second half of 2015, we shifted the composition of this funding more towards Discount Notes, which provided lower funding costs and was in response to growth in Advance balances and liquidity investments. However, during the first   nine   months of   2016  , we began shifting the composition of shorter-term funding away from Discount Notes towards adjustable-rate and swapped fixed-rate Bonds, which normally have longer maturities than Discount Notes. We are taking these actions in order to return our funding composition over time to historical levels, which will lower our exposure to basis risk and unexpected liquidity risk. This change in funding composition, which may increase our funding costs, also reduces the income benefits associated with the historically favorable spreads between LIBOR-indexed assets and interest paid on Discount Notes.  
    
  The composition of unswapped fixed-rate Bonds, which typically have initial maturities greater than one year, was relatively stable in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   2015  .  

Deposits 
    
  Total deposits with us are normally a relatively minor source of low-cost funding. Total interest bearing deposits at   September 30, 2016   were   $0.8 billion  ,   a decrease   of   six percent   from year-end   2015  . The average balance of total interest bearing deposits in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $0.8 billion  , similar to the average balance during the same period of   2015  .

Capital Resources 
    
  The following tables present capital amounts and capital-to-assets ratios, on both a GAAP and regulatory basis. 

Both GAAP and regulatory capital-to-assets ratios remained above the regulatory required minimum of four percent. We consider the regulatory ratio to be a better representation of financial leverage than the GAAP ratio because, although the GAAP ratio treats mandatorily redeemable capital stock as a liability, it protects investors in our debt in the same manner as GAAP capital stock and retained earnings. 

A portion of capital stock is excess, meaning it is not required as a condition to being a member and not required to capitalize Mission Asset Activity. Excess capital stock provides a base of capital to manage financial leverage at prudent levels, augments loss protections for bondholders, and capitalizes a portion of growth in Mission Assets. The amount of excess capital stock, as defined by our Capital Plan, was   $381 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which was within our preferred range of $200 million to $700 million. 
    
  Membership and Stockholders 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we added nine new member stockholders and lost 16 members, ending the quarter at   692   member stockholders. Eleven of the members lost merged with other Fifth District members and, therefore, the impact on our earnings and Mission Asset Activity was small. 
    
  The Finance Agency issued a final rule on FHLBank membership in January 2016. This rule imposes new membership requirements and eliminates captive insurance companies from FHLBank membership. The rule also requires that certain captive insurance companies, which represented 15 members totaling $6.6 billion in Advances at December 31, 2015, pay off existing Advances by February 2017 and cease any new borrowings. Remaining Advances to these members totaled $0.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. The subsequent loss of this membership segment will not significantly affect our financial condition or results of operations.

  Components of Earnings and Return on Equity 
    
  The following table is a summary income statement for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Each ROE percentage is computed by dividing income or expense for the category by the average amount of stockholders' equity for the period. 

(1) 
    The ROE amounts have been computed using dollars in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts (millions) in this table may produce nominally different results. 
       
  Details on the individual factors contributing to the level and changes in profitability are explained in the sections below.

Net Interest Income 
  Components of Net Interest Income 
  The following table shows the major components of net interest income. Reasons for the variance in net interest income between the periods are discussed below. 

(1) 
    Includes (amortization)/accretion of premiums/discounts on mortgage assets and Consolidated Obligations and deferred transaction costs (concession fees) for Consolidated Obligations. 
              (2) 
    These components of net interest rate spread have been segregated to display their relative impact. 
              (3) 
    Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets. 
       
  Net Amortization/Accretion:   Net amortization/accretion (generally referred to as "amortization") includes monthly recognition of premiums and discounts paid on purchases of mortgage assets, as well as premiums, discounts and concessions paid on Consolidated Obligations. Periodic amortization adjustments do not necessarily indicate a trend in economic return over the entire life of mortgage assets, although it is one component of lifetime economic returns.  
    
  Amortization increased substantially in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily because of an acceleration in actual and projected prepayment speeds as long-term interest rates generally declined during the first three quarters of 2016.  
    
  Prepayment Fees on Advances:   Fees for members' early repayment of certain Advances are designed to make us economically indifferent to whether members hold Advances to maturity or repay them before maturity. Advance prepayment fees increased in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to the prepayment of Advances related to an in-district merger in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  Other Components of Net Interest Rate Spread:   Excluding net amortization and prepayment fees, the total other components of net interest rate spread   increased     $11 million   and   $29 million   in the three- and   nine  -months comparison periods, respectively. The following factors accounted for the changes in other components of net interest rate spread. 
    
  Nine-Months Comparison 
             
    Growth in Mission Assets-  Favorable  :   Higher balances of Mission Assets increased net interest income by an estimated $10 million. This was comprised of $1 million from a   $0.4 billion   increase in average Advance balances and $9 million from a   $0.9 billion   increase in average MPP balances.  
                
    Funding of LIBOR-indexed assets-  Favorable  :   Net interest income on LIBOR-indexed assets increased by an estimated $13 million primarily because yields on adjustable-rate LIBOR-indexed assets rose by more than Discount Note rates. This was partially offset by an increase in the cost of adjustable-rate Bonds relative to LIBOR. 
                
    Lower spreads on MPP loans-  Unfavorable  :   A decline in the spread earned on mortgage loans decreased net interest income by an estimated $1 million. The decrease was primarily due to the continued paydown of higher-yielding mortgage assets and low-cost debt. However, this was partially offset by the decision to call and replace debt at lower rates driven by declines in long-term interest rates. 
     
    54 

     Table of Contents  

Higher spreads on mortgage-backed securities-  Favorable  :   Higher spreads earned on mortgage-backed securities increased net interest income by an estimated $5 million. The increase was driven by purchases of new mortgage-backed securities at favorable spreads and was partially offset by the paydown of higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities. 
                
    Higher balances of mortgage-backed securities-  Favorable  :   The average balance of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio rose   $0.6 billion  , which increased net interest income by an estimated $2 million. 
     Three-Months Comparison 
             
    Growth in Mission Assets-  Favorable  :   Higher balances of Mission Assets increased net interest income by an estimated $1 million. This was due to an increase of $2 million from a   $0.8 billion     increase   in average MPP balances, which was partially offset by a decrease of $1 million from a   $2.5 billion     decrease   in average Advance balances.  
                
    Funding of LIBOR-indexed assets-  Favorable  :   Net interest income increased by an estimated $5 million primarily because yields on adjustable-rate LIBOR-indexed assets rose more than Discount Note rates, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average amount of LIBOR-indexed assets funded by lower-cost Discount Notes. 
                
    Higher spreads on MPP loans-  Favorable  :   An increase in the spread earned on mortgage loans increased net interest income by an estimated $2 million. The increase was primarily due to the decision to call and replace debt at lower rates driven by declines in long-term interest rates. 
                
    Lower spreads on mortgage-backed securities-  Unfavorable  :   Lower spreads earned on mortgage-backed securities decreased net interest income by an estimated $1 million. The decrease was driven by the paydown of higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities in the third quarter of 2016. 
                
    Funding of fixed-rate mortgage assets-  Favorable  :   An increase in the amount of lower-cost short-term debt that we use to fund longer-term fixed-rate mortgages increased net interest income by an estimated $4 million. 
       
  Earnings from Capital:   The earnings from funding assets with interest-free capital   increased     $3 million   and   $9 million   in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015   due to modestly higher short-term interest rates following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term rates in December 2015.

Average Balance Sheet and Rates 
  The following tables provide average balances and rates for major balance sheet accounts, which determine the changes in the net interest rate spread. All data include the impact of interest rate swaps, which we allocate to each asset and liability category according to their designated hedging relationship.  

(1) 
    Amounts used to calculate average rates are based on dollars in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts (millions) may not produce the same results. 
              (2) 
    Non-accrual loans are included in average balances used to determine average rate. 
              (3) 
    Includes certificates of deposit and bank notes that are classified as available-for-sale securities. 
              (4) 
    Includes available-for-sale securities based on their amortized costs. The yield information does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of stockholders' equity for available-for-sale securities. 
              (5) 
    The average balance amounts include the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end. 
              (6) 
    Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets.

  The net interest rate spread and net interest margin were similar in the nine-months comparison period because the increase in other components of net interest rate spread, as discussed in the previous section, mostly offset the increase in net amortization. 
    
  The net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased in the three-months comparison period because of the net increase in other components of net interest rate spread, as discussed in the previous section.

Rates on shorter-term interest-earning assets (short-term Advances, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, and interest-bearing deposits in banks) rose in the three and   nine   months ended September 30,   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   following the increase in the Federal funds target rate in December 2015. However, long-term rates fell period-over-period resulting in a net average rate   increase   in total interest-earning assets of only 0.26 percentage points and   0.21   percentage points in the three and nine-months comparison, respectively. 
    
  The increase in average rates on total interest-bearing liabilities was driven by higher rates on shorter-term liabilities that reset similar to short-term assets. 
    
  Volume/Rate Analysis 
  Changes in both average balances (volume) and interest rates influence changes in net interest income. The following table summarizes these changes and trends in interest income and interest expense. 

(1) 
    Volume changes are calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the prior year rate. 
              (2) 
    Rate changes are calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the prior year average balance. 
              (3) 
    Changes that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather are equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes.

Effect of the Use of Derivatives on Net Interest Income 
  The following table shows the effect of using derivatives on net interest income. The effect on earnings from other components of derivatives, including market value adjustments, is provided in  Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense.  

Most of our use of derivatives synthetically convert the intermediate- and long-term fixed interest rates on certain Advances and Bonds to adjustable-coupon rates tied to short-term LIBOR (mostly one- and three-month repricing resets). These adjustable-rate coupons normally carry lower interest rates than the fixed-rates. The use of derivatives lowered net interest income in each period primarily because the Advances that were swapped to short-term LIBOR had higher fixed interest rates than the Bonds that were swapped to short-term LIBOR. We accepted this reduction in earnings because it enabled us, by design, to significantly lower market risk exposure by creating a much closer match of actual cash flows between assets and liabilities than would occur otherwise.  
    
  Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense 
    
  The following table presents non-interest income and non-interest expense for each of the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Non-interest income decreased in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to unrealized losses from changes in market values on certain Consolidated Obligations held at fair value, net of unrealized market value gains on derivatives used to hedge the Obligations, as presented in the table below. Non-interest income also decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to unrealized losses from changes in the market value of derivatives, net of unrealized market value gains on certain Consolidated Obligations held at fair value.  
    
  Non-interest expense increased in the   nine   months ended September 30,   2016   primarily due to higher operating expenses, driven by legal fees, and other non-interest expense, the latter of which resulted primarily from an increase in the recognition of issuance costs (concession fees) on Consolidated Obligations held at fair value.

  The total amount of income volatility in derivatives and hedging activities was moderate compared to the notional principal amounts and consistent with the close hedging relationships of our derivative transactions. Income volatility in derivatives and hedging activities primarily represents unrealized fair value gains and losses. The volatility created by these fair value fluctuations is not expected to result in material realized gains or losses since we typically hold the associated instruments to maturity.

Segment Information 
    
  Note 17   of the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements presents information on our two operating business segments. We manage financial operations and market risk exposure primarily at the macro level, and within the context of the entire balance sheet, rather than exclusively at the level of individual segments. Under this approach, the market risk/return profile of each segment may not match, or possibly even have the same trends as, what would occur if we managed each segment on a stand-alone basis. The tables below summarize each segment's operating results for the periods shown.

    Amounts used to calculate returns are based on numbers in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts (millions) may not produce the same results. 
       
  Traditional Member Finance Segment 
  The decrease in net income in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , was due primarily to the unrealized losses from changes in market values on certain Consolidated Obligations held at fair value, as explained above.  
  
    61 

     Table of Contents  

This factor was partially offset by higher balances and spreads earned on Advances and mortgage-backed securities. The wider spreads earned on Advances were primarily due to higher LIBOR rates relative to Discount Note rates.  
    
  The decrease in net income in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , was due primarily to unrealized losses from changes in the market value of derivatives, net of gains from Consolidated Obligations held at fair value. This unfavorable factor was mostly offset by higher Advance prepayment fees and an increase in spreads earned on Advances, which was driven by higher LIBOR rates relative to Discount Note rates. 
    
  MPP Segment 
  The MPP continued to earn a substantial level of profitability compared to market interest rates, with a moderate amount of market risk and small amount of credit risk. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the MPP averaged   eight percent   of total average assets while accounting for   16 percent   of earnings. Net income and ROE declined in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due primarily to the increased amortization of purchased mortgage premiums as a result of lower long-term interest rates. Secondarily, profitability decreased due to the continued paydown of higher-yielding mortgage loans and low-cost debt. Additionally for the three-months comparison, profitability decreased due to market value losses on derivatives associated with hedging MPP commitments as compared to market value gains on these derivatives in the previous comparison period. In both comparison periods, these unfavorable factors were partially offset by growth in MPP balances and the decision to call and replace debt at lower rates driven by declines in long-term interest rates.    

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT 
    
  Market Risk  
    
  Market Value of Equity and Duration of Equity - Entire Balance Sheet 
  Two key measures of long-term market risk exposure are the sensitivities of the market value of equity and the duration of equity to changes in interest rates and other variables, as presented in the following tables for various instantaneous and permanent interest rate shocks (in basis points). We compiled average results using data for each month end. Given the current very low level of rates, the down rate shocks are nonparallel scenarios, with short-term rates decreasing less than long-term rates such that no rate falls below zero. 
    
  Market Value of Equity 

62 

     Table of Contents  

Duration of Equity 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , as in   2015  , consistent with our historical practice and risk appetite, we positioned market risk exposure to changing interest rates at a moderate level and well within our policy limits. The dollar amount of equity exposure for any individual rate shock can be obtained by multiplying the percentage change of the market value of equity by the amount of total capital.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the duration of equity measured in the down 200 basis point interest rate shock was materially higher relative to year-end   2015  . The key driver of the change was an enhancement we made to our model in the second quarter of 2016 to floor rates at zero consistent with our other market risk measures. The durations of equity provide an estimate of the change in market value of equity for a 1.00 percentage point further change in interest rates from the rate shock level. 
    
  Based on the totality of our risk analysis, we expect that profitability, defined as the level of ROE compared with short-term market rates, will remain competitive unless interest rates change by extremely large amounts in a short period of time. Decreases in long-term interest rates even up to two percentage points (which would put fixed-rate mortgages below two percent) would still result in profitability being well above market interest rates. Similarly, we believe that profitability would not become uncompetitive in a rising rate environment unless long-term rates were to permanently increase in a short period of time by five percentage points or more, combined with short-term rates increasing to at least seven percent.  
    
  Market Risk Exposure of the Mortgage Assets Portfolio 
  The mortgage assets portfolio normally accounts for almost all market risk exposure because of prepayment volatility that we cannot completely hedge while maintaining sufficient net spreads. Sensitivities of the market value of equity allocated to the mortgage assets portfolio under interest rate shocks (in basis points) are shown below. At   September 30, 2016  , the mortgage assets portfolio had an assumed capital allocation of $1.2 billion based on the entire balance sheet's regulatory capital-to-assets ratio. Average results are compiled using data for each month-end. The market value sensitivities are one measure we use to analyze the portfolio's estimated market risk exposure. 
    
  % Change in Market Value of Equity-Mortgage Assets Portfolio 

The risk exposure of the mortgage assets portfolio to higher interest rates was lower in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   2015  , driven primarily by the low level of current market rates. We believe the mortgage assets portfolio continued to have an acceptable amount of market risk exposure relative to its actual and expected profitability and consistent with our risk appetite philosophy. 
  
    63 

     Table of Contents  

Capital Adequacy  
    
  Retained Earnings 
  We must hold sufficient capital to protect against exposure to various risks, including market, credit, and operational. We regularly conduct a variety of measurements and assessments for capital adequacy. Our capital management policy sets forth a range of $350 million to $575 million as the minimum amount of retained earnings we believe is necessary to mitigate impairment risk from market risk exposure and to provide for dividend stability from factors that could cause earnings to be volatile. At   September 30, 2016  , the   $799 million   of retained earnings was comprised of $557 million unrestricted (  an increase   of $1 million from year-end   2015  ) and   $242 million   restricted (  an increase   of $33 million from year-end   2015  ), which by the FHLBank System's Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement we are not permitted to distribute as dividends.  
    
  We believe that the current amount of retained earnings is sufficient to mitigate members' impairment risk of their capital stock investment and to provide the opportunity to stabilize dividends when profitability may be volatile. However, due to the regulatory environment and employing an abundance of caution, we will continue to carry a greater amount of retained earnings than required by the policy and will continue to bolster capital adequacy over time by allocating a portion of earnings to the restricted retained earnings account.  

Market Capitalization Ratios 
  We measure two sets of market capitalization ratios. One measures the market value of equity (i.e., total capital) relative to the par value of regulatory capital stock (which is GAAP capital stock and mandatorily redeemable capital stock). The other measures the market value of total capital relative to the book value of total capital, which includes all components of capital. The measures provide a point-in-time indication of the FHLB's liquidation or franchise value and can also serve as a measure of realized or potential market risk exposure. 
    
  The following table presents the market value of equity to regulatory capital stock (excluding retained earnings) for several interest rate environments.   

A base case value below par could indicate that, in the remote event of an immediate liquidation scenario involving redemption of all capital stock, capital stock may be returned to stockholders at a value below par. This could be due to experiencing risks that lower the market value of capital and/or to having an insufficient amount of retained earnings. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the market capitalization ratios in the scenarios presented continued to be above the minimum policy limits. The base case ratio increased modestly at   September 30, 2016   compared to the end of   2015  , and remains acceptable because retained earnings were   19 percent   of regulatory capital stock at   September 30, 2016   and we maintained risk exposures at moderate levels.  
    
  The following table presents the market value of equity to the book value of total capital.

    Capital includes total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
       
    64 

     Table of Contents  

A base-case value below par indicates that we have realized or could realize risks (especially market risk) such that the market value of total capital owned by stockholders, which includes regulatory capital stock and retained earnings, is below par value (i.e., below 100 percent of the total book value). The base-case ratio of   97 percent   at   September 30, 2016   indicates that the market value of total capital is   $181 million   below the par value of total capital. In a scenario in which interest rates increase 200 basis points, the market value of total capital would be   $342 million   below the par value of total capital, which indicates that capital stock would still be redeemable at par but stockholders would not receive the full sum of their ownership claims in the FHLB which include both capital stock and retained earnings. 

Credit Risk 
    
  Overview 
  Our business entails a significant amount of inherent credit risk exposure. We believe our risk management practices, discussed below, bring the amount of residual credit risk to a minimal level. We have no loan loss reserves or impairment recorded for Credit Services, investments, and derivatives and a minimal amount of legacy credit risk exposure to the MPP.   
    
  Credit Services 
  Overview:   We have policies and practices to manage credit risk exposure from our secured lending activities, which include Advances and Letters of Credit. The objective of our credit risk management is to equalize risk exposure across members and counterparties to a zero level of expected losses, consistent with our conservative risk management principles and desire to have virtually no residual credit risk related to member borrowings.  
    
  Collateral:   We require each member to provide us a security interest in eligible collateral before it can undertake any secured borrowing. Eligible collateral includes single-family loans, multi-family loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial real estate, bond securities and farm real estate. The estimated value of pledged collateral is discounted in order to offset market, credit and liquidity risks that may affect the collateral's realizable value if it must be liquidated. Over-collateralization by one member is not applied to another member. At   September 30, 2016  , our policy of over-collateralization resulted in total collateral pledged of   $314.9 billion   to serve total borrowing capacity of   $270.0 billion  . The collateral composition remained relatively stable compared to the end of   2015  . 
    
  Borrowing Capacity/Lendable Value:   We determine borrowing capacity against pledged collateral by establishing minimum levels of over-collateralization (Collateralized Maintenance Requirements or CMRs). CMRs result in a lendable value, or borrowing capacity, that is less than the amount of pledged collateral. 
    
  CMRs are determined by statistical analysis and management assumptions relating to historical price volatility, inherent credit risks, liquidation timing and costs, and the current credit and economic environment. We apply CMR results to the estimated values of pledged assets. CMRs vary among pledged assets and members based on the financial strength of the member institution, the level of collateral status, the issuer of bond collateral or the quality of securitized assets, the marketability of the pledged assets, the payment performance of pledged loan collateral, and the quality of loan collateral as reflected in the manner in which it was underwritten and is administered. In August 2016, we updated CMRs resulting in relatively minor changes in borrowing capacity for most members. 
    
  Internal Credit Ratings:   We perform credit underwriting of our member and nonmember borrowers and assign them an internal credit rating. The credit ratings are based on internal credit analysis and consideration of available credit ratings from independent credit rating organizations. The credit ratings are used in conjunction with other measures of the credit risk and pledged collateral, as described above, in managing credit risk exposure to member and nonmember borrowers. 
    
  Member Failures, Closures, and Receiverships:   There was one member failure in   2016   through the date of this filing. We had no outstanding exposure to this institution. 
    
  MPP 
  Overview:   We believe that the residual amount of credit risk exposure to loans in the MPP is minimal, based on the same factors described in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe, based on our analysis, that future credit losses will not harm capital adequacy and will not significantly affect profitability except under the most extreme and unlikely credit conditions. 
    
  Conventional Loan Portfolio Characteristics:     The levels of loan-to-value ratios have improved over the last several years, consistent with the portfolio's excellent credit quality. The positive trends reflect the sustained recovery and improvement in the  
  
    65 

     Table of Contents  

overall housing market. At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average loan-to-value ratios for conventional loans based on origination values and estimated current values were   73 percent   and   62 percent  , respectively. These ratios were similar at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Credit Performance:   The table below provides an analysis of conventional loans delinquent or in the process of foreclosure, along with the national average serious delinquency rate.  

(1) 
    Includes conventional loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and not in foreclosure. 
              (2) 
    Includes conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or where the decision of foreclosure or a similar alternative such as pursuit of deed-in-lieu has been reported. 
              (3) 
    Early stage delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio. 
              (4) 
    Serious delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.  
              (5) 
    National average number of fixed-rate prime conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure is based on the most recent national delinquency data available. The   September 30, 2016   rate is based on   June 30, 2016   data.  
       
  The MPP has experienced a small amount of delinquencies and foreclosures, with rates continuing to be well below national averages. This further supports our view that the overall portfolio is comprised of high-quality, well-performing loans. 
    
  Credit Enhancements:   Conventional mortgage loans are supported against credit losses by various combinations of primary mortgage insurance (PMI), supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI) (for loans purchased before February 2011), and the Lender Risk Account (LRA). The LRA is a holdback of a portion of the initial purchase price to cover expected credit losses for a specific pool of loans. Starting after five years from the loan purchase date, we may return the holdback to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) if they manage credit risk to predefined acceptable levels of exposure on the loan pools they sell to us. The LRA had balances of   $179 million   and   $158 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For more information, see   Note 9   of the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements. 
    
  Credit Losses:   The following table shows the effects of credit enhancements on our estimation of credit losses at the noted periods. Estimated incurred credit losses, after credit enhancements, are accounted for in the allowance for credit losses or as a charge off (i.e., a reduction to the principal of mortgage loans held for portfolio).

The small amount of incurred losses provides further support on the aggregate health of the portfolio. Credit risk exposure depends on the actual and potential credit performance of the loans in each pool compared to the pool's equity (on individual loans) and credit enhancements, including PMI, the LRA, and SMI.  
    
  In addition to the allowance for credit losses recorded, we regularly analyze potential ranges of additional lifetime credit risk exposure for the loans in the MPP. Even under adverse scenarios for either home prices or unemployment rates, we expect that further credit losses would not significantly decrease profitability.

Investments 
  Liquidity Investments:   We purchase liquidity investments from counterparties that have a strong ability to repay principal and interest. Liquidity investments may be unsecured, guaranteed by the U.S. government, or secured (i.e., collateralized). For unsecured liquidity investments, we invest in the debt securities of highly rated, investment-grade institutions, have appropriate and conservative limits on dollar and maturity exposure to each institution, and have strong credit underwriting practices, including active monitoring of credit quality of our counterparties and of the environment in which they operate.  
    
  The following table presents the carrying value of liquidity investments outstanding in relation to the counterparties' lowest long-term credit ratings provided by Standard   Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. For resale agreements, the ratings shown are based on ratings of the associated collateral. 

(1) 
    Consists of securities that are issued and effectively guaranteed by Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac, which have the support of the U.S. government, although they are not obligations of the U.S. government. 
       
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we purchased a portion of our total liquidity investments from counterparties for which the investments are secured with collateral (secured resale agreements). We believe these investments present little or no credit risk exposure to us.  

67 

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents credit ratings of our unsecured investment credit exposure by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks.

    Represents the lowest long-term credit rating provided by Standard   Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. 
       
  The following table presents the remaining contractual maturity of our unsecured investment credit exposure by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. 

At   September 30, 2016  , all of the   $6.2 billion   of unsecured investment exposure was to counterparties with holding companies domiciled in countries receiving either AAA or AA long-term sovereign ratings. Furthermore, we restrict a significant portion of unsecured lending to overnight maturities, which further limits risk exposure to these counterparties. By Finance Agency regulation, all counterparties exposed to non-U.S. countries are required to be domestic U.S. branches of foreign counterparties. We also limit exposure to counterparties and countries that could have significant direct or indirect exposure to European sovereign debt. 
    
  Mortgage-Backed Securities. 
    
  GSE Mortgage-Backed Securities    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $11.7 billion   of mortgage-backed securities held were GSE securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide credit safeguards by guaranteeing either timely or ultimate payments of principal and interest. We believe that the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower the chance that they would not be able to fulfill their credit guarantees and that the securities issued by these two GSEs are effectively government guaranteed. In addition, based on the data available to us and our purchase practices, we believe that most of the mortgage loans backing our GSE mortgage-backed securities are of high quality with acceptable credit performance.  

68 

     Table of Contents  

Mortgage-Backed Securities Issued by Other Government Agencies    
  We also invest in mortgage-backed securities issued and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and the NCUA. These investments totaled   $3.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . We believe that the strength of the issuers' guarantees and backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us against credit losses on these securities. 
    
  Derivatives 
  Credit Risk Exposure:   The table below presents the derivative positions to which we had credit risk exposure at   September 30, 2016  .  

(1) 
    Each category includes the related plus (+) and minus (-) ratings (i.e.,  A  includes  A+  and  A-  ratings). 
              (2) 
    Represents derivative transactions cleared with clearinghouses, which are not rated. 
              (3) 
    Represents Mandatory Delivery Contracts. 
       
  Our exposure to cleared derivatives is primarily associated with our requirement to post initial margin through the clearing agent to the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. The amount of cash collateral pledged as initial margin has increased from our use of cleared derivatives. However, the use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties.  
    
  We mitigate most of the credit risk exposure resulting from uncleared derivative transactions through collateralization. Based on both the gross and net exposures, we had a minimal amount (less than $1 million) of residual credit risk exposure on uncleared derivatives at   September 30, 2016  . Gross exposure could change if the composition of our derivatives change. However, contractual collateral provisions in these derivatives would limit net exposure to acceptable levels. 

Although we cannot predict if we will realize credit risk losses from any of our derivatives counterparties, we believe that all of the counterparties will be able to continue making timely interest payments and, more generally, to continue to satisfy the terms and conditions of their derivative contracts with us. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0.4 billion   of notional principal of interest rate swaps outstanding to one member, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which also had outstanding credit services with us. Due to the amount of market value collateralization, we had no outstanding credit exposure to this counterparty related to interest rate swaps outstanding. 
    
  Lehman Brothers Derivatives:   See   Note 19   of the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements for information on derivatives we had with Lehman Brothers at the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008.

Exposure to Member Concentration 
    
  We regularly assess concentration risks from business activity. We believe that the current concentration of Advance activity is consistent with our risk management philosophy, and the impact of borrower concentration on market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, after considering mitigating controls, is small.  

Liquidity Risk  
    
  Liquidity Overview 
  The FHLBank System's primary source of funds is the sale of Consolidated Obligations in the capital markets. Our ability to obtain funds through the sale of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs depends on the financial market's perceived riskiness of the Obligations and on prevailing conditions in the capital markets, particularly the short-term capital markets. The System's favorable debt ratings, the implicit U.S. government backing of our debt, and our effective risk management practices are instrumental in ensuring satisfactory access to the capital markets.  
    
  We believe our liquidity position, as well as that of the System, remained strong during the first   nine   months of   2016  . Our overall ability to effectively fund our operations through debt issuances remained sufficient. Investor demand for System debt remains robust and, we believe, increased in the first   nine   months of   2016  . Although we can make no assurances, we expect this to continue to be the case. We believe the possibility of a liquidity or funding crisis in the System that would impair our ability to participate, on a cost-effective basis, in issuances of new debt, service outstanding debt, maintain adequate capitalization, or pay competitive dividends is remote. See the "Consolidated Obligations" section of "Analysis of Financial Condition" for further information on our funding actions throughout 2016.  
    
  The System works collectively to manage and monitor the system-wide liquidity, funding, and refinancing risks. The System has a large reliance on short-term funding; therefore, it has a sharp focus on managing liquidity risk to low levels. As shown on the Statements of Cash Flows, in the first   nine   months of   2016  , our portion of the System's debt issuances totaled   $242.3 billion   for Discount Notes and   $44.4 billion   for Bonds. See the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding contractual maturities of certain financial assets and liabilities which are instrumental in determining the amount of liquidity risk. 
    
  A primary way that we manage liquidity is to meet operational and contingency liquidity requirements. We satisfied the operational liquidity requirement by both meeting a contingency liquidity requirement, discussed below, and because we were able to adequately access the capital markets to issue debt. Liquidity investments, most of which were overnight, were generally in the range of $5 billion to $15 billion during the first   nine   months of   2016  . In addition, Finance Agency guidance requires us to target at least 5 to 15 consecutive days of a positive amount of liquidity based on specific assumptions under two scenarios. We target holding at least three extra days of positive liquidity under each scenario, although as market conditions warrant we may hold, and often do hold, additional amounts.  
    
  Contingency Liquidity Requirement 
  Contingency liquidity risk is the potential inability to meet liquidity needs because our access to the capital markets to issue Consolidated Obligations is restricted or suspended for a period of time due to a market disruption, operational failure, or real or perceived credit quality problems. We continued to hold an ample amount of liquidity reserves to protect against contingency liquidity risk.

    Includes, among others, cash, overnight Federal funds, overnight deposits, self-liquidating term Federal funds, 95 percent of the market value of available-for-sale negotiable securities, and 75 percent of the market value of certain held-to-maturity obligations, including obligations of the United States, U.S. government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 
       
           (2) 
    Includes net liabilities maturing in the next seven business days, assets traded not yet settled, Advance commitments outstanding, Advances maturing in the next seven business days, and a three percent hypothetical increase in Advances.

     Table of Contents  

Deposit Reserve Requirement 
  To support our member deposits, we also must meet a statutory deposit reserve requirement. The sum of our investments in obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, and Advances with a final maturity not exceeding five years must equal or exceed the current amount of member deposits. The following table presents the components of this liquidity requirement. 

Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at   September 30, 2016  . The allocations according to the expiration terms and payment due dates of these obligations were not materially different from those at the end of   2015  . Changes reflected normal business variations. We believe that, as in the past, we will continue to have sufficient liquidity, including from access to the debt markets to issue Consolidated Obligations, to satisfy these obligations on a timely basis.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  Introduction 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (if applicable), and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. Although management believes its judgments, estimates, and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ and other parties could arrive at different conclusions. 
  
    71 

     Table of Contents  

There have been no material changes in the first nine months of 2016 to our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Accounting for Premiums and Discounts on Mortgage Loans 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we intend to change our accounting policy related to the amortization of premiums and discounts and hedging basis adjustments related to our mortgage loans from the retrospective level-yield method to the contractual level-yield method, subject to required due process. Any such change will require a retrospective application whereby each individual prior period presented in the financial statements included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K will be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying a new accounting principle. The effects of the change have not been finalized. We currently estimate the change could increase net income by approximately $15 million to $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. However, the impact on Total Assets and Total Capital is not expected to be material upon adoption.  

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
       
  Information required by this Item is set forth under the caption  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management  in Part I, Item 2, of this Report. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the FHLB's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, these two officers each concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the FHLB maintained effective disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is (1) accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the FHLB's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the FHLB's internal control over financial reporting. Based upon that evaluation, these two officers each concluded that there were no changes in the FHLB's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the FHLB's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors.           
       
  For a discussion of our risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
       
  From time to time the FHLB provides Letters of Credit in the ordinary course of business to support members' obligations issued in support of unaffiliated, third-party offerings of notes, bonds or other securities. The FHLB provided $0.8 million of such credit support during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . To the extent that these Letters of Credit are securities for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, their issuance is exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(2) thereof.

Item 5. 
    Other Information. 
       
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) serves as the independent registered public accounting firm for the FHLB. Rule 201(c)(1)(ii)(A) of SEC Regulation S-X (the Loan Rule) prohibits an accounting firm, such as PwC, from having certain financial relationships with its audit clients and affiliated entities. Specifically, the Loan Rule provides, in relevant part, that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a  record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client s equity securities.   
    
  PwC has advised the FHLB that as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 it had a borrowing relationship with an FHLB member (referred below as the  lender ) who owns more than ten percent of the FHLB s capital stock, which under the Loan Rule, would call into question PwC s independence with respect to the FHLB. The FHLB is providing this disclosure to explain the facts and circumstances, as well as PwC s and the Audit Committee s conclusions, concerning PwC s objectivity and impartiality with respect to the audit of the FHLB. 
    
  PwC advised the Audit Committee of the Board that it believes that, in light of the facts of this borrowing relationship, its ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all matters encompassed within PwC s audit engagement has not been impaired and that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion. PwC has advised the Audit Committee that this conclusion is based in part on the following considerations: 
             
    the borrowings are in good standing and the lender does not have the right to take action against PwC, as borrower, in connection with the financings; 
                
    the debt balances outstanding are immaterial to PwC and to the lender; 
                
    PwC has borrowing relationships with a diverse group of lenders, therefore PwC is not dependent on any single lender or group of lenders; and  
                
    the PwC audit engagement team has no involvement in PwC s treasury function and PwC s treasury function has no oversight or ability to influence the PwC audit engagement team. 
       
  Additionally, the Audit Committee assessed PwC s ability to perform an objective and impartial audit, including consideration of the ownership structure of the FHLB, the limited voting rights of members and the composition of the Board of Directors. In addition to the above listed considerations, the Audit Committee considered the following: 
             
    although the lender owned more than ten percent of the FHLB s capital stock, the lender s voting rights are less than ten percent;  
                
    no individual officer or director that serves on the Board of Directors has the ability to significantly influence the FHLB based on the composition of the Board of Directors; and  
        
  Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has concluded that PwC s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within PwC s audit engagement has not been impaired.

  ARTICLE VI 
     CAPITAL STOCK 
   
  1.        Issuance of Stock  .  The capital stock of the Bank may be issued only in accordance with Section 931.2 of the Regulations and only to Members of the Bank and may be held only by Members and, as provided in   Section VI.8.d.  , former Members of the Bank.  The Bank shall initially issue one class of capital stock, Class B Stock, as such stock is defined by the Act.  There shall be no Class A Stock, as such stock is defined in the Act, or subclasses of Class B Stock issued.  Subject to   Section III.2  , all shares of Class B Stock shall have the same rights and preferences.  Each share of Class B Stock shall be issued at a par value of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per share.  The Bank shall be entitled to issue an unlimited number of shares of Class B Stock.  Any shares of Class B Stock which are repurchased, redeemed or otherwise reacquired by the Bank shall be deemed cancelled and subsequently may be reissued.  The Bank reserves the right to authorize the issuance of Class A Stock and/or subclasses of Class B Stock, subject to Finance Agency approval.  A Member shall not be permitted to purchase shares of Class B Stock other than as set forth in this Capital Plan.  Shares of the Bank s capital stock shall not be certificated, but rather held in book entry form on the records of the Bank.  The Bank shall serve as transfer agent for all shares of its capital stock on its capital stock register.   
   
  2.        Allocation of Class B Stock  .  Each Member s Class B Stock shall be allocated by the Bank to one (1) of three (3) distinct accounts: a Membership Stock Account, an Activity Stock Account, and a Member Excess Stock Account.  Each share of Class B Stock may be allocated to only one (1) of the three (3) distinct accounts at a time; and a Member s total number of shares of Class B Stock shall be determined by adding the number of shares of Class B Stock in each of the Member s three (3) distinct accounts.  Additionally, each share of Class B Stock allocated to a Member s Activity Stock Account may be allocated to only one (1) of the three (3) distinct types of Mission Asset Activity at a time.  Shares may be reallocated from time to time among the types of Mission Asset Activity as the Member s activity changes.  A Member s shares of Class B Stock (whether acquired on the Effective Date or later acquired through purchase or by Stock Dividend) shall be first allocated to its Membership Stock Account.  Once a Member s Membership Stock Account requirement is satisfied, the Member s remaining Class B Stock shall be next allocated to its Activity Stock Account, and then to its Member Excess Stock  
  
     - 7 - 

Account. Transfers made between and among the accounts for any particular Member shall be made by the Bank based upon the following rules: 
  a.        Membership Stock Account  .  Membership Stock is the actual number of shares of Class B Stock owned by a Member as required to become a Member of or to retain membership status in the Bank.  The number of shares of a Member s Class B Stock allocated to the Member s Membership Stock Account shall be calculated as a percentage, or range of percentages, of the Member s Total Assets and shall be determined by the Bank yearly or more frequently as directed by the Bank s Board, in accordance with   Section VI.4.a  . 
  b.        Activity Stock Account  .  Activity Stock is the actual number of shares of Class B Stock owned by a Member and used to capitalize (in whole or in part) the Member s Mission Asset Activity with the Bank.  The number of shares of Class B Stock allocated to a Member s Activity Stock Account at any time shall ensure that, for each type of Mission Asset Activity, the ratio of the par value of the Member s Activity Stock to that type of Member s Mission Asset Activity is at least as large as its applicable Minimum Allocation Percentage, and no larger than its applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage.  For each type of Mission Asset Activity, the Minimum Allocation Percentage and the Maximum Allocation Percentage may be adjusted by the Bank s Board to facilitate compliance with the Bank s Capital Requirements as specified in the Act and the Regulations or as directed by the Finance Agency. 
  c.        Member Excess Stock Account  .  A Member s Member Excess Stock is the total par value of Class B Stock owned by the Member minus the sum of (i) the par value of Class B Stock allocated by the Bank to the Member s Membership Stock Account, and (ii) the total of the par values of Class B Stock that results from multiplying each type of the Member s Mission Asset Activity by its applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage.  If a Member s Member Excess Stock is a positive number, the Member actually owns Member Excess Stock equal to such positive number.  If a Member s Member Excess Stock is a negative number, the Member actually owns no excess stock and is, by definition, utilizing some portion of the Bank Excess Stock to capitalize its Mission Asset Activity.  
  d.        Timing of Transactions  .  All transactions affecting the Bank s capital stock made on the books and records of the Bank shall be made and deemed effective at the end of the applicable business day.   
   
  3.        [  Intentionally left blank  .] 
   
  4.        Minimum Investment by Members  . 
  a.        Required Shares  .  Each Member shall own at all times its Required Shares of Class B Stock.  There are two components to Required Shares:  Membership Stock and Activity Stock. 
  
     - 8 - 

(i)        Required Shares of Membership Stock  .  The sum of the Membership Stock of all Members shall capitalize the Bank s investment securities and minimum liquidity (as determined by the Bank).  The number of shares of a Member s Class B Stock allocated to the Member s Membership Stock Account shall be calculated on the basis of the Member s Total Assets within a range of declining percentages from no more than three-tenths of one percent (0.30%) to no less than three-hundredths of one percent (0.03%), subject, however, to a minimum Membership Stock investment requirement of no less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) or more than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and a maximum Membership Stock investment requirement of no less than Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) or more than Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000). The Bank s Board of Directors may set different applicable percentages and different minimum and maximum Membership Stock investment requirements within each of the foregoing ranges, as illustrated on Schedule A to this Capital Plan.  The amounts set from time to time shall be subject to periodic review and adjustment as determined by the Bank s Board.  The initial range of percentages and initial minimum and maximum Membership Stock investment requirements in effect as of the effective date of this amended   Section VI.4.a.i.   shall be fifteen-hundredths of one percent (0.15%)  **   to three hundredths of one percent (0.03%), and One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) and One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000)*, respectively.  Any change to such percentages or maximum or minimum Membership Stock investment requirement shall be announced with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to all Members before implementation of the change.   
  If the number of shares of Class B Stock a Member is required to hold in its Membership Stock Account decreases, such shares shall be first allocated to the Member s Activity Stock Account, up to the applicable Maximum Allocation Percentages as applied to each type of the Member s Mission Asset Activity.  Any remaining shares of Class B Stock shall then be allocated to the Member s Excess Stock Account.  If the number of shares of Class B Stock a Member is required to hold in its Membership Stock Account increases, such additional shares shall be allocated from the Member s Excess Stock Account to the Member s Membership Stock Account.  If, at the time of such increase, the Member has no or an insufficient amount of Member Excess Stock to satisfy its Membership Stock Account requirement or there is insufficient amount of Bank Excess Stock, or the Bank is not then in compliance with the requirements of this Capital Plan, the Act or the Regulations, the Member shall be required to purchase (on the effective date of the change specified in the notice) additional shares of Class B Stock to 
    
  *  The Maximum Membership Stock requirement was reduced by Board of Directors  action to Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) effective November 28   th   , 2011.  The previous Maximum Membership Stock requirement was Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and became effective August 16   th   , 2010. 
  **  The first tier of the Percentage for Membership Stock Allocation was reduced by the Board of Directors  action to 0.12 percent effective April 17   th   , 2015. 
  
     - 9 - 

satisfy its Membership Stock Account requirement.  A Member may not utilize any other Member s portion of Bank Excess Stock or its own Activity Stock to satisfy its Membership Stock Account requirement.  
  (ii)        New Member Membership Stock Purchase Requirement  .  From the date of approval of an institution s membership application by the Bank, the institution shall be granted sixty (60) calendar days in which to purchase the number of shares of Class B Stock necessary to satisfy its Membership Stock Account.  The institution may not, however, engage in any Mission Asset Activity with the Bank until the institution has purchased all of its Required Shares. 
  (iii)        Required Shares of Activity Stock    The number of shares of Class B Stock allocated to a Member s Activity Stock Account at any time shall ensure that, for each type of Mission Asset Activity, the ratio of the par value of the Member s Activity Stock to that type of the Member s Mission Asset Activity is at least as large as its applicable Minimum Allocation Percentage and no larger than  its applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage.  For types i and ii of a Member s Mission Asset Activity, the Minimum Allocation Percentage shall be two percent (2%) and the Maximum Allocation Percentage shall be four percent (4%); and for type iii of a Member s Mission Asset Activity, the Minimum Allocation Percentage shall be zero percent (0%) and the Maximum Allocation Percentage shall be four percent (4%).  Such percentages may be periodically adjusted between one percent (1%) and six percent (6%), inclusive, for types i and ii of the Member s Mission Asset Activity, and between zero percent (0%) and six percent (6%), inclusive, for type iii of the Member s Mission Asset Activity as determined by the Bank s Board, with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to all members. 
  The number of shares of Class B Stock a Member shall hold in its Activity Stock Account may fluctuate with the Member s Mission Asset Activity.  An increase in any type of a Member s Mission Asset Activity first shall be capitalized, pursuant to   Section VI.4.b.  , by a reallocation of the Member s Member Excess Stock (to the extent the Member holds a sufficient number of shares of Member Excess Stock and provided there are sufficient shares of Bank Excess Stock available) to the Member s Activity Stock Account at the appropriate Maximum Allocation Percentage for that type of Mission Asset Activity.  In such an event, the Member shall not be permitted to purchase additional shares of Class B Stock; and the Member s Member Excess Stock Account shall be reduced by the number of shares of Member Excess Stock reallocated to its Activity Stock Account.  To the extent a Member has an insufficient number of shares of Member Excess Stock to capitalize all of an increase to its Mission Asset Activity, the portion of the incremental Mission Asset Activity not so capitalized by the Member s Activity Stock shall be capitalized by Bank Excess Stock at the appropriate Maximum Allocation Percentage for that type of Mission Asset Activity pursuant to   Section  
  
     - 10 - 

VI.4.b.    In such an event, the Member shall not be permitted to purchase additional shares of Class B Stock, and the amount of Bank Excess Stock shall be reduced by the number of shares allocated from the Member s Member Excess Stock and by the number of additional shares of other Members  portion of the Bank Excess Stock used to capitalize the incremental Mission Asset Activity.  If the Bank has insufficient Bank Excess Stock, in the Bank s sole discretion, to permit utilization of the Bank Excess Stock to capitalize all or a portion of a Member s incremental Mission Asset Activity, the Member, regardless of whether it holds Member Excess Stock, shall be required to purchase (on the effective date of the change specified in the notice) additional shares of Class B Stock, at the appropriate Maximum Allocation Percentage for that type of Mission Asset Activity, to capitalize the portion of the incremental Mission Asset Activity not capitalized with Bank Excess Stock. 
  If, after a decrease in a Member s Mission Asset Activity, the number of shares of Class B Stock in the Member s Activity Stock Account is less than the number required to capitalize the Member s remaining Mission Asset Activity at the applicable Maximum Allocation Percentages for the different types of Mission Asset Activity, the number of shares of Class B Stock in the Member s Activity Stock Account shall not change.  If, after a decrease in a Member s Mission Asset Activity, the number of shares in the Member s Activity Stock Account is greater than the number required to capitalize the Member s remaining Mission Asset Activity at the applicable Maximum Allocation Percentages for the different types of Mission Asset Activity, the extra shares shall be allocated to the Member s Member Excess Stock Account. 
  b.        Bank Excess Stock  . Bank Excess Stock is the total par value of Class B Stock owned by all Members minus the sum of (i) the par value of Class B Stock allocated by the Bank to the Members  Membership Stock Accounts, (ii) the total of the par values of Class B Stock resulting from multiplying each type of Members  Mission Asset Activity by its applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage, (iii) the par value of shares of Member Excess Stock which are reserved for Members  exclusive use as provided in   Section VI.5.c.   and (iv) the par value of shares of Member Excess Stock which are the subject of outstanding Redemption and Withdrawal Notices.  Other Members  portions of Bank Excess Stock may not be utilized, under any circumstances, to satisfy a Member s Membership Stock Account.  Each Member s Member Excess Stock (not otherwise reserved for its exclusive use or excluded from Bank Excess Stock because it is the subject of an outstanding Redemption or Withdrawal Notice) shall be pooled into Bank Excess Stock and made available to all Members to capitalize Mission Asset Activity at a rate equal to the applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage for each type of Mission Asset Activity.  If at any time the Bank, in its sole discretion, has determined that Bank Excess Stock may not be used to capitalize incremental Mission Asset Activity, or if any of the Bank s Capital Requirements are not satisfied, a Member (regardless of whether the Member has shares of Class B Stock allocated to its Member  
  
     - 11 - 

Excess Stock Account) seeking to capitalize an increase in its Mission Asset Activity shall be required to purchase an additional amount of Class B Stock at a rate at least equal to the applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage of the type of Member s incremental Mission Asset Activity.  With respect to utilization of Bank Excess Stock by the Members, the following shall apply: 
  (i)        Percentage Limitation  .  Each Member must at all times retain in its own Activity Stock Account a number of shares of Class B Stock sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Allocation Percentages for each type of Mission Asset Activity then engaged in by the Member.  If a Member is at the Minimum Allocation Percentage for a type of Mission Asset Activity and desires to increase that type of Mission Asset Activity and is not at the applicable Minimum Allocation Percentage for the other type(s) of Mission Asset Activity, the Member s Activity Stock will be reallocated from the other type(s) of Mission Asset Activity to the respective Minimum Allocation Percentage(s).  If such reallocation does not provide sufficient Class B Stock to support the Member s increased Mission Asset Activity, the Member shall be required to purchase additional shares of Class B Stock in an amount that will maintain the applicable Minimum Allocation Percentage. 
  (ii)        Maximum Dollar Amount  .  No Member may use more than One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) (exclusive of the par value of the Member s Member Excess Stock Account) of available Bank Excess Stock as the Maximum Dollar Amount. If a Member reaches the Maximum Dollar Amount and desires to increase its Mission Asset Activity, the Member shall be required to purchase additional shares of Class B Stock, at the applicable Maximum Allocation Percentage for the specific type of Mission Asset Activity, to capitalize that type of incremental Mission Asset Activity.  The Bank shall retain sole discretion to adjust the Maximum Dollar Amount from time to time.   
   
  5.        Dividends  . 
  a.        In General  .  The Bank may pay dividends on its capital stock only out of previously retained earnings or current net earnings (as determined by the Bank in accordance with GAAP).  The Bank s Board shall determine the dividend rates. 
  b.        Scheduled Dividend Payments  .  Dividends shall be paid at the Bank s discretion to Members based upon the average total number of shares of Class B Stock actually owned by a Member during the period for which the distribution is to be made.  The number of shares of Class B Stock actually owned by a Member in such period shall be determined based upon the number of days or the percentage of the period each share of Class B Stock was owned by the Member (regardless of whether the Member holds such share on the date the dividend is paid).  Dividends, if declared and paid, shall be paid quarterly, except as otherwise declared by the Bank s Board, and shall be noncumulative.  Dividends earned in respect of any given period shall be paid on such  
  
     - 12 - 

schedule as shall be determined from time to time by the Board.  Dividends may be paid in the form of additional shares of Class B Stock, in cash, in any combination thereof, or in such other form as the Bank may determine at the time of such dividend distribution. 
  c.        Period of Exclusive Use  .  Stock Dividends paid shall be first allocated to a Member s Membership Stock Account.  If, after a Member s Membership Stock Account is satisfied, the Member has additional shares of Class B Stock resulting from a Stock Dividend, the Bank shall allocate such additional shares to the Member s Activity Stock Account to the extent the Member s Mission Asset Activity is capitalized by the Member s Activity Stock at less than the Maximum Allocation Percentage.  If, after a Member s Membership Stock Account is satisfied and the total number of shares in its Activity Stock Account satisfies the Maximum Allocation Percentages for each type of the Member s Mission Asset Activity, the Member has additional shares of Class B Stock resulting from a Stock Dividend, such shares shall be allocated to the Member s Member Excess Stock Account.  A Member receiving such Stock Dividends, and having incremental shares of Class B Stock in its Member Excess Stock Account as a result of such Stock Dividends, shall have, for the three- (3)- month period immediately following the Stock Dividend payment, exclusive rights to utilize such Stock Dividends to capitalize the Member s (and only the Member s) incremental Mission Asset Activity. 
  d.        Limitation of Issuance  .  The Bank shall not, under any circumstances, declare or pay any dividends on its capital stock if in doing so (and taking into account the effect of any such dividend) the Bank would fail to meet any of its Capital Requirements.  Nor shall the Bank declare any dividend on its capital stock if (i) the Bank is not then in compliance with any one or more of its Capital Requirements; or (ii) the Bank determines that to do so would create a safety and soundness issue for the Bank. 
  e.        Dividends Made In Error  .  If any dividends are paid in error by the Bank in contravention of   Section VI.5.d.  , the Members receiving such dividends shall return to the Bank all such dividends within thirty (30) calendar days of written notification by the Bank.  In requiring the return of such distributions, the Bank shall incur no liability to its Members. 
   
  6.        Transfer of Capital Stock  .  Any stock issued by the Bank shall be tradable and transferable only between the Bank and its Members.  Any transfer shall be undertaken only in accordance with Section 931.6 of the Regulations.  Upon application of the Member as set forth below and the approval of the Bank, a Member may transfer any number of shares of Class B Stock actually held in the Member s Excess Stock Account to another Member of the Bank or to an institution that has been approved for and has satisfied all the conditions of membership in the Bank other than the purchase of Required Shares.  Such transfers shall be made at the par value of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per share.  The Bank shall serve as transfer agent for the Class B Stock.   
  A Member wishing to transfer all or a portion of its Member Excess Stock to another Member must submit a request in writing to the Bank at least thirty (30) days prior to the date the  
  
     - 13 - 

transfer is desired to take place ( Transfer Request ).  The Transfer Request shall include: (1) the names of the Members wishing to consummate the transfer; (2) the number of shares of Class B Stock to be transferred; (3) the desired date of transfer; (4) a brief statement as to the reason(s) for the transfer; and (5) the authorized signature of each party to the proposed transaction indicating its respective desire to execute the transfer.  Upon receipt of the Transfer Request, the Bank shall evaluate the request and, no later than the third business day prior to the date of transfer, in its sole discretion, either approve or disapprove the transfer.  
   
  7.        Redemption and Repurchase of Capital Stock  . 
  a.        Redemption of Member Excess Stock  .  A Member may request that the Bank redeem all or any portion of the Member s shares of Class B Stock, without affecting the Member s membership status, by submitting a Redemption Notice to the Bank.  The Redemption Notice shall state the number of shares of Class B Stock targeted for redemption, and a Member may not have more than one Redemption Notice outstanding at any time covering the same shares of Class B Stock.  Until the shares are redeemed, or earlier repurchased pursuant to   Section VI.7.b.  , a Member shall continue to receive dividends on the shares of Class B Stock targeted for redemption.  Subject to   Sections VI.10., 11. and 12.  , at the end of the Redemption Period (unless the Redemption Notice has been cancelled), the Bank shall redeem, in accordance with   Section VI.7.c.  , all of the shares of Class B Stock covered by the Redemption Notice that are Member Excess Stock on the date the Redemption Notice becomes effective.  If the Bank is unable to redeem all or any portion of those shares of Class B Stock at the end of the Redemption Period because of restrictions set forth in this Capital Plan, the Act or the Regulations, the Bank may redeem the shares, without further notice or waiting period, when and as permitted by this Capital Plan and, if applicable, permitted or required by the Finance Agency.  If at any time the Bank is able to redeem some, but not all, of the shares of Class B Stock that are covered by effective Redemption Notices, the Bank shall honor the redemption requests on a first come/first served basis, based upon the date and time such Redemption Notices were marked received by the Bank. 
  b.        Repurchase of Member Excess Stock  .  Subject to   Sections VI.10., 11. and 12.  , the Bank shall have the right at any time to repurchase, in accordance with   Section VI.7.c.  , all or any portion of its Members  Member Excess Stock, above their Protected Excess Stock.  Any such repurchase shall be at the sole discretion of the Bank and shall be initiated by giving each affected Member no less than five (5) calendar days  prior written notice.  If and when the Bank determines to repurchase Member Excess Stock, the Bank shall first purchase any shares of Class B Stock for which Redemption Notices have become effective but have not been fully honored, in the order in which those Redemption Notices became effective.  To the extent the Bank has determined to repurchase more shares of Class B Stock, it then shall repurchase those shares for which Redemption Notices have been filed but not yet become effective, in the order in which those Notices were filed.  In the event the Bank determines to repurchase more shares of Class B Stock than are currently covered by outstanding Redemption Notices, the Bank  
  
     - 14 - 

shall repurchase the additional shares from each Member having a positive number of shares in its Member Excess Stock Account after removing each Member s applicable Protected Excess Stock, in proportion to the total number of shares of Class B Stock then allocated to each Member s Excess Stock Account after removing each Member s applicable Excess Stock.  Protected Excess Stock shall be the greater of a) twenty-five percent (25.0%) of a Member s Required Shares or b) fifteen thousand (15,000) shares of Member Excess Stock with a par value of One Million Five-Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000).  The Protected Excess Stock percentage and numerical levels may be set from time to time and shall be subject to periodic review and adjustment as determined by the Bank s Board of Directors in their sole discretion within the aforesaid ranges.  The range of percentages and levels of Protected Excess Stock shall be zero percent (0.0%) to thirty percent (30.0%), and the numerical level range shall be between zero and thirty thousand (30,000) shares of Member Excess Stock with a maximum par value of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000). 
  c.        Redemption and Repurchase Price  .  All redemptions and repurchases of shares of Class B Stock shall be made by the Bank in immediately available funds at the par value of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per share.  Once a share is redeemed or repurchased, pursuant to   Sections VI.7.a. and VI.7.b.   and subject to   Section VI.5.b.  , the Member s rights and privileges and the Bank s obligations with respect to such share shall immediately terminate and the Member shall be deemed to have surrendered the share to the Bank. 
  d.        Cancellation of Redemption Notice  .  A Member shall have five (5) calendar days from the date the Bank receives a Redemption Notice from the Member to submit a Cancellation Notice to the Bank and to cancel that Redemption Notice without penalty or fee.  If a Member desires to cancel a Redemption Notice after the five (5) calendar day grace period has expired, the Member may do so by providing a Cancellation Notice to the Bank, but the Bank shall charge a Cancellation Fee, as a percent of the par value of the Class B Stock referenced in the Redemption Notice, based upon the year in which the Redemption Notice is cancelled according to the following schedule: two percent (2%) in the first year, three percent (3%) in the second year, four percent (4%) in the third year, five percent (5%) in the fourth year, and six percent (6%) in the fifth year.  To be effective, the Cancellation Notice must be received by the Bank before the Redemption Notice to which it relates becomes effective and before the Bank repurchases the shares of stock referenced in the Redemption Notice.  From time to time, the Bank s Board, in its sole discretion, may waive the Cancellation Fee if it has a bona fide business purpose for doing so and the waiver is consistent with Section 1427(j) of the Act or may change the Cancellation Fee schedule to reduce all or any portion of the Fee.  
  e.        Automatic Cancellation of Redemption  .  A Member s Redemption Notice shall automatically be cancelled to the extent the Bank is prevented from redeeming any Class B Stock which is the subject of the Notice within five (5) business days after the  
  
     - 15 - 

end of the Redemption Period because the Member would fail to maintain its minimum investment in the stock of the Bank after such redemption.  The automatic cancellation of a Member s Redemption Notice shall have the same effect as if the Member had cancelled its Redemption Notice pursuant to   Section VI.7.d.  , including the applicability of the Cancellation Fee specified therein.    
   
  8.        Termination of Membership  . 
  a.        Voluntary Withdrawal  .  Any Member may initiate its withdrawal from membership in the Bank by filing a Withdrawal Notice with the Bank.  Within ten (10) calendar days of receiving such Withdrawal Notice, the Bank shall forward a copy of the Withdrawal Notice to the Finance Agency.  During the Withdrawal Period, the Member shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights, and other membership rights commensurate with continuing stock ownership.  Subject to   Section VI.8.d.   and   Sections VI.10., 11. and 12.  , and provided that the Withdrawal Notice has not been cancelled in accordance with   Section VI.8.b.  , at the expiration of the Withdrawal Period, (a) the institution s membership in the Bank shall terminate, (b) the Bank shall redeem, in immediately available funds at their par value (less any obligations due and owing by the institution to the Bank), the shares of Class B Stock owned by the institution on the date the Withdrawal Notice was filed and (c) the institution shall not be entitled to any other rights or privileges accorded to Members; provided, however, that the institution may receive dividends earned pursuant to   Section VI.5.b.  , to the extent that those dividend payments exceed any such obligations due and owing to the Bank.  If the Bank is unable to redeem the shares of Class B Stock at the end of the Withdrawal Period because of restrictions set forth in this Capital Plan, the Act or the Regulations, the Bank may redeem the shares, without further notice or waiting period, when and as permitted by this Capital Plan and, if applicable, permitted or required by the Finance Agency.  If at any time the Bank is able to redeem some, but not all, of the shares of Class B Stock subject to Withdrawal Notices, the Bank shall honor the Withdrawal Notices on a first come/first served basis, based upon the date and time such Withdrawal Notices became effective.  The Withdrawal Period shall automatically commence for any additional shares of Class B Stock acquired by the institution (by purchase or in the form of Stock Dividends) after the date the Withdrawal Notice initially was filed on the date the additional shares are received.  In its sole discretion, the Bank may repurchase such after-acquired shares from time to time, provided that they are not required to support any indebtedness of the institution to, or business transaction of the institution with, the Bank.   
  b.        Cancellation of Withdrawal Notice  .  A Member shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date the Bank receives the Member s Withdrawal Notice to submit a Cancellation Notice to the Bank and to cancel the Withdrawal Notice without penalty or fee. If a Member desires to cancel a Withdrawal Notice after the thirty (30) calendar day grace period has expired, the Member may do so by providing a Cancellation Notice to the Bank, but the Bank shall charge a Cancellation Fee, as a percent of the par value of the Class B Stock referenced in the Withdrawal Notice, based  
  
     - 16 - 

upon the year in which the Withdrawal Notice is cancelled according to the following initial schedule: two percent (2%) in the first year, three percent (3%) in the second year, four percent (4%) in the third year, five percent (5%) in the fourth year, and six percent (6%) in the fifth year.  To be effective, the Cancellation Notice must be received by the Bank before the Withdrawal Notice becomes effective.  From time to time, the Bank s Board, in its sole discretion, may waive the Cancellation Fee if it has a bona fide business purpose for doing so and the waiver is consistent with Section 1427(j) of the Act or may change the Cancellation Fee schedule to reduce all or any portion of the Fee.  The Bank s Board may, in its sole discretion, establish a Cancellation Fee applicable to Withdrawal Notices that is different than the Cancellation Fee applicable to Redemption Notices. 
  c.        Involuntary Withdrawal  .  The Bank s Board may terminate the membership of any institution that (i) fails to comply with any requirement of this Capital Plan, the Act or any Regulation prescribed under the Act, in effect from time to time, (ii) becomes insolvent or otherwise subject to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, or other legal custodian under federal law or state law applicable to the institution, or (iii) would jeopardize the safety or soundness of the Bank if it were to remain a Member.  The institution s membership in the Bank shall terminate as of the date the Bank s Board acts, at which time a five- (5-) year redemption period for the shares of Class B Stock owned by the institution on that date shall commence and after which the institution shall not be entitled to any rights or privileges accorded to Members; provided, however, the institution may receive dividends earned pursuant to   Section VI.5.b.   until its Class B Stock is redeemed.  At the end of the redemption period provided for in this   Section VI.8.c.  , and subject to   Section VI.8.d.  , the Bank shall redeem, in immediately available funds at their par value (less any obligations due and owing by the institution to the Bank), the shares of Class B Stock owned by the institution on the date the institution s membership in the Bank terminated.  A five- (5-) year redemption period shall automatically commence for any shares of Class B Stock acquired by the institution as Stock Dividends after the date on which the institution s membership in the Bank terminated.  In its sole discretion, the Bank may repurchase such after-acquired shares from time to time, provided that they are not required to support any indebtedness of the institution to, or business transaction of the institution with, the Bank.   
  d.        Additional Conditions Relating to Withdrawal  .  A Member s voluntary withdrawal pursuant to   Section VI.3.a.   or   Section VI.8.a.  , or involuntary withdrawal pursuant to   Section VI.8.c.  , as a Member of the Bank shall be effective as of the applicable date specified in each such Section and, thereafter, regardless of any shares of the Bank s capital stock still held (as contemplated by the following sentence), the Member shall no longer be a Member and shall have no rights accorded to Members other than as are specified in the applicable Section.  Notwithstanding the provisions of those Sections or any other provision of this Capital Plan, the Bank shall not redeem or repurchase shares of Class B Stock from an institution that has withdrawn from membership in the Bank, or that otherwise has had its membership in the Bank terminated, to the extent that those shares are required to support  ,   at up to the Maximum  
  
     - 17 - 

Allocation Percentage in effect from time to time and applicable to the type of Mission Asset Activity  ,   any indebtedness of the institution to, or business transaction of the institution with, the Bank until after such indebtedness or business transaction has been extinguished or settled.   
  For purposes of determining the number of shares of Class B Stock required to support an institution s remaining indebtedness to or business transactions with the Bank, all shares of Membership Stock held by the institution on the effective date of withdrawal, as well as all shares subsequently received as Stock Dividends, shall be classified as Activity Stock.  In particular, but without limitation, this   Section VI.8.d.   shall operate so that if a receiver or similar liquidating entity or legal custodian has been appointed for a Member and/or its assets, and the Bank has terminated the Member s and/or the entity s membership, the Member s and/or entity s Membership Stock obligation on the effective date of termination shall be zero, and all such Membership Stock shall by operation of this   Section VI.8.d.   be automatically converted to Activity Stock. 
  e.        Rejoining After Divestiture of All Shares of Stock  .  Except as provided herein, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, an institution that divests all shares of stock in the Bank or any other Federal Home Loan Bank may not, after such divestiture, acquire shares of the Bank before the end of a five (5) year period beginning on the date of the completion of such divestiture, except as provided in   Section VI.9  ; provided, however, that if the divestiture was made prior to December 31, 1997, such institution may acquire shares of the Bank at any time after that date, subject to the Act and approval by the Bank and the Finance Agency. 
   
  9.        Consolidation of Members  . 
  a.        Consolidation of Members of the Bank  .  Upon consolidation of two or more Members of the Bank into one institution operating under the charter of one of the consolidating institutions, the transfer of Class B Stock owned by the disappearing institution(s) to the consolidated institution shall be deemed approved by the Bank.  All shares of Class B Stock shall be allocated to the consolidated institution s stock accounts pursuant to   Section VI.2.   hereof and any share of Class B Stock thereby in such consolidated institution s Member Excess Stock Account may be redeemed in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this Capital Plan. 
  b.        Consolidation of a Member into a Member of Another Federal Home Loan Bank  .  If a Member is consolidated with and into a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank other than the Bank, and, after the consolidation, the Member is to operate under the charter of the consolidated institution, the Member s membership in the Bank shall terminate upon cancellation of its charter; provided, however, that if more than eighty percent (80%) of the assets of the consolidated institution are derived from the assets of the disappearing Member, then the consolidated institution shall continue to be a Member of the Bank.  In the event of a termination as provided in this   Section VI.9.b.  , liquidation  
  
     - 18 - 

of the Member s shares of Class B Stock shall be in accordance with the Act and Section 925.29 of the Regulations. 
  c.        Consolidation of a Member into a Non-Member  .  If a Member is consolidated with and into an institution that is not a member of any Federal Home Loan Bank, the Member s membership in the Bank shall terminate upon cancellation of the Member s charter.  In the event that the consolidated institution has its principal place of business within the District of the Bank, the consolidated institution shall have sixty (60) calendar days after the cancellation of the Member s charter to notify the Bank that the consolidated institution intends to apply for membership in the Bank.  The consolidated institution shall then have sixty (60) calendar days from the aforementioned notice to apply for membership in the Bank.  Prior to membership approval for the consolidated institution, the disappearing institution may continue to hold any outstanding Bank advances and shares of Class B Stock, and the consolidated institution shall have the rights associated with such shares of Class B Stock.  The consolidated institution shall, within sixty (60) calendar days of its approval for membership status, purchase shares of Class B Stock as necessary to satisfy the Member s Membership Stock Account and Activity Stock Account requirements.  If the consolidated institution does not apply for membership, or if its application for membership is denied, then the liquidation of any outstanding indebtedness owed to the Bank and the redemption of the Member s shares of Class B Stock shall be carried out in accordance with the Act and Section 925.29 of the Regulations. 
   
  10.        Failure to Meet Capital Requirements  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Capital Plan, the Bank may not redeem or repurchase any shares of its capital stock if the Bank is not then in compliance with any one or more of its Capital Requirements or if, as provided in Section 931.7(c) of the Regulations, following the redemption or repurchase, the Bank would fail to meet any of its Capital Requirements or the Member would fail to maintain its minimum investment in the capital stock of the Bank as required by the Regulations and this Capital Plan. 
   
  11.        Capital Impairment  .  In accordance with Section 931.8(a) of the Regulations, the Bank may not and shall not redeem or repurchase any capital stock without the prior written approval of the Finance Agency, if the Finance Agency or the Bank s Board has determined that the Bank has at the time of such proposed redemption or repurchase incurred, or is likely to incur, losses that result in, or are likely to result in, Charges Against the Capital of the Bank.  This prohibition shall apply even if the Bank is in compliance with its Capital Requirements, and shall remain in effect for however long the Bank continues to incur such Charges, or until the Finance Agency determines such Charges are not expected to continue, or otherwise in accordance with the Act, the Regulations and any applicable rulings of the Finance Agency. 
   
  12.        Bank s Discretion to Suspend Redemption  .  In accordance with Section 931.8(b) of the Regulations, the Bank, upon the approval of the Bank s Board, or a subcommittee thereof, may suspend the redemption of any of the Bank s stock if the Bank reasonably believes that the continued redemption of stock would cause the Bank to fail to meet its Capital Requirements,  
  
     - 19 - 

would prevent the Bank from maintaining adequate capital against potential risk that may not be adequately reflected in its Capital Requirements, or would otherwise prevent the Bank from operating in a safe and sound manner.  The Bank shall notify the Finance Agency within two business days of the date of its decision to suspend the redemption of stock, informing the Finance Agency of the reasons for the suspension and of the Bank s strategies and timeframes for addressing the conditions that led to the suspension. The Finance Agency may require the Bank to re-institute the redemption of stock.  The Bank shall not repurchase any stock without the written permission of the Finance Agency during any period in which the Bank has suspended redemption of stock under this   Section VI.12  .   
   
  13.        Transition Provision  .  The Bank shall comply with the minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements specified in Sections 932.2 and 932.3 of the Regulations, respectively, and each Member shall comply with the minimum stock investment established in this Capital Plan, as of the Effective Date of this Capital Plan.

restrictions on the use of the Restricted Retained Earnings imposed in the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment. 
  b.        Funding of Account  .   
  (i)        Date on which Allocation Begins  .  The Bank shall allocate to its Restricted Retained Earnings account an amount at least equal to the Regular Contribution Amount beginning on the REFCORP Termination Date.  The Bank shall allocate amounts to the Restricted Retained Earnings account only through contributions from its Quarterly Net Income or Adjustments to Prior Net Income occurring on or after the REFCORP Termination Date, but nothing in the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment shall prevent the Bank from allocating a greater percentage of its Quarterly Net Income or positive Adjustment to Prior Net Income to its Restricted Retained Earnings account than the percentages set forth in the Retained Earning Capital Plan Amendment. 
  (ii)        Ongoing Allocation  .  During any Dividend Restriction Period that occurs before the Allocation Termination Date, the Bank shall continue to allocate its Regular Contribution Amount (or when and if required under   Section X.2.b.iv.   below, its Special Contribution Amount) to its Restricted Retained Earnings.   
  (iii)        Treatment of Quarterly Net Losses and Annual Net Losses  .  In the event the Bank sustains a Net Loss for a calendar quarter, the following shall apply: (A) to the extent that its cumulative calendar year-to-date net income is positive at the end of such quarter, the Bank may decrease the amount of its Restricted Retained Earnings such that the cumulative addition to the Restricted Retained Earnings account calendar year-to-date at the end of such quarter is equal to 20 percent of the amount of such cumulative calendar year-to-date net income; (B) to the extent that its cumulative calendar year-to-date net income is negative at the end of such quarter (x) the Bank may decrease the amount of its Restricted Retained Earnings account such that the cumulative addition calendar year-to-date to the Restricted Retained Earnings account at the end of such quarter is zero, and (y) the Bank shall apply any remaining portion of the Net Loss for the calendar quarter first to reduce Retained Earnings that are not Restricted Retained Earnings until such Retained Earnings are reduced to zero, and thereafter may apply any remaining portion of the Net Loss for the calendar quarter to reduce Restricted Retained Earnings; and (C) for any subsequent calendar quarter in the same calendar year, the Bank may decrease the amount of its quarterly allocation to its Restricted Retained Earnings account in that subsequent calendar quarter such that the cumulative addition to the Restricted Retained Earnings account calendar year-to-date is equal to 20 percent of the amount of such cumulative calendar year-to-date net income. 
  In the event the Bank sustains a Net Loss for a calendar year, any such Net Loss first shall be applied to reduce Retained Earnings that are not Restricted Retained  
  
     - 26 - 

Earnings until such Retained Earnings are reduced to zero, and thereafter any remaining portion of the Net Loss for the calendar year may be applied to reduce Restricted Retained Earnings. 
  (iv)        Funding at the Special Contribution Amount  .  If during a Dividend Restriction Period, the amount of the Bank s Restricted Retained Earnings decreases in any calendar quarter, except as provided in   Sections X.2.b.iii.A. and X.2.b.iii.B.x.   above, the Bank shall allocate the Special Contribution Amount to its Restricted Retained Earnings account beginning at the following calendar quarter-end (except as provided in the last sentence of this subsection). Thereafter, the Bank shall continue to allocate the Special Contribution Amount to its Restricted Retained Earnings account until the cumulative difference between: (A) the allocations made using the Special Contribution Amount; and (B) the allocations that would have been made if the Regular Contribution Amount applied, is equal to the amount of the prior decrease in the amount of its Restricted Retained Earnings account arising from the application of   Section X.2.b.iii.B.y  .  If at any calendar quarter-end the allocation of the Special Contribution Amount would result in a cumulative allocation in excess of such prior decrease in the amount of Restricted Retained Earnings: (x) the Bank may allocate such percentage of Quarterly Net Income to the Restricted Retained Earnings account that shall exactly restore the amount of the prior decrease, plus the amount of the Regular Contribution Amount for that quarter; and (y) the Bank in subsequent quarters shall revert to paying at least the Regular Contribution Amount. 
  (v)        Release of Restricted Retained Earnings  .  If the Bank s RREM decreases from time to time due to fluctuations in the Bank s Total Consolidated Obligations, amounts in the Restricted Retained Earnings account in excess of 150 percent of the RREM may be released by the Bank from the restrictions otherwise imposed on such amounts pursuant to the provisions of the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment, and reallocated to its Retained Earnings that are not Restricted Retained Earnings. Until the Restriction Termination Date, the Bank may not otherwise reallocate amounts in its Restricted Retained Earnings account (provided that a reduction in the Restricted Retained Earnings account following a Net Loss pursuant to subsection (iii) above is not a reallocation). 
  (vi)        No Effect on Rights of Shareholders as Owners of Retained Earnings  .  In the event of the liquidation of the Bank, or a taking of the Bank s Retained Earnings by any future federal action, nothing in the Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment shall change the rights of the holders of the Bank s Class B Stock that confer ownership of Retained Earnings, including Restricted Retained Earnings, as granted under Section 6(h) of the Act. 
   
  3.        Limitation on Dividends, Stock Purchase and Stock Redemption  .   
  
     - 27 - 

a.        General Rule on Dividends  .  From the REFCORP Termination Date through the Restriction Termination Date, the Bank may not pay Dividends, or otherwise reallocate funds (except as expressly provided in   Section X.2.b.v.  , and further provided that a reduction in the Restricted Retained Earnings account following a Net Loss pursuant to   Section X.2.b.iii.   is not a reallocation), out of Restricted Retained Earnings.  During a Dividend Restriction Period, the Bank may not pay Dividends out of the amount of Quarterly Net Income required to be allocated to Restricted Retained Earnings.   
  b.        Limitations on Repurchase and Redemption  .  From the REFCORP Termination Date through the Restriction Termination Date, the Bank shall not engage in a repurchase or redemption transaction if following such transaction the Bank s Total Capital as reported to the Finance Agency falls below the Bank s aggregate paid-in amount of capital stock. 
   
  4.        Termination of Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment Obligations  .   
  a.        Notice of Automatic Termination Event  . 
  (i)        Action by FHLBanks  .  If the Bank desires to assert that an Automatic Termination Event has occurred (or will occur on the effective date of a change in a statute or the Regulations), the Bank shall provide prompt written notice to all of the other FHLBanks (and provide a copy to the Finance Agency) identifying the specific statutory or regulatory change that is the basis for the assertion.  For the purposes of this section,  prompt written notice  means notice delivered no later than 90 calendar days subsequent to: (A) the date the specific statutory change takes effect; or (B) the date an interim final rule or final rule effecting the specific regulatory change is published in the Federal Register.  
  If within 60 calendar days of transmission of such written notice to all of the other FHLBanks, at least two-thirds (2/3) of the then existing FHLBanks (including the Bank) execute a Declaration of Automatic Termination concurring that the specific statutory or regulatory change identified in the written notice constitutes an Automatic Termination Event, then the Declaration of Automatic Termination shall be delivered by the Bank to the Finance Agency within 10 calendar days of the date that the Declaration of Automatic Termination is executed.  After the expiration of a 60 calendar day period that begins when the Declaration of Automatic Termination is delivered to the Finance Agency, or is delivered to the Finance Agency by another FHLBank pursuant to the terms of its capital plan, an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be deemed to occur (except as provided in   Section X.4.a.iii  . 
  If a Declaration of Automatic Termination concurring that the specific statutory or regulatory change identified in the written notice constitutes an Automatic Termination Event has not been executed by at least the required two-thirds (2/3) of the then existing FHLBanks within 60 calendar days of transmission of such  
  
     - 28 - 

notice to all of the other FHLBanks, the Bank may request a determination from the Finance Agency that the specific statutory or regulatory change constitutes an Automatic Termination Event.  Such request must be filed with the Finance Agency within 10 calendar days after the expiration of the 60 calendar day period that begins upon transmission of the written notice of the basis of the assertion to all of the other FHLBanks.   
  (ii)        Action by Finance Agency  .  The Bank may request a determination from the Finance Agency that a specific statutory or regulatory change constitutes an Automatic Termination Event and may claim that an Automatic Termination Event has occurred, or will occur, with respect to a specific statutory or regulatory change only if the Bank has complied with the time limitations and procedures of   Section X.4.a.i  .   
  If within 60 calendar days after the Bank delivers such a request to the Finance Agency, or another FHLBank delivers such a request pursuant to its capital plan, the Finance Agency provides the requesting FHLBank with a written determination that a specific statutory or regulatory change is an Automatic Termination Event, then an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be deemed to occur as of the expiration of such 60 calendar day period (except as provided in   Section X.4.a.iii  ). The date of the Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be as of the expiration of such 60 calendar day period (except as provided in   Section X.4.a.iii  ) no matter on which day prior to the expiration of the 60 calendar day period the Finance Agency has provided its written determination.  
  If the Finance Agency fails to make a determination within 60 calendar days after an FHLBank delivers such request to the Finance Agency, then an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be deemed to occur as of the date of the expiration of such 60 calendar day period (except as provided in subsection X.4.a.iii.); provided, however, that the Finance Agency may make a written request for information from that FHLBank, and toll such 60 calendar day period from the date that the Finance Agency transmits its request until that FHLBank delivers to the Finance Agency information responsive to its request.  
  If within 60 calendar days after an FHLBank delivers to the Finance Agency a request for determination that a specific statutory or regulatory change constitutes an Automatic Termination Event (or such longer period if the 60 calendar day period is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence), the Finance Agency provides that FHLBank with a written determination that a specific statutory or regulatory change is not an Automatic Termination Event, then an Automatic Termination Event shall not have occurred with respect to such change. 
  (iii)        Proviso as to Occurrence of Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date  .  In no case under this   Section X.4.a.   may an Automatic  
  
     - 29 - 

Termination Event Declaration Date be deemed to occur prior to: (A) the date the specific statutory change takes effect; or (B) the date an interim final rule or final rule effecting the specific regulatory change is published in the Federal Register. 
  b.        Notice of Voluntary Termination  .  If the FHLBanks terminate the Agreement, then the FHLBanks shall provide written notice to the Finance Agency that the FHLBanks have voted to terminate the Agreement.  
  c.        Consequences of an Automatic Termination Event or Vote to Terminate the Agreement  .   
  (i)        Consequences of Voluntary Termination  .  In the event the FHLBanks deliver written notice to the Finance Agency that the FHLBanks have voted to terminate the Agreement, then without any further action by the Bank or the Finance Agency: (A) the date of delivery of such notice shall be an Allocation Termination Date; and (B) one year from the date of delivery of such notice shall be a Restriction Termination Date.   
  (ii)        Consequences of an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date  .  If an Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date has occurred, then without further action by the Bank or the Finance Agency: (A) the date of the Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be an Allocation Termination Date; and (B) one year from the date of the Automatic Termination Event Declaration Date shall be a Restriction Termination Date.   
  (iii)        Deletion of Operative Provisions of Retained Earnings Capital Plan Amendment  .  Without any further action by the Bank or the Finance Agency, on the Restriction Termination Date, this Article X of the Capital Plan shall be deleted.

Capital Plan of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati      Schedule A Relating to   Section VI.4.a.i.  :  Membership Stock 
  Illustrative Allocations of Membership Stock Among Members 
             
    The total amount of required Membership Stock shall be determined by the Bank and shall be allocated among Members based on a range of percentages applied to each Member s Total Assets, subject, however, to a minimum Membership Stock investment requirement of no less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) or more than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and a maximum Membership Stock investment requirement of no less than Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) or more than Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000).  
                
    Illustrative minimum and maximum Membership Stock investment requirements follow: 
     Minimum -- $1,000 (One Thousand Dollars)      Maximum -- $100,000,000 (One Hundred Million Dollars)* 
             
    The range of percentages shall vary inversely with the amount of each Members  Total Assets.  Such percentages shall vary from three-tenths of one percent (0.30%) to three-hundredths of one percent (0.03%). 
                
    An illustrative range of percentages follows: 

The amount of Membership Stock computed from applying the range of percentages is cumulative.  For example, a Member with Total Assets of $60.0 billion shall be required to hold Membership Stock as the sum of (i) the first $25.0 billion of Total Assets at a rate of 0.12 percent, (ii) the next $25.0 billion of Total Assets at a rate of 0.10 percent, and (iii) the last $10.0 billion of Total Assets at a rate of 0.07 percent.  Such Member would be required to hold $69.5 million of Membership Stock.*  
     *  The Maximum Membership Stock requirement was reduced by Board of Directors  action to Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) effective November 28   th   , 2011.  The previous Maximum Membership Stock requirement was Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and became effective August 16   th   , 2010.  The current investment requirement for any Member with Total Assets in excess of $20.8 billion will be limited by the Maximum. 
  **  The first tier of the Percentage for Membership Stock Allocation was reduced by the Board of Directors  action to 0.12 percent effective April 17   th   , 2015. 

If the maximum Membership Stock requirement is $100.0 million and the range of percentages is as given in the illustration above, any Member with Total Assets of $125.0 billion or greater would be required to hold the maximum of $100.0 million in Membership Stock.   
     Provision for Determination of Membership Stock Amount 
  The examples above are illustrative only.  As specified in Article VI,   Section 4.a.i.  , the actual range of percentages and minimum and maximum Membership Stock investment requirements shall be announced by the Bank s Board of Directors with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to all Members.

           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and  
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
       
           (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
