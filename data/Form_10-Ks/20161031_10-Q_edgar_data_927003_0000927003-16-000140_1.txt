           NOTE 1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("we," "us," "our," "Advanced Energy," or the "Company") design, manufacture, sell, and support power conversion products that transform electrical  power into various usable forms. Our products enable manufacturing processes that use thin films for various products, such as semiconductor devices, flat panel displays, solar cells, architectural glass, optical coating and decorative and functional coating for consumer products. We also supply thermal instrumentation products for advanced temperature control in the thin film process for these same markets. Our power control modules provide power control solutions for industrial applications where heat treatment and processing are used such as glass manufacturing, metal fabrication and treatment, and material and chemical processing. Our high voltage power supplies and modules are used in applications such as semiconductor ion implantation, scanning electron microscopy, chemical analysis such as mass spectrometry and various applications using X-ray technology and electron guns for both analytical and processing applications. Our network of global service support centers provides a recurring revenue opportunity as we offer repair services, conversions, upgrades, and refurbishments and sales of used equipment to companies using our products. As of December 31, 2015, we discontinued the production, engineering, and sales of our solar inverter product line. As such, all solar inverter revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are reported in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented herein. See   Note 2. Discontinued Operations. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of our operations and cash flows for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and other financial information filed with the SEC. 
  ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
  The preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when accounting for items and matters such as allowances for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, warranty reserves, acquisitions, asset valuations, goodwill, asset life, depreciation, amortization, recoverability of assets, impairments, deferred revenue, stock option and restricted stock grants, taxes, and other provisions are reasonable, based upon information available at the time they are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Our accounting policies are described in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ). Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (in thousands except per share data) 

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers, which implements a five step process for how an entity should recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing reporting. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead of separating into current and noncurrent amounts. This guidance is effective for the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted for all companies in any interim or annual period. We are not planning on early adoption. Based on our current assessment, we have determined that as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the result of adoption would be the reclassification of approximately   $20.3 million   and   $20.3 million  , respectively, from current assets to non-current assets. Of these amounts,   $14.3 million   and   $14.3 million  , respectively, would have been reflected in discontinued operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures related to leasing transactions. The standard is effective for the first quarter of 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a change in the accounting of share-based payments, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classifications of awards and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted for all companies in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
   
           NOTE 2. 
    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
     In December 2015, we completed the wind down of engineering, manufacturing and sales of our solar inverter product line (the "inverter business"). Accordingly, the results of our inverter business has been reflected as  Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes  on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented herein.  
  The effect of our sales of extended inverter warranties to our customers continues to be reflected in deferred revenue in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Deferred revenue for extended inverter warranties and the associated costs of warranty service will be reflected in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively, from continuing operations in future periods in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, as the deferred revenue is earned and the associated services are rendered. Extended warranties related to the inverter product line are no longer offered.  
  The items included in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" are as follows:

     Table of Contents             
  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (in thousands except per share data) 

Assets and Liabilities of discontinued operations within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of the following: 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we reclassified   $5 million   of income tax receivable from Accounts and other receivables, net reflected in discontinued operations to Income tax receivable reflected in continuing operations. 
   
           NOTE 3. 
    INCOME TAXES 
     The following table sets out the tax expense and the effective tax rate for our income from continuing operations:   

  The effective tax rates for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates.  
  Our policy is to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount of interest and penalties accrued related to our unrecognized tax benefits was not significant. 
   
           NOTE 4. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
     Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of our diluted EPS is similar to the computation of our basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have

been outstanding (using the if-converted and treasury stock methods), if our outstanding stock options and restricted stock units had been converted to common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive.     
  The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS:   

  The following stock options and restricted stock units were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive:   

Stock Buyback 
  In September 2015 our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to   $150.0 million   of our stock over a thirty-month period. As of October 28, 2016, we have $100 million remaining available for the repurchase of shares.  In November 2015 we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase arrangement with Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC (the  Counterparty ) pursuant to a Fixed Dollar Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction (the  ASR Agreement ) to purchase   $50.0 million   of shares of our common stock in the open market. In accordance with the ASR Agreement, we paid   $50.0 million   at the beginning of the contract and received an initial delivery of   1.4 million   shares of our common stock.  In April 2016, we received a final delivery of   0.3 million   shares of our common stock.  A total of   1.7 million   shares of our common stock was repurchased under the ASR Agreement at an average price of   $28.99   per share.  We retired the shares repurchased under the ASR Agreement and have therefore recognized the   $50.0 million   share repurchase as a reduction to Stockholders Equity. 
   
           NOTE 5. 
    MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE 
     Our investments with original maturities of more than three months at time of purchase and that are intended to be held for no more than 12 months, are considered marketable securities available for sale. 
  Our marketable securities consist of commercial paper and certificates of deposit as follows:

     Table of Contents             
  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (in thousands except per share data) 

The maturities of our marketable securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

The value and liquidity of the marketable securities we hold are affected by market conditions, as well as the ability of the issuers of such securities to make principal and interest payments when due, and the functioning of the markets in which these securities are traded. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe any of the underlying issuers of our marketable securities are at risk of default. 
  The following tables present information about our marketable securities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The tables indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine fair value. We did not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
   
           NOTE 6. 
    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
     We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward currency exchange rate contracts. During the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we entered into currency exchange rate forward contracts to attempt to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  We did not enter into any currency exchange rate forward contracts during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; however, they tend to offset the fluctuations of our intercompany debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes. These forward contracts are typically for one month periods. We did not have any currency exchange rate contracts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015   we had outstanding Euro forward contracts.  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   the gains and losses recorded related to the foreign currency exchange contracts are as follows: 

These gains and losses were offset by corresponding gains and losses on the revaluation of the underlying intercompany debt and both are included as a component of Other income, net, in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

  Other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

Amortization expense relating to other intangible assets included in our income from continuing operations is as follows: 

Amortization expense related to intangibles for each of the five years   2016   (remaining) through 2020 and thereafter is as follows: 

Provisions of our sales agreements include customary product warranties, ranging from   12   months to   24   months following installation. The estimated cost of warranties is recorded when revenue is recognized and is based upon historical experience by product, configuration and geographic region.

We establish accruals for our warranty obligations that are probable to result in future costs. The warranty accrual is included in our Other accrued expenses in our balance sheet. Changes in our product warranty accrual are as follows: 

NOTE 12. 
    PENSION LIABILITY 
     In connection with the HiTek acquisition on April 12, 2014, we acquired the HiTek Power Limited Pension Scheme ("HPLPS"). The HPLPS has been closed to new participants and additional accruals since 2006. In order to measure the expense and related benefit obligation, various assumptions are made including discount rates used to value the obligation, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses and estimated future inflation rates. These assumptions are based on historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. An actuarial analysis is used to measure the expense and liability associated with pension benefits. We have committed to fund our defined benefit obligation of HPLPS in the amount of approximately   $1.0 million   per year through 2024. 
  The net pension liability is included in Other long-term liabilities in our balance sheet as follows:   

  The components of the net periodic pension expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

NOTE 13. 
    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
     We have reserved a total of   3.0 million   shares of Advanced Energy s common stock for issuance under the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units (including deferred stock units), unrestricted stock, and dividend equivalent rights.  Any of the awards issued under this Plan may be issued as performance based awards to align compensation awards to the attainment of annual or long-term performance goals. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   1.9 million   shares available for grant under the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
  Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant and have either a time based vesting schedule of three or four-years, or a performance based vesting schedule based upon achievement

     Table of Contents             
  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (in thousands except per share data) 

of organizational performance goals over a three year period, and a term of 10 years. The fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. 
  Restricted stock units ( RSU s ) are granted with either a time based vesting schedule of three or four-years, or a performance based vesting schedule based upon achievement of organizational performance goals over a three year period. The fair value of each RSU is determined based upon the closing fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. 
  We recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards issued and the functional area of the employee receiving the award. Stock-based compensation for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

A summary of activity for stock option awards during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is as follows:   

  The assumptions in the following table were used to determine fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model.   

  The expected term represents the period of time the stock options awarded are expected to be outstanding, based upon the historical experience of the plan participants.  Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility using daily stock price observations.  The estimated dividend yield is based on historical dividend practice and the market value of our common stock.  The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve, for periods within the contractual life of the stock option at the time of award.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     We have firm purchase commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components.  The obligation as of   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $54.4 million  . Our policy with respect to all purchase commitments is to record losses, if any, when they are probable and reasonably estimable. We continuously monitor these commitments for exposure to potential losses and will record a provision for losses when it is deemed necessary.  
  We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business. There have been no material developments in legal proceedings in which we are involved during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Results of Continuing Operations 
  The following table sets forth certain data, and the percentage of sales each item reflects, derived from our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:   

  SALES 
  The following tables set forth sales, and percentage of sales, by product group for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Total Sales 
  Sales   increased     $16.8 million  , or   15.3%  , to   $126.6 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $109.8 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $20.4 million  , or   6.2%  , to   $348.4 million   from   $327.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    Sales in the semiconductor market   increased     $8.3 million  , or   11.4%   for the   three months   ending   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  Semiconductor market sales for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015     increased     $13.2 million   or 6.1% as compared to the same period in 2015.  Our growth in the semiconductor market has been fueled by our leadership  
  
    19 

     Table Of Contents  

in etch applications, specifically related to advanced memory and transition to 3DNAND, along with advances in logic technology.  Sales growth in each of the periods is driven primarily by recent program wins which have moved into production and delivery. 
  Sales in the industrial power capital equipment markets   increased     $5.1 million  , or   23.9%   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily from flat panel display applications.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   sales   increased     $2.2 million   or   3.5%   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The industrial markets we serve include solar panel, flat panel display, power control modules, data storage, architectural glass, high voltage and other industrial manufacturing markets.  Our customers in these markets are primarily global and regional original equipment manufacturers. 
  Global service sales   increased   $3.4 million, or   21.8%  , for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  Global service sales for the   nine months   ending   September 30, 2016   increased $5.0 million, or 10.3% as compared to the same period in 2015.  Increased global service sales in both periods was due to share gains and growth in the  installed base.  
  Backlog 
  Our backlog was   $56.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $43.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Backlog remains strong primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor market. 
  GROSS PROFIT 
  For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , gross profit was   $66.1 million  , or   52.2%   of sales as compared to gross profit of   $58.5 million  , or   53.3%   of sales, for the same period in 2015. Gross profit for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was $181.6 million, or 52.1% of sales, as compared to gross profit of $174.2 million, or 53.1% of sales, for the same period in 2015.  The increase in gross profit for both periods is attributable to increased volume as the semiconductor capital equipment market remains strong.  The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for both periods is attributable to product mix.  
  OPERATING EXPENSE 
  Operating expenses increased $3.4 million to $  31.8 million  , or   25.1%   of sales, for the three months ending   September 30, 2016   from   $28.4 million  , or   25.8%   of sales for the same period in 2015.  Operating expenses increased $9.6 million to   $93.3 million  , or   26.8%   of sales, for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $83.7 million   or   25.5%   of sales for the same period in 2015.   
  The following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated:   

  Research and Development 
  We perform research and development of products for new or emerging applications, technological changes to provide higher performance, lower cost, or other attributes that we may expect to advance our customers  products. We believe that continued development of technological applications, as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements, are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, and we expect these investments to continue.  
  Research and development expenses increased $0.9 million to   $11.3 million  , or   8.9%   of sales, for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $10.4 million  , or   9.4%   of sales, for the same period in   2015  . Research and development expenses increased $3.2 million to   $33.3 million  , or   9.6%   of sales, for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $30.1 million  , or  
  
    20 

     Table Of Contents  

9.2%   of sales, for the same period in 2015. The increase in research and development expense is due to our investment in new programs to maintain and increase our technological leadership.  
  Selling, General and Administrative 
  Our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel, trade shows, advertising, third-party sales representative commissions, and other selling and marketing activities. Our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate, legal, tax, financial, governance, administrative, information systems, and human resource functions in addition to our general management, including acquisition-related activities. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased     $2.8 million   to   $19.4 million  , or   15.4%   of sales for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $16.6 million  , or   15.1%   of sales, in the same period in   2015  . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $6.8 million   to   $56.8 million  , or   16.3%   of sales, for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $50.0 million  , or   15.2%   of sales in the same period in 2015. The increase in both periods is primarily driven by higher sales expense as we expand our sales management and marketing team to support our growth diversification and geographical expansion plans, as well as, higher stock-based compensation expense,  professional fees and costs associated with acquisition opportunities.  
  Other Income (Expense), net 
  Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on sales of fixed assets, and other miscellaneous items. Other income (expense), net was a   loss   of   $0.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to a   loss   of   $0.7 million   for the same period in 2015.  Other income (expense), net was a gain of $1.1 and $0.4  million for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase in gain for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and our assets in different countries. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  We recorded an income tax provision for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $5.3 million   and   $12.9 million  , respectively, compared to   $6.1 million   and   $18.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Effective tax rates are   15.4%   and   14.5%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   20.8%   and   20.8%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  The effective tax rates for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly. 
  Results of Discontinued Operations 
  We completed the wind down of our inverter engineering, manufacturing and sales product line in December 2015. Accordingly, the inverter product line is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented herein.  Extended warranties previously sold for the inverter product line are reflected in deferred revenue from continuing operations on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be reflected in continuing operations in future periods as the deferred revenue is earned and the associated services are rendered.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes are as follows: 

Operating income (loss) from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ending   September 30, 2016   reflects the recovery of accounts receivable previously reserved for product warranties. 
  Non-GAAP Results 
  Management uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate business performance without the impacts of certain non-cash charges and other charges which are not part of our usual operations.  We use these non-GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives, make business decisions, including developing budgets and forecasting future periods.  In addition, management's incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. However, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
  The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and restructuring charges, as well as acquisition-related costs and other nonrecurring costs, as they are not indicative of future performance.  The tax effect of our non-GAAP adjustments represents the anticipated annual tax rate applied to each non-GAAP adjustment after consideration of their respective book and tax treatments.

Impact of Inflation 
  In recent years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations. However, we continuously monitor operating price increases, particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process. To the extent permitted by competition, we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time. From time to time, we may also receive pressure from customers to decrease sales prices due to reductions in the cost structure of our products from cost improvement initiatives and decreases in component part prices.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  LIQUIDITY 
  We believe that adequate liquidity and cash generation is important to the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our ability to fund our operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and product development efforts may depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash, investments, and cash generated from current operations. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $249.8 million   in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that our current and available cash levels, as well as our cash flows from future operations, will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, levels of capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for the next twelve months. We may seek additional financing from time to time.  
  In September 2015 our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to   $150.0 million   of our stock over a thirty-month period. As of October 28, 2016, we have $100 million remaining available for the repurchase of shares.  In November 2015 we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase arrangement with Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC (the  Counterparty ) pursuant to a Fixed Dollar Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction (the  ASR Agreement ) to purchase   $50.0 million   of shares of our common stock in the open market. In accordance with the ASR Agreement, we paid   $50.0 million   at the beginning of the contract and received an initial delivery of   1.4 million   shares of our common stock.  In April 2016, we received a final delivery of   0.3 million   shares of our common stock.  A total of   1.7 million   shares of our common stock was repurchased under the ASR Agreement at an average price of   $28.99   per share.

CASH FLOWS 
  A summary of our cash provided by and (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is as follows:   

  2016   CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO   2015    
  Net cash provided by operating activities    
    Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $77.5 million  , compared to   $72.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   of   $5.4 million   in net cash flows from operating activities is the result a $27.5 million decrease in cash flow produced by continuing operations off set by a $32.9 million decrease in cash used by the discontinued operations.  The $27.5 million decrease in cash flows produced by continuing operations was largely caused by the usage of working capital including an increase to accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory.  The reduction of cash used by discontinued operations was due to decreased operating activities as the Company continues to wind down the inverter business.  
  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities    
  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $16.9 million   from   $(15.0) million   used in the same period in   2015  . The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by reduced purchases of marketable securities, coupled with the maturity of marketable securities during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Net cash provided by financing activities    
  Net cash provided by financing activities in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.3 million  , a   $1.7 million   decrease from the cash provided by financing activities of   $4.1 million   in the same period of   2015   and was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises.  
  Effect of currency translation on cash 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , currency translation had a   $0.6 million   unfavorable impact  compared to a   $2.1 million   unfavorable impact of in the same period of   2015  . Our foreign operations primarily sell product and incur expenses in the related local currency. Exchange rate fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result  
  
    24 

     Table Of Contents  

in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. The functional currencies of our worldwide operations include U.S. dollar ("USD"), Canadian Dollar ("CAD"), Swiss Franc ("CHF"), Chinese Yuan ("CNY"), Euro ("EUR"), Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Indian Rupee ("INR"), Japanese Yen ("JPY"), South Korean Won ("KRW"), and New Taiwan Dollar ("TWD"). Our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in USD, CNY, EUR, and JPY. The change in these key currency rates during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.   Note 1. Operation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates   to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates, discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , include estimates for allowances for doubtful accounts, determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization, the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, assessing the need for impairment charges for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, establishing warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes, and assessing excess and obsolete inventories. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these estimates. 
    Our management discusses the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually. Our management also internally discusses the adoption of new accounting policies or changes to existing policies at interim dates, as it deems necessary or appropriate. 
   
           ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     Interest Rate Risk 
  Our market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio and credit facility. We generally place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our investments consisted of certificates of deposit, with maturities of less than 2 years (see   Note 5. Marketable Securities and Assets Measured at Fair Value   in ITEM 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements"). As a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio and assuming that our investment portfolio balances remain constant, a hypothetical decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by approximately   $0.1 million  . 
  As of September 9, 2016 we terminated our Credit Facility with Wells Fargo. As such, we had no debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   (see   Note 17. Credit Facilities   in ITEM 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements") that would be subject to change in interest rates.  
  
    25 

     Table Of Contents  

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products and purchase materials in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred. Our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in the USD, EUR, JPY, and CNY. As these currencies fluctuate against each other, and other currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales, purchasing transactions and labor. 
  Our reported financial results of operations, including the reported value of our assets and liabilities, are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of many of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period. Operating results and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange during each reporting period. Although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact, the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity, and overall value of our net assets. 
  From time to time, we enter into foreign currency exchange rate contracts with banks to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date. Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments. We enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
  Currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the USD while another currency weakens. Because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels, it is difficult to quantify the impact of a change in one or more particular exchange rates. 
  See the "Risk Factors" set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for more information about the market risks to which we are exposed. There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from   December 31, 2015  . 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer (Yuval Wasserman, Chief Executive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer (Thomas Liguori, Chief Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . The conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer from this evaluation were communicated to the Audit Committee. We intend to continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

           ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business.  
  There have been no material developments in legal proceedings in which we are involved during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . For a description of previously reported legal proceedings refer to Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
           ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any of which could cause our results to be adversely impacted and could result in a decline in the value or loss of an investment in our common stock. Other factors may also exist that we cannot anticipate or that we currently do not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future results. Such risks and uncertainties may also impact the accuracy of forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  We generally have no long-term contracts with our customers requiring them to purchase any specified quantities from us. 
  Our sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and we generally have no long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which is typical in the industries we serve. As a result, we are limited in our ability to predict the level of future sales or commitments from our current customers, which may diminish our ability to allocate labor, materials, and equipment in the manufacturing process effectively. In addition, we may purchase inventory in anticipation of sales that do not materialize, resulting in excess and obsolete inventory write-offs. 
  The industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. 
  As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar, industrial and related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers  manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers  products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers  purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. We may be required to record significant reserves for excess and obsolete inventory as demand for our products changes. 
  To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
  Market pressures and increased low-cost competition may reduce or eliminate our profitability. 
  Our customers continually exert pressure on us to reduce our prices and extend payment terms. Given the nature of our customer base and the highly competitive markets in which we compete, we may be required to reduce our prices or extend payment terms to remain competitive. We have recently seen pricing pressure from our largest customers due in part to low-cost competition and market consolidation. As a result of the competitive markets we serve, from time to time we may enter into long term pricing agreements with our largest customers that results in reduced product pricing. Such reduced product pricing may result in product margin declines unless we are successful in reducing our product costs ahead of such price reductions. We believe some of our Asian competitors benefit from local governmental funding incentives and purchasing preferences from end-user customers in their respective countries. Moreover, in order to be successful in the current competitive environment, we are required to accelerate our investment in research   development to meet time-to-market, performance and technology adoption cycle needs of our customers simply in order to compete for design wins, and if successful, receive potential purchase orders. Given such up-front investments we have to make and the competitive nature of our markets, we may not be able to reduce our expenses in an amount  
  
    27 

     Table Of Contents  

sufficient to offset potential margin declines or loss of business, and may not be able to meet customer product time-line expectations. The potential decrease in cash flow could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. 
  A significant portion of our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated among a few customers. 
  Our 10 largest customers account for   65.6%   of our sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   61.2%   and   59.7%   of our sales for the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Our sales to Applied Materials, Inc. account for   34.0%   of our sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   29.8%   and   29.8%   of our sales for the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and had accounts receivable balance of   $29.4 million   and   $17.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our sales to LAM Research account for   21.0%   of our sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   20.3%   and   19.9%   of our sales for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and had accounts receivable balance of   $10.0 million   and   $7.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. A significant decline in sales from any or all of these customers, or the Company's inability to collect on these sales, could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  
  Our competitive position could be weakened if we are unable to convince end users to specify that our products be used in the equipment sold by our customers. 
  The end users in our markets may direct equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier s product in their equipment at a particular facility. This occurs with frequency because our products are critical in manufacturing process control for thin-film applications. Our success, therefore, depends in part on our ability to have end users specify that our products be used at their facilities. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors that already have a large installed base of products within such facilities. 
  We must achieve design wins to retain our existing customers and to obtain new customers, although design wins achieved do not necessarily result in substantial sales. 
  The constantly changing nature of technology in the markets we serve causes equipment manufacturers to continually design new systems. We must work with these manufacturers early in their design cycles to modify our equipment or design new equipment to meet the requirements of their new systems. Manufacturers typically choose one or two vendors to provide the components for use with the early system shipments. Selection as one of these vendors is called a design win. It is critical that we achieve these design wins in order to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers. 
  We believe that equipment manufacturers often select their suppliers based on factors including long-term relationships and end user demand. Accordingly, we may have difficulty achieving design wins from equipment manufacturers who are not currently our customers. In addition, we must compete for design wins for new systems and products of our existing customers, including those with whom we have had long-term relationships. Our efforts to achieve design wins are time consuming, expensive, and may not be successful. If we are not successful in achieving design wins, or if we do achieve design wins but our customers  systems that utilize our products are not successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. 
  Once a manufacturer chooses a component for use in a particular product, it is likely to retain that component for the life of that product. Our sales and growth could experience material and prolonged adverse effects if we fail to achieve design wins. However, design wins do not always result in substantial sales, as sales of our products are dependent upon our customers  sales of their products. 
  Changes in tax laws, tax rates, or mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions in which we do business, could impact our future tax liabilities and related corporate profitability 
  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard.

For example, on Oct. 5, 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued the final report on all 15 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  BEPS  Action Plans. According to the OECD, the current rules have created opportunities for Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, and suggest new rules whereby profits are taxed where economic activities take place and value is created. OECD comments include new or reinforced international standards as well as concrete measures to help countries tackle BEPS. Among the highlights of the OECD Final Reports are the new transfer pricing approach and reinforced international standards on tax treaties, the setting of minimum standards on harmful tax practices, treaty abuse, country-by-country reporting and dispute resolution, action items requiring national legislation particularly in hybrid mismatches and interest restriction, and analytical reports with recommendations concerning digital economy and multilateral instruments. If countries in which we operate adopt the OECD recommendations as outlined in the BEPS Action Plans, it is uncertain to what extent the changes could impact the Company. 
  Our legacy inverter products may suffer higher than anticipated damage or warranty claims. 
  Our legacy inverter products (of which we discontinued the manufacture, engineering, and sale in December 2015 and which are reflected as Discontinued Operations in this filing) contain components that may contain errors or defects and were sold with original product warranties ranging from one to ten years with an option to purchase additional warranty coverage for up to 20 years. If any of our products are defective or fail because of their design, we might be required to repair, redesign or recall those products, pay damages (including liquidated damages) or warranty claims, and we could suffer significant harm to our reputation. We accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in additional expenses in the line "Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  on our Consolidated Statement of Operations in future periods. We plan to continue supporting inverter customers with service maintenance and repair operations.  This includes performing service to fulfill obligations under existing service maintenance contracts. There is no certainty that these can be performed profitably and could be adversely affected by higher than anticipated product failure rates, loss of critical service technician skills, an inability to obtain service parts, customer demands and disputes and cost of repair parts, among other factors. See   Note 2. Discontinued Operations   in Part I, Item 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein. 
  Our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to damage or warranty claims. 
  Our products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective or fail because of their design, we might be required to repair, redesign or recall those products, pay damages (including liquidated damages) or warranty claims, and we could suffer significant harm to our reputation. We accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit. In recent years, we have experienced increased warranty costs for our legacy inverter product lines, which is reflected in discontinued operations. See   Note 2. Discontinued Operations   in Part I, Item 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein. 
  Deterioration of demand for our inverter services could negatively impact our business. 
  Our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global demand for our inverter service repair capabilities. Any such changes could adversely affect the carrying amount of our inverter service inventories, thereby negatively affecting our financial results from Continuing Operations. 
  We maintain significant amounts of cash in international locations. 
  Given the global nature of our business, we have both domestic and international concentrations of cash and investments. The value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, we could incur a significant impairment of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.  
  Like many multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties. Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused  
  
    29 

     Table Of Contents  

by unauthorized access or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC. Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations. In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
  If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. 
  As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system. While our system is designed with access security, unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached by intentional misconduct by computer hackers, as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. 
  We conduct manufacturing at only a few sites and our sites are not generally interchangeable. 
  Our power products for the semiconductor industry are manufactured in Shenzhen, PRC. Our high voltage products are manufactured in Ronkonkoma, New York, Littlehampton, United Kingdom and Shenzhen, PRC. Our thermal instrumentation products that are used in the semiconductor industry are manufactured in Vancouver, Washington. Each facility is under operating lease and interruptions in operations could be caused by early termination of existing leases by landlords or failure by landlords to renew existing leases upon expiration, including the possibility that suitable operating locations may not be available in proximity to existing facilities which could result in labor or supply chain risks. For instance, our Shenzhen, PRC manufacturing facility currently has a lease which expires in July 2017 that we are actively working on and expect to extend. Each facility manufactures different products, and therefore, is not interchangeable. Natural or other uncontrollable occurrences at any of our manufacturing facilities could significantly reduce our productivity at such site and could prevent us from meeting our customers  requirements in a timely manner, or at all. Our losses from any such occurrence could significantly affect our operations and results of operations for a prolonged period of time. 
  Our restructuring and other cost-reduction efforts in prior years have included transitioning manufacturing operations to our facility in Shenzhen from other manufacturing facilities, such as Fort Collins, Colorado and Littlehampton, United Kingdom, which renders us increasingly reliant upon our Shenzhen facility. A disruption in manufacturing at our Shenzhen facility, from whatever cause, could have a significantly adverse effect on our ability to fulfill customer orders, our ability to maintain customer relationships, our costs to manufacture our products and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. 
  We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
  Our operations in the People s Republic of China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties over which we have little or no control and we may be unable to alter our business practice in time to avoid reductions in revenues. 
  A significant portion of our operations outside the United States are located in the PRC, which exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in customs regulations, changes in tax policies, changes in PRC laws and regulations, possible expropriation or other PRC government actions, and unsettled political conditions including potential changes in U.S. policy regarding overseas manufacturing. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Please see   "We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy"   risk factor below.

The PRC s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, rate of growth, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the economy of the PRC has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and amongst various economic sectors of the PRC. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Strikes by workers and picketing in front of the factory gates of certain companies in Shenzhen have caused unrest among some workers seeking higher wages, which could impact our manufacturing facility in Shenzhen. While some of the government's measures may benefit the overall economy of the PRC, they may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us as well as work stoppages. 
  We transitioned a significant amount of our supply base to Asian suppliers. 
  We transitioned the purchasing of a substantial portion of components for our thin film products to Asian suppliers to lower our materials costs and shipping expenses. These components might require us to incur higher than anticipated testing or repair costs, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Customers who have strict and extensive qualification requirements might not accept our products if these lower-cost components do not meet their requirements. A delay or refusal by our customers to accept such products, as well as an inability of our suppliers to meet our purchasing requirements, might require us to purchase higher-priced components from our existing suppliers or might cause us to lose sales to these customers, either of which could lead to decreased revenue and gross margins and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  
  Our evolving manufacturing footprint may increase our risk. 
  The nature of our manufacturing is evolving as we continue to grow by acquisition. Historically, our principal manufacturing location was in China; however, we have also added specialized manufacturing at our Littlehampton, United Kingdom and Ronkonkoma, New York facilities. From time to time we may migrate manufacturing of specific products between facilities or to third party manufacturers. If we do not successfully coordinate the timely manufacturing and distribution of our products during this time, we may have insufficient supply of products to meet customer demand, we could lose sales, we may experience a build-up in inventory, or we may incur additional costs. 
  Raw material, part, component, and subassembly shortages, exacerbated by our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, could affect our ability to manufacture products and systems and could delay our shipments. 
  Our business depends on our ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of our customers. Our ability to timely manufacture our products depends in part on the timely delivery of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies from suppliers. We rely on sole and limited source suppliers for some of our raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies that are critical to the manufacturing of our products. 
  This reliance involves several risks, including the following: 
             
    the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts, components, or subassemblies; 
                
    supply shortages, if a sole or limited source provider ceases operations; 
                
    the need to fund the operating losses of a sole or limited source provider; 
                
    reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of raw materials and parts, components, or subassemblies; 
                
    the need to qualify alternative suppliers; 
                
    suppliers that may provide parts, components or subassemblies that are defective, contain counterfeit goods or are otherwise misrepresented to us in terms of form, fit or function; and 
                
    the inability of our suppliers to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new products. 
     Qualifying alternative suppliers could be time consuming and lead to delays in, or prevention of delivery of products to our customers, as well as increased costs. If we are unable to qualify additional suppliers and manage relationships with our existing and future suppliers successfully, if our suppliers experience financial difficulties including bankruptcy, or if our suppliers cannot meet our performance or quality specifications or timing requirements, we may experience shortages, delays, or increased costs of raw materials, parts, components, or subassemblies. This in turn could limit or prevent our ability to manufacture and ship our products, which could materially and adversely affect our relationships with our current and prospective customers and our business, financial condition, and results of operations. From time to time, our sole or limited source suppliers have given us notice that  
  
    31 

     Table Of Contents  

they are ending supply of critical parts, components, and subassemblies that are required for us to deliver product. In those cases, we have been required to make last time purchases of such supplies in advance of product demand from our customers. If we cannot qualify alternative suppliers before these end-of-life supplies are utilized in our products or legacy inverter warranty operations, we may be unable to deliver further product or legacy inverter warranty service to our customers. To mitigate the risk of not having a supply of critical parts, components, and subassemblies for our products, we proactively make additional purchases which we believe addresses such risk. 
  Our orders of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts. 
  We place orders with many of our suppliers based on our customers  quarterly forecasts and our annual forecasts. These forecasts are based on our customers  and our expectations as to demand for our products. As the quarter and the year progress, such demand can change rapidly or we may realize that our customers  expectations were overly optimistic or pessimistic, especially when industry or general economic conditions change. Orders with our suppliers cannot always be amended in response. In addition, in order to assure availability of certain components or to obtain priority pricing, we have entered into contracts with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase a specified amount of components and subassemblies each quarter, even if we are not able to use such components or subassemblies. Moreover, we have obligations to some of our customers to hold a minimum amount of finished goods in inventory, in order to fulfill just in time orders, regardless of whether the customers expect to place such orders. We currently have firm purchase commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components. See   Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies   in Part I, Item 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein. in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein for more information on our commitments. If demand for our products does not continue at current levels, we might not be able to use all of the components that we are required to purchase under these commitments and agreements, and our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory may increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If demand for our products exceeds our customers  and our forecasts, we may not be able to timely obtain sufficient raw materials, parts, components, or subassemblies, on favorable terms or at all, to fulfill the excess demand. 
  We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy. 
  Our business depends on the expansion of manufacturing capacity in our end markets and the installation base for the products we sell. In the past, severe tightening of credit markets, turmoil in the financial markets, and a weakening global economy have contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate. Some of our key markets depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty, such as that recently experienced in the PRC, exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing equipment orders. 
  Difficulties in obtaining capital and uncertain market conditions may also lead to a reduction of our sales and greater instances of nonpayment. These conditions may similarly affect our key suppliers, which could affect their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions could make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results and evaluate the risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As discussed in    Our orders of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts  ,  a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed and based, in part, on expectations of future net sales. If a sudden decrease in demand for our products from one or more customers were to occur, the inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of a shortfall in net sales on our results of operations. Conversely, if market conditions were to unexpectedly recover and demand for our products were to increase suddenly, we might not be able to respond quickly enough, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and customer relations. 
  If we are unable to adjust our business strategy successfully for some of our product lines to reflect the increasing price sensitivity on the part of our customers, our business and financial condition could be harmed. 
  Our business strategy for many of our product lines has been focused on product performance and technology innovation to provide enhanced efficiencies and productivity. As a result of recent economic conditions and changes in various markets that we serve, our customers have experienced significant cost pressures. We have observed increased price sensitivity on the part of our customers. If competition against any of our product lines should come to focus solely on price rather than on product performance and technology innovation, we will need to adjust our business strategy and product offerings accordingly, and if we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  The markets we operate in are highly competitive. 
  We face substantial competition, primarily from established companies, some of which have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we do. We expect our competitors will continue to develop new products in direct competition with ours, improve the design and performance of their products, and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. In order to remain competitive, we must improve and expand our products and product offerings. In addition, we may need to  
  
    32 

     Table Of Contents  

maintain a high level of investment in research and development and expand our sales and marketing efforts, particularly outside of the United States. We might not be able to make the technological advances and investments necessary to remain competitive. If we were unable to improve and expand our products and product offerings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  We are highly dependent on our intellectual property. 
  Our success depends significantly on our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents and non-disclosure agreements; however, we might not be able to protect our technology, and competitors might be able to develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries might not afford our intellectual property the same protections as do the laws of the United States. Our intellectual property is not protected by patents in several countries in which we do business, and we have limited patent protection in other countries, including the PRC. The cost of applying for patents in foreign countries and translating the applications into foreign languages requires us to select carefully the inventions for which we apply for patent protection and the countries in which we seek such protection. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the European Union and certain industrialized countries in Asia, including Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  The PRC commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the commercial law in the United States. Limited protection of intellectual property is available under PRC law. Consequently, manufacturing our products in the PRC may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we encounter infringements of our intellectual property in the PRC. 
  We have historically made acquisitions and divestitures. However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. In either an acquisition or a divestiture, we may be required to make fundamental changes in our ERP, business processes and tools which could disrupt our core business and harm our financial condition. 
  In the past, we have made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products, and technologies. We have also divested businesses. In the future, we could: 
             
    issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders' percentage ownership; 
                
    pay cash that would decrease our working capital; 
                
    incur debt; 
                
    assume liabilities; or 
                
    incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization. 
     Acquisitions and divestitures also involve numerous risks, including: 
             
    problems combining or separating the acquired/divested operations, systems, technologies, or products; 
                
    an inability to realize expected sales forecasts, operating efficiencies or product integration benefits; 
                
    difficulties in coordinating and integrating geographically separated personnel, organizations, systems, and facilities;

We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business. 
  Activities necessary to integrate acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated. 
  In 2014 we acquired PCM, HiTek, and UltraVolt, and we may acquire other businesses in the future. The success of such transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls process to these acquired businesses. The integration of acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first entered into the acquisition transaction. If actual integration costs are higher than amounts originally anticipated, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
  Return on investments or interest rate declines on plan investments could result in additional unfunded pension obligations for the HiTek Power pension plan. 
  We currently have unfunded obligations in the HiTek Power pension plan. The extent of future contributions to the pension plan depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate used to calculate our future obligations and the actual return on plan assets which enable future payments. We estimate future contributions to the plan using assumptions with respect to these and other items. While we are obligated to contribute   $1.0 million   per year through 2024 and our management believes that these assumptions are appropriate, changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions. Additionally, a material deterioration in the funded status of the plan could increase pension expenses and reduce our profitability. See   Note 12. Pension Liability   in Part I, Item 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein. 
  We must continually design and introduce new products into the markets we serve to respond to competition and rapid technological changes. 
  We operate in a highly competitive environment where innovation is critical, our future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of our products and services. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products is critical to our continued success. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop new products, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and differentiate our products from those of competitors resulting in their adoption by customers. 
  We are subject to risks inherent in international operations. 
  Sales to our customers outside the United States were approximately   32.9%   and   34.8%   of our total sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The recent acquisitions of the power controls modules, and high voltage product lines have increased our presence in international locations. India is becoming a focus of possible expansion for sales, research and development, and manufacturing. Our success producing goods internationally and competing in international markets is subject to our ability to manage various risks and difficulties, including, but not limited to: 
             
    our ability to effectively manage our employees at remote locations who are operating in different business environments from the United States; 
                
    our ability to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers and other local businesses; 
                
    compliance with product safety requirements and standards that are different from those of the United States; 
                
    variations and changes in laws applicable to our operations in different jurisdictions, including enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; 
                
    trade restrictions, political instability, disruptions in financial markets, and deterioration of economic conditions; 
                
    customs regulations and the import and export of goods (including customs audits in various countries that occur from time to time); 
                
    the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations; 
                
    our ability to obtain business licenses that may be needed in international locations to support expanded operations;

     Table Of Contents  

timely collecting accounts receivable from foreign customers including $  14.5 million   in accounts receivable from foreign customers as of   September 30, 2016  ; and 
                
    changes in tariffs, taxes, and foreign currency exchange rates. 
     Our profitability and ability to implement our business strategies, maintain market share and compete successfully in international markets will be compromised if we are unable to manage these and other international risks successfully.  
  Globalization of sales increases risk of compliance with policy. 
  We operate in an increasingly complex sales environment around the world which places greater importance on our global control environment and imposes additional oversight risk. Such increased complexity  could adversely affect our operating results by increasing compliance costs in the near-term and by increasing the risk of control failures in the event of non-compliance. 
  Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales. 
  Currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency in which they receive payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Given recent acquisitions in Europe, our exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Euro is becoming more significant. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options to reduce currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as  Brexit . As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U.  Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our sales, operations and financial results. In particular, our operations in the U.K. may be adversely affected by extreme fluctuations in the UK exchange rates. Moreover, the imposition of any import restrictions and duties levied on our UK products as imported for E.U. customers may make our products more expensive for such customers and less competitive from a pricing perspective.  
  Changes in the value of the Chinese yuan could impact the cost of our operation in Shenzhen, PRC and our sales growth in our PRC markets. 
  The PRC government is continually pressured by its trading partners to allow its currency to float in a manner similar to other major currencies. In August 2015, China s currency devalued by a cumulative 4.4% against the U.S. dollar, making Chinese exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive by that amount. However, the devaluation negatively impacts U.S. businesses that trade with China because it puts them at a cost disadvantage. Any change in the value of the Chinese yuan may impact our ability to control the cost of our products in the world market. Specifically, the decision by the PRC government to allow the yuan to begin to float against the United States dollar could significantly increase the labor and other costs incurred in the operation of our Shenzhen facility and the cost of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies that we source in the PRC, thereby having a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  We have been, and in the future may again be, involved in litigation. Litigation is costly and could result in further restrictions on our ability to conduct business or make use of market relationships we have developed, or an inability to prevent others from using technology. 
  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our commercial or property rights, to defend ourselves against claimed violations of such rights, or to protect our interests in regulatory, tax, customs, commercial, and other disputes or similar matters. Litigation often requires a substantial amount of our management's time and attention, as well as financial and other resources, including: 
             
    substantial costs in the form of legal fees, fines, and royalty payments; 
                
    restrictions on our ability to sell certain products or in certain markets; 
                
    an inability to prevent others from using technology we have developed; and 
     
    35 

     Table Of Contents  

a need to redesign products or seek alternative marketing strategies. 
     Any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Funds associated with our marketable securities that we have traditionally held as short-term investments may not be liquid or readily available. 
  In the past, certain of our investments have been affected by external market conditions that impacted the liquidity of the investment. We do not currently have investments with reduced liquidity, but external market conditions that we cannot anticipate or mitigate may impact the liquidity of our marketable securities. Any changes in the liquidity associated with these investments may require us to borrow funds at terms that are not favorable or repatriate cash from international locations at a significant cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to borrow funds or continue to repatriate cash on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, our available cash may be reduced until those investments can be liquidated. The lack of available cash may prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise and may prevent us from executing some of our business plans, either of which could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to be materially and adversely affected. 
  Our intangible assets may become impaired. 
  We currently have   $43.6 million   of goodwill and   $30.2 million   in intangible assets at   September 30, 2016  . We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. The events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, and could harm the trading price of our common stock.  
  We are subject to numerous governmental regulations. 
  We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems and regulations governing the import, export and customs duties related to our products. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. Also, we may incur significant costs in complying with the myriad of different import, export and customs regulations as we seek to sell our products internationally. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards: 
             
    we could be subject to fines and penalties; 
                
    our production or shipments could be suspended; and 
                
    we could be prohibited from offering particular products in specified markets. 
     If we were unable to comply with current or future regulations, directives and standards, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
  Increased governmental action on income tax regulations could negatively impact our business. 
  International governments have heightened their review and scrutiny of multinational businesses like ours  which could increase our compliance costs and future tax liability to those governments.  As governments continue to look for ways to increase their revenue streams they could increase audits of companies to accelerate the recovery of monies perceived as owed to them under current or past regulations.  Such an increase in audit activity could have a negative impact on companies which operate internationally, as we do.  
  Recently enacted financial reform legislation will result in new laws and regulations that may increase our costs of operations. 
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We have to perform sufficient due diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. However, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products. In  
  
    36 

     Table Of Contents  

addition, we incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.  
  Changes in the US Political environment could negatively impact our business. 
  The upcoming Presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes, or uncertainty, in governmental policies, regulatory environments and many other factors and conditions, some of which could adversely impact our global operations in the near and long term, including but not limited to changes to existing trade agreements, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, income tax regulations and other broader market impacts that would create volatility in the markets we operate in and exchange rates. To the extent that the results of the upcoming election cycle have a negative impact on our markets, it may materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the periods to come. 
  The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which we have no control. 
  The stock market has from time to time experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to their operating performance. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources. 
  Our operating results are subject to fluctuations, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our share price may decrease significantly  . 
  Our annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, our sales cycle for development work is relatively long, and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period. If our earnings do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our stock could decline. 
  The loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. 
  Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management, technical, marketing, and sales employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract or retain additional skilled personnel as required. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. We must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of personnel retention. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees, if our succession plans do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected. 
  Deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.  
  Our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products both in domestic and export markets, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.  
  A disruption in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:  
             
     negatively impact global demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows; 
                
    make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future; 
                
    cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any technical or other waivers under our debt agreements to the extend we may seek them in the future;
