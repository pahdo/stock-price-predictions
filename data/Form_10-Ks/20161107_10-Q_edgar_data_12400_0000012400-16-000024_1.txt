  Notes to Condensed Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 
  (Reference is made to Notes to Financial Statements 
  included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K) 

(  1  )    MANAGEMENT S STATEMENT 
    
  The unaudited condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by Black Hills Power, Inc. (the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations; however, we believe that the footnotes adequately disclose the information presented.  These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto, included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
    
  Accounting methods historically employed require certain estimates as of interim dates.  The information furnished in the accompanying condensed financial statements reflects all adjustments, including accruals, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   financial information and are of a normal recurring nature.  The results of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , and our financial condition as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and financial condition to be expected as of or for any other period. 
    
  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, ASU 2016-15 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).    This ASU requires changes in the presentation of certain items including but not limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees.  The ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15  , 2017.      We are currently assessing the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Leases, ASU 2016-02 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840,   Leases  .  This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less.  The ASU does not significantly change the lessees  recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Lessors  accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The guidance is effective for us beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent), ASU 2015-07 
    
  On May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)  .    This   ASU removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and also removes certain disclosure requirements.  The new requirements were effective for us beginning January 1, 2016 and will be applied     retrospectively to all periods presented, in our 2016 Form 10-K.  This ASU will not materially affect our financial statements and disclosures, but will change certain presentation and disclosure of the fair value of certain plan assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plan disclosures in our 2016 Form 10-K, for all periods presented.

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, ASU 2015-03 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  .  Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts, rather than as an asset.  Amortization of these costs will continue to be reported as interest expense.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis.  As of September 30, 2016, we have presented the debt issuance costs, previously reported in other assets, as direct deductions from the carrying amount of long-term debt.  The implementation of this standard resulted in reductions of other non-current assets and long-term debt of   $3.1 million   in the Condensed Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015.  Adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our financial position. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2014-09 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance.  The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance.  On July 9, 2015, FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopting this guidance.  Under the modified approach, an entity would recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance with an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  As of September 30, 2016, we were actively evaluating all of our sources of revenue to determine the impact that adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Money Pool Notes Receivable and Notes Payable 
    
  We have entered into a Utility Money Pool Agreement (the  Agreement ) with BHC, Black Hills Service Company and the utility companies conducting business as Black Hills Energy.  We are the administrator of the Money Pool.  Under the Agreement, we may borrow from BHC; however the Agreement restricts us from loaning funds to BHC or to any of BHC s non-utility subsidiaries.  The Agreement does not restrict us from paying dividends to BHC.  Borrowings and advances under the Agreement bear interest at the weighted average daily cost of our parent company s credit facility borrowings as defined under the Agreement, or if there are no external funds outstanding on that date, then the rate will be the daily one-month LIBOR plus   1.0%  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the average cost of borrowing under the Utility Money Pool was   1.81%  .

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
       
  Beginning in 2016, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension, supplemental non-qualified defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs.  The new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant projected cash outflows.  Previously, those costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate.  The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offsets the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.  The new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates.  We accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.  The discount rates used to measure the 2016 service costs are   4.81%  ,   4.88%   and   4.18%   for pension, supplemental non-qualified defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.  The discount rates used to measure the 2016 interest costs are   3.90%  ,   3.82%   and   3.17%   for pension, supplemental non-qualified defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively. The previous method would have used a discount rate for both service and interest costs of   4.63%   for pension,   4.50%   for supplemental non-qualified defined benefit and   4.03%   for other postretirement benefit costs.  The decrease in the total 2016 service and interest costs is approximately   $0.5 million  ,   $0.3 million   and   $0.1 million   for the pension, supplemental non-qualified defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively, as compared to the previous method.

    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
       
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy for grouping assets and liabilities, based on significance of inputs.  For additional information see Note 1 included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
    
  The estimated fair values of our financial instruments were as follows (in thousands) as of: 

_________________ 
           (a) 
    Carrying value approximates fair value due to either short-term length of maturity or variable interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates and therefore is classified in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
              (b) 
    Long-term debt is valued using the market approach based on observable inputs of quoted market prices and yields available for debt instruments either directly or indirectly for similar maturities and debt ratings in active markets and therefore is classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The carrying amount of our variable rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates with short reset periods.

  Regulatory Matters 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we commenced construction of the $54 million, 230-kV, 144 mile-long transmission line that will connect the Teckla Substation in northeast Wyoming, to the Lange Substation near Rapid City, South Dakota.  The first segment of this project connecting Teckla to Osage, WY was energized on August 31, 2016.  The second segment of the project is expected to be placed in service in the first half of 2017. 

Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, gross margin, that is considered a  non-GAAP financial measure.   Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Gross margin (revenue less cost of sales) is a non-GAAP financial measure due to the exclusion of depreciation from the measure.  The presentation of gross margin is intended to supplement investors  understanding of our operating performance. 
    
  Gross margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel and purchased power.  Our gross margin is impacted by the fluctuations in power purchases, natural gas and other fuel supply costs.  However, while these fluctuating costs impact gross margin as a percentage of revenue, they only impact total gross margin if the costs cannot be passed through to our customers. 
    
  Our gross margin measure may not be comparable to other companies  gross margin measure.  Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. 
    
  The following tables provide certain financial information and operating statistics:

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  .    Net income was   $12 million   compared to   $12 million   for the same period in the prior year primarily due to the following: 
    
  Gross margin     decreased   primarily due to lower retail volumes and the impact of a decrease in cooling degree days compared to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Operations and maintenance     decreased   primarily due to lower employee costs driven by a change in operating expense allocations impacting us as a result of our Parent Company integrating the acquired SourceGas utilities and lower generation and outside services, partially offset by higher depreciation expense driven by additional plant in service compared to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Interest expense, net   decreased primarily due to higher AFUDC income in the current year driven by higher construction work-in-process balances compared to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Other income, net   was comparable to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Income tax expense  :  The effective tax rate was comparable to the same period in the prior year.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  .    Net income was   $33 million   compared to   $33 million   for the same period in the prior year primarily due to the following: 
    
  Gross margin     decreased   primarily due to a prior year increase in return on invested capital of $1.2 million from a rate case, a $1.8 million decrease due to third party billing true-ups related to the current and prior years and a decrease in commercial MW sold driven by lower demand, partially offset by the weather impact from the increase in cooling degree days compared to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Operations and maintenance     decreased   primarily due to lower employee costs driven by a change in operating expense allocations impacting us as a result of our Parent Company integrating the acquired SourceGas utilities, partially offset by higher depreciation expense driven by additional plant in service compared to the same period in the prior year.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC.  Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation those statements that are identified by the words  anticipates ,  estimates ,  expects ,  intends ,  plans ,  predicts  and similar expressions, and include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical facts.  From time to time, the Company may publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature, including statements contained within Item 2 - Management s Discussion   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed.  The Company s expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have a reasonable basis, including without limitation, management s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company s records and other data available from third parties.  Nonetheless, the Company s expectations, beliefs or projections may not be achieved or accomplished. 
    
  Any forward-looking statement contained in this document speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all of the factors, nor can it assess the effect of each factor on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.  All forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are expressly qualified by the risk factors and cautionary statements described in Item 1A of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements contained within Item 1A - Risk Factors and Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Based on their evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .
