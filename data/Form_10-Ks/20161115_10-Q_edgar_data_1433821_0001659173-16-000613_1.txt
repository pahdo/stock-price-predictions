  1.       
  Nature of Operations   

 American Housing Income Trust,
Inc. ( we ,  our , the  Company ) was incorporated on December 17, 2007 under the laws of the
State of Nevada. On February 13, 2015, following the acquisition of the majority and controlling shares of the Company by American
Realty Partners, LLC ( ARP ), a change of control of the Company took place. On May 11, 2015, the Company converted
into a Maryland corporation and changed its name to American Housing Income Trust, Inc. 

 On August 3, 2015, the Company,
and Valfre Holdings, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, and James A. Valfre and Pamela J. Valfre, f/k/a Pruitt (collectively,
 Valfre ) closed on the Company's acquisition of nine single family residences in Arizona through an umbrella limited
liability partnership organized in Maryland called  AHIT Valfre, LLP  ( AHIT Valfre ). Pursuant to the AHIT
Valfre Agreements, in consideration for the conveyance of the nine single family residences, which were acquired by AHIT Valfre
 subject to  existing mortgages, AHIT Valfre issued limited partnership interests to Valfre. On April 8, 2016, AHIT
Valfre completed its internal restructuring and the partners in AHIT Valfre restructured their respective interests in the partnership
resulting in AHIT Valfre GP, LLC ( AHIT Valfre GP ) and AHIT Valfre Limiteds, LLC ( AHIT Valfre Limiteds )
serving as General Partner and Limited Partner respectively, of AHIT Valfre. 

 On August 2, 2016, the Company,
and Northern New Mexico Properties, LLC, a New Mexico limited liability company closed on the Company s acquisition
of six single family residences, four apartments and sixteen mobile homes spaces located in New Mexico through an umbrella limited
liability partnership organized in Maryland called  AHIT Northern NM Properties, LLP  ( AHIT NNMP). Pursuant
to the AHIT NNMP Agreements, in consideration for the conveyance of the six single family residences, four apartments and sixteen
mobile homes spaces, which were acquired by AHIT NNMP  subject to  existing mortgages, AHIT NNMP issued limited partnership
interests to Northern New Mexico Properties, LLC. 

 The Company is in the business
of acquiring and operating residential properties. As of the date of this filing, the Company holds title to 54 residential properties
and 1 commercial property. 

 2.       Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

 a)   Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

 These unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( US ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in the Company s
Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2016.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown have been
reflected herein.  The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a
full year or for any future period. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained
in the audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as reported in the Company's Form 10-K have
been omitted. 

[Financial Index]    

These consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries ARP, and its subsidiary special purpose entities,
ARP Pledgor, LLC, ARP Borrower, LLC, ARP Pledgor II, LLC, APR Borrower II, LLC, AHIT Valfre, LLP, AHIT Valfre GP, LLC and AHIT
NNMP, LLP. All significant intercompany transaction and balances have been eliminated. 

 b)    Use
of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, and income taxes.
The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results
experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material
differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 

 c)    Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts
reported in the consolidated balance sheets for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, amounts due to/from related parties
and notes payable are reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
and their expected realization and if, applicable, the stated rate of interest is equivalent to rates currently available. 

Fair
value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements, defined
as follows: 

L   evel
1    Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities in an active market that management has the ability to access. 

  Level
2    Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active
or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (commodity
derivatives and interest rate swaps). 

  Level
3    Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require
inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  These inputs reflect management s
own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

 The Company does not have any financial
instruments that are required to be measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 

[Financial Index]    

d)   Non-controlling
Interest 

 Limited partnership units in
AHIT Valfre and AHIT NNMP that are not owned by the Company are presented as non-controlling interest in the equity section of
our consolidated balance sheets. 

 Our limited partners do not have
the right to share in the net income or losses of AHIT Valfre and AHIT NNMP but have the right to convert all or part of their
partnership units to common shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis following the one-year anniversary of issuance. At the
time of redemption, we have the right to determine whether to redeem the non-controlling limited partnership units of AHIT Valfre
and AHIT NNMP for cash, based upon the fair value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at the time of redemption.
As of September 30, 2016, there were 300,026 limited partnership units outstanding in AHIT Valfre and 500,614 limited partnership
units outstanding in AHIT NNMP. 

  e)       
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases. This ASU is based on the principle that entities
should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases. The ASU does not significantly change the lessees 
recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard. Leases are
classified as finance or operating. The ASU s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease
liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
lease arrangements. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for
leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessors  accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from the previous
accounting standard. In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. Lessees and lessors will
use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients. The effective date will be
the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted. Management continues to assess the overall impact the
adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s financial statements 

 In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). This update
is intended to provide simplification of the accounting for share based payment transactions, including the accounting for income
taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The effective
date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 with early adoption permitted. Management continues to assess the overall impact
the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company s financial statements. 

 In August 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the
Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement
of cash flows. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. Management continues
to assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company s financial statements. 

 The Company has implemented all
new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations. 

[Financial Index]    

3.    Going
Concern  

  These
interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has never paid any dividends
and is unlikely to pay dividends in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is
dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing
to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
incurred a net loss of $ 4,290,611, and a s at September 30, 2016, the Company has accumulated
losses of $12,285,258 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.  

Management
has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes obtaining equity financing and reducing expenses. Although the
Company has successfully completed financings in the past fiscal years, the Company cannot assure that the plans to address these
matters in the future will be successful.  

  4.       
  Formation of AHIT-NNMP  

On
July 13, 2016, the Company entered into the Master UPREIT Formation Agreement set forth in Section 1, above, resulting in the

partnership. AHIT NNMP is intended to serve as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as an
 UPREIT . On August 2, 2016, AHIT NNMP acquired from the Northern New Mexico Properties, LLC,   six
single family residences, four apartments and sixteen mobile homes spaces located in New Mexico  in
exchange for a total consideration of approximately $1,334,000 consisting of 500,614 common units in the UPREIT valued at approximately

  General Description of Business  

 The Company was incorporated
on December 17, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 13, 2015, following the acquisition of the majority and
controlling shares of the Company by American Realty Partners, LLC ( ARP ), a change of control of the Company took place.
On May 11, 2015, the Company converted into a Maryland corporation and changed its name to American Housing Income Trust, Inc. 

 The Company is currently in
the business of acquiring, renovating, rehabilitating and, in turn, renting single family residence. The Company intends on continuing
with this business plan, but with the proceeds from the offering set forth in its pending registration statement on Form S-11/A,
it intends on growing its portfolio, adding more diversity and independence to its Board of Directors, and securing more favorable
terms on its debt service. The Company intends on operating as a REIT in 2016, and if it meets the qualifications of a REIT, the
Company intends on complying with the dividend policy announced in its registration statement on Form S-11/A. 

 The Company currently operates
through related-party/affiliate entities in holding title to those single family residences in its portfolio   American Realty,
ARP Borrower, ARP Borrower II and AHIT Valfre, LLP, a limited liability partnership commonly referred to as an UPREIT, or operating
umbrella partnership. The Company's commitment to raise additional capital, as set forth in the prospectus under its registration
statement on Form S-11/A, underscores its intention of aggressively pursuing its short-term and long-term business plan. The Company
believes it is still positioned to declare status as a real estate investment trust for tax year 2016. We cannot guarantee we will
be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise,
including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns.

the summary income statement for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of $1,548,126 and $1,124,089, respectively. The
change in net loss between the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to the increase of
$466,288 in operating expense offset by the increase of $42,251 in revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2016,
depreciation increased by $16,058, general and administrative expense increased by $444,858, interest expense increased by
$5,372. The increase in operating expense is a result of increased professional and consulting fees incurred in relation to
our reporting requirements as a public company and preparing the registration statement, stock-based compensation of $960,000
recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in relation to shares issuable to the Company s management,
directors and employees pursuant to two employment agreement and two director agreements. The net increase of $444,858 in
general and administrative expense is mainly related to the increase of $416,043 in management and consulting fees, $99,233
in advertising and marketing costs, $8,720 in overhead costs, and offset by a decrease of $9,544 in professional fees,
$41,354 in rental property expenses, $7,400 in refinancing costs, a decrease of $12,752 in sales expense and the gain on
forgiveness of accounts payable of $8,088. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized
stock-based compensation of $960,000 pursuant to two employment agreements and two director agreements. The fair value of
$960,000 is included in general and administrative expense.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of $4,290,611 and $2,291,653, respectively. The change
in net loss between the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to the increase of $2,108,666

increased by $41,173, general and administrative expense increased by $2,313,685, interest expense increased by $86,896. The increase
in operating expense is a result of increased professional and consulting fees incurred in relation to our reporting requirements

nine months ended September 30, 2016 in relation to shares issuable to the Company s management and directors pursuant to
four employment agreements and two director agreements. The net increase of $2,305,597 in general and administrative expense is
mainly related to the increase of $1,437,351 in management and consulting fees, $238,277 in professional fees, $19,188 in overhead
costs and $701,155 in advertising and marketing costs and offset by a decrease of $17,403 in refinancing costs, $2,368 in rental
property costs, $62,515 in sales expenses and the gain on forgiveness of accounts payable of $8,088. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recognized stock-based compensation of $2,601,058 pursuant to four employment agreements and two

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Liquidity is a measure of our
ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations and other general business needs. Our liquidity,
to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our
near-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of purchasing our target assets, restoring and leasing properties and funding
our operations. 

[Table of Contents]    

Our long-term liquidity needs
primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition and maintenance of properties; non-recurring capital expenditures; interest
and principal payments on our indebtedness; and general and administrative expenses. We seek to satisfy our long-term liquidity
needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, the issuance of debt and equity securities,
and property dispositions. We have financed our operations and acquisitions to date through the funding by members of our
subsidiaries and third party loans, including the debt service identified above in the section titled  Description
of Business.  

 We believe our current available
cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient to meet our cash needs for the near future if we do not receive additional
funding. Our assets are illiquid by their nature. Thus, a timely liquidation of assets might not be a viable source of short-terms
liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise that cause a need for additional liquidity. It could be necessary to source liquidity
from other financing alternatives should any such scenario arise. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in
amounts or terms acceptable to us, if at all. In that event, we would be required to change our growth strategy and seek funding
on that basis, if at all. 

   Cash Flow Information   

Net cash used for operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,500,379 and $1,969,511, respectively.
The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the increase in revenue and from the timing of payments
of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties. 

 Net cash provided by investing
activities for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 was $183,176 as compared to $922,106 of net cash
used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was due to the proceeds from sale of
real estate properties of $211,200 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $111,000 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company spent $22,908 in improving existing
rental properties as compared to $1,033,106 spent during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 on purchase of real estate properties
and improvements. The Company also purchased $5,116 of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to $0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

 Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,208,279 as compared to $3,011,930 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The change was due to proceeds from sale of common stock of $509,600 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,926,505 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, proceeds
from issuance of notes payable of $325,232 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $120,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and net advances from related parties of $425,774 in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $nil in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, offset by the repayment of notes payable of $52,327 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $34,575 in the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

Our estimated working capital
requirement for the next 12 months is $1,665,000 with an estimated burn rate of $139,000 per month. As reflected in the accompanying
financial statements, we had cash of $90,646 at September 30, 2016.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk   

 We have not utilized any derivative
financial instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and
futures. We believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities. We do not have any borrowings (however,
our wholly-owned subsidiary does service debt related to the properties owned by the subsidiary), and, consequently, we are not
affected by changes in market interest rates. We do not currently have any sales or own assets and operate facilities in countries
outside the United States and, consequently, we are not affected by foreign currency fluctuations or exchange rate changes. Overall,
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial
condition or results of operations. 

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We have not entered into any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

   Critical Accounting Policies   

 Our financial statements and
related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an
impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information
contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our
use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant
estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2
of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations,
we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant
impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may
differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any
other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position
or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies and procedures, among
others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: 

  Investment in Real Estate  -
We allocate the purchase price to tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and building) based on the estimated
fair values of those tangible assets. Fair value for land and building is based on the purchase price for these properties.

Property/SFRs acquired not
subject to an existing lease are accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the property recorded at the purchase price, including
acquisition costs. We incur costs to prepare our acquired properties to be rented. These costs are capitalized and allocated to
building costs. Costs related to the restoration or improvement of our properties that improve and extend their useful lives are
capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. 

 Depreciation is computed on
a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the properties (building and improvements - 27 years). 

  Revenue Recognition  -
Rental income for property leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. We lease single-family
residences that we own and manage directly to tenants who occupy the properties under operating leases, generally, with terms of
one year. We perform credit investigations on prospective tenants and obtains security deposits. Sales and the associated gains
or losses of real estate assets are recognized in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment
- Real Estate Sale. The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the
transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If
the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and accounts for continued
operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until
the sales criteria are met. 

  Related Party  -
A party is considered to be related to us if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls,
is controlled by, or is under common control with ourselves. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its
management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to
an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest
in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party. 

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 The Company does not expect
the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations,
financial position, or cash flow. 

   Properties   

 We currently lease an office
at the address set forth above. We believe that this space will be sufficient for our initial needs, although as funding and revenues
become available, and the Company's operations grow, we anticipate finding other office space as needed. 

    Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

 None.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

   Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

 As required by Rule 13a-15
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company's
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
Exchange Commission and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our company's management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities
and Exchange Commission guidelines. Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until
the material weaknesses are remediated. 

 As described in Basis of Presentation
in the Annual Report for fiscal year 2015, the Company recently determined that a material weakness existed in the Firm's internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2015.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. 

 As a result of that determination,
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have since concluded that the Firm's disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

 We plan to take steps to enhance
and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to
implement the following changes subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address
inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for
accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing
to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may
be adversely affected in a material manner. 

 Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake.
