  1. ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND BASIS FOR PRESENTATION  
     
  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:  
     
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) have been made to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the December 31, 2015 annual report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and nine months period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year ended December 31, 2016. The Company operates in a single segment of activity, namely the acquisition of certain mineral property, mining rights, and their subsequent development.  
     
  GOING CONCERN MATTERS:  
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplated the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has incurred net losses of $1,518,813 and $2,073,005, respectively. The Company has working capital deficit (current liabilities exceed current assets) of approximately $18,140,000 and stock holders  deficit of approximately $12,013,500 as of September 30, 2016.  Management pursued additional investors and lending institutions interested in financing the Company's projects. However, there is no assurance that the Company will obtain the financing that it requires or will achieve profitable operations. The Company expected to incur additional losses for the near term until such time as it would derive substantial revenues from the Armenian mining interests acquired by it or other future projects. These matters raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplated the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the periods then ended did not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
     
  ORGANIZATION:  
     
  The Company is engaged in exploration for, as well as development and mining of, gold, silver, and other minerals in Armenia, Canada and Chile. Until March 31, 2011, the Company's headquarters were located in Greenwich, Connecticut and as of April 1, 2011 the Company s headquarters are in Rye, NY.  Its subsidiaries and staff maintain offices in Yerevan, Armenia, and Santiago, Chile. The Company was incorporated as Triad Energy Corporation in the State of Delaware on February 21, 1980 and conducted other business prior to January 1, 1995. During 1995, the Company changed its name from Triad Energy Corporation to Global Gold Corporation to pursue certain gold and copper mining rights in the former Soviet Republics of Armenia and Georgia. The Company has not established proven and probable reserves in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7 at any of its properties.  The Company's stock is publicly traded. The Company employs approximately 20 people globally on a year round basis. In the past, the Company has employed up to an additional 200 people on a seasonal basis, but the Company s engagement of a mine contractor to run mining operations has reduced the number of employees directly employed by the Company on a seasonal basis.  
     
  In Armenia, the Company s focus is on the exploration, development and production of gold at the Toukhmanuk property in the North Central Armenian Belt and the Marjan and an expanded Marjan North property.  In addition, the Company is exploring and developing other sites in Armenia. The Company has stopped work at the Getik property in Armenia.    

6

In Chile, the Company is engaged in identifying gold exploration and production opportunities and the Company s Vice President maintains an office in Santiago.  
     
  In Canada, the Company had engaged in uranium exploration activities in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, but has phased out this activity, retaining a royalty interest in the Cochrane Pond property in Newfoundland.  
     
  The Company also assesses exploration and production opportunities in other countries.  
     
  The subsidiaries of the Company are as follows:  
     
  On August 18, 2003, the Company formed Global Gold Armenia LLC ("GGA"), as a wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn formed Global Gold Mining, LLC ("GGM"), as a wholly owned subsidiary, both in the State of Delaware. GGM was qualified to do business as a branch operation in Armenia and owns assets, royalty and participation interests, as well as shares of operating companies in Armenia.  
     
  On December 21, 2003, GGM acquired 100% of the Armenian limited liability company SHA, LLC (renamed Global Gold Hankavan, LLC ("GGH") as of July 21, 2006), which held the license to the Hankavan and Marjan properties in Armenia.  On December 18, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Caldera Resources Inc. ( Caldera ) outlining the terms of a joint venture on the Company s Marjan property in Armenia ( Marjan JV ).  On March 12, 2010, GGH transferred the rights, title and interest for the Marjan property to Marjan Mining Company LLC, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Armenia ( Marjan RA ) which is a wholly owned subsidiary of GGM.   On October 7, 2010, the Company terminated the Marjan JV.  The Armenian Court of Cassation in a final, non-appealable decision, issued and effective February 8, 2012, ruled that the registration and assumption of control by Caldera through unilateral charter changes of the Marjan Mine and Marjan RA were illegal and that 100% ownership rests fully with GGM.  On March 29, 2012, Justice Herman Cahn, who was appointed by United States District Court Judge Hellerstein as the sole arbitrator in an American Arbitration Association arbitration between the Company and Caldera, ruled in the Company s favor on the issue of the JV s termination ordering that the Marjan property be 100% owned by the Company effective April 29, 2012.  Judge Karas of the United States Federal District Court confirmed Judge Cahn s decision.  On November 10, 2014, a Final Award in the Company s favor ruled that Caldera had no interest whatsoever in Marjan RA or the Marjan Property. See Legal Proceedings for more information on the Marjan JV.     
     
  On August 1, 2005, GGM acquired 51% of the Armenian limited liability company Mego-Gold, LLC ("Mego"), which is the licensee for the Toukhmanuk mining property and seven surrounding exploration sites.  On August 2, 2006, GGM acquired the remaining 49% interest of Mego-Gold, LLC, leaving GGM as the owner of 100% of Mego-Gold, LLC.  See Agreements for more information on Mego-Gold, LLC.  
     
  On January 31, 2006, GGM closed a transaction to acquire 80% of the Armenian company, Athelea Investments, CJSC (renamed "Getik Mining Company, LLC") and its approximately 27 square kilometer Getik gold/uranium exploration license area in the northeast Geghargunik province of Armenia.  As of May 30, 2007, GGM acquired the remaining 20% interest in Getik Mining Company, LLC, leaving GGM as the owner of 100% of Getik Mining Company, LLC.  See Agreements for more information on Getik Mining Company, LLC.  
     
  On January 5, 2007, the Company formed Global Gold Uranium, LLC ("Global Gold Uranium"), as a wholly owned subsidiary, in the State of Delaware, to operate the Company's uranium exploration activities in Canada.  
     
  On September 23, 2011, Global Gold Consolidated Resources Limited ( GGCRL ) was incorporated in Jersey as a 51% subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the April 27, 2011 Joint Venture Agreement with Consolidated Resources.  See Agreements Section for more information on Consolidated Resources agreements.  
     
  On November 8, 2011, GGCR Mining, LLC ( GGCR Mining ) was formed in Delaware as a 100%, wholly owned, subsidiary of GGCRL. On September 26, 2012, the Company conditionally transferred 100% of the shares of Mego and Getik Mining Company, LLC to GGCR Mining. See Agreements section.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
     
  Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less when purchased and are carried at fair value.  
     
  Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are assumptions about useful life of property and equipment, inventory valuation, stock based compensation and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances.    
     
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company s financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.  
     
  ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:  

Level 1:   
 
  Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities    

Level 2:       
 
  Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data    

Level 3:       
 
  Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions.     
     
  The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  The Company discloses the estimated fair values for all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value short-term financial instruments including cash, receivables, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximates book value due to their short-term duration.  
      
  Cash and cash equivalents include money market securities and commercial paper that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  
     
  In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued,  The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  effective for January 1, 2008. This guidance expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value option for any of its qualifying financial instruments.

Inventories - Inventories consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Ore inventory consists of unprocessed ore at the Toukhmanuk mining site in Armenia. The concentrate and unprocessed ore are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company is currently reporting its inventory at cost which is still less than the current market value so recent fluctuations in gold prices have no effect on our carrying value of inventory. The Ore inventory is pledged as collateral for the mine owner s debt facility and secured line of credit.  
     
  Deposits on Contracts and Equipment - The Company made several deposits for purchases, the majority of which is for the potential acquisition of new properties, and the remainder for the purchase of mining equipment. The Company carried Deposits on contracts and equipment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $413,509, and $452,827, respectively.  
     
  Tax Refunds Receivable - The Company is subject to Value Added Tax ("VAT tax") on all expenditures in Armenia at the rate of 20%. The Company is entitled to a credit against this tax towards any sales on which it collects VAT tax. The Company is carrying a tax refund receivable based on the value of its in-process inventory which it intends on selling in the next twelve months, at which time they will collect 20% VAT tax from the purchaser which the Company will be entitled to keep and apply against its credit.  
       
  Net Loss Per Share - Basic net loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Potential common shares includable in the computation of fully diluted per share results are not presented in the consolidated financial statements as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  There were no options that were exercisable at September 30, 2016 and as of September 30, 2015 the total number of options that were exercisable was 2,954,167. There were no warrants outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Stock Based Compensation - The Company periodically issues shares of common stock for services rendered or for financing costs. Such shares are valued based on the market price on the transaction date.  The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs.  
     
  The Company accounts for the grant of stock and warrants awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation (ASC 718).  ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of warrants and stock options and other equity based compensation.  
     
  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net loss and loss per share include the actual deduction for stock-based compensation expense. The total stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $32,193 and $61,485, respectively and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,406 and $3,197, respectively. The expense for stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense item.

Comprehensive Income - The Company has adopted ASC Topic 220,  Comprehensive Income.   Comprehensive income is comprised of net income (loss) and all changes to stockholders' equity (deficit), except those related to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distribution to owners.  
     
  The following table summarizes the computations reconciling net loss applicable to Global Gold Corporation Common Shareholders to comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  
     
  Acquisition, Exploration and Development Costs - Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized. Additionally, mine development costs incurred either to develop new ore deposits and constructing new facilities are capitalized until operations commence.  All such capitalized costs are amortized using a straight-line basis on a range from 1-10 years, based on the minimum original license term at acquisition, but do not exceed the useful life of the capitalized costs.  Upon commercial development of an ore body, the applicable capitalized costs would then be amortized using the units-of-production method.  Exploration costs, costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations.  Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment.  The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property, plant and equipment costs, if any, to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable value and if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded.  The periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected cash flows and/or estimated salvage value in accordance with ASC Topic 360, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  
     
  Foreign Currency Translation - The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. All transactions initiated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC Topic 830  Foreign Currency Matters  and the related rate fluctuation on transactions is included the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
     
  The functional currency of the Company's Armenian subsidiaries is the local currency. For foreign operations with the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated from the local currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date and equity is translated at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period to approximate translation at the exchange rate prevailing at the dates those elements are recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining comprehensive loss. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the exchange rate for the Armenian Dram (AMD) was 475 AMD for $1.00 U.S.  
     
  Principles of Consolidation - Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and include the accounts of the Company and more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries that it controls.   Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization - Capitalized costs are depreciated or depleted using the straight-line method over the shorter of estimated productive lives of such facilities or the useful life of the individual assets. Productive lives range from 1 to 20 years, but do not exceed the useful life of the individual asset. Determination of expected useful lives for amortization calculations are made on a property-by-property or asset-by-asset basis at least annually.  
     
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Management reviews and evaluates the net carrying value of all facilities, including idle facilities, for impairment at least annually, or upon the occurrence of other events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We estimate the net realizable value of each property based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that will be generated from operations at each property, the estimated salvage value of the surface plant and equipment and the value associated with property interests. All assets at an operating segment are evaluated together for purposes of estimating future cash flows.  
     
  Licenses - Licenses are capitalized at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis on a range from 1 to 10 years, but do not exceed the useful life of the individual license.  The Company did not have any amortization expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, amortization expense totaled $24,860 and $174,018, respectively.  
     
  Reclamation and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations) - Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value unless subject to a contractually obligated fixed payment schedule. Such costs are based on management's current estimate of amounts to be incurred when the remediation work is performed within current laws and regulations. The Company has paid towards it environmental costs and has no amounts owed as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  It is possible that, due to uncertainties associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental contamination and the application of laws and regulations by regulatory authorities and changes in reclamation or remediation technology, the ultimate cost of reclamation and remediation could change in the future.  
     
  Noncontrolling Interests - Noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries are recorded in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810,  Consolidation  and are reported as a component of equity, separate from the parent company s equity.  Purchase or sale of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions.  Results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interests are included in our consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control, the interest sold, as well as interest retained, if any, will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.  
     
  Revenue Recognition - Sales will be recognized and revenues will be recorded when title transfers and the rights and obligations of ownership pass to the customer. The majority of the company's metal concentrates will be sold under pricing arrangements where final prices will be determined by quoted market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. In these circumstances, revenues will be recorded at the times of sale based on forward prices for the expected date of the final settlement.    
     
  New Accounting Standards:  
     
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  

11

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   , which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. Adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.  
     
  A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  
     
  The following table illustrates the capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation arriving at the net carrying value on our books at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The Company had depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $80,659 and $98,211, respectively. The Company had depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $26,959 and $33,043, respectively.  
     
  The Company has requested but not received substantiation from Linne Mining for advances and amounts drawn down on the Mine Operator's Debt Facility. Equipment and assets for which title has transferred to the Company, and have been received by the Company are recorded as the Company's property, plant and equipment. Construction in process includes the Company's assets which are not yet completed and place in service, such as the new plant at the Toukhmanuk property in Armenia (Pictures of construction progress are available on the Company s website).

4. RECEIVABLE FROM SALE  
     
  On June 26, 2014, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution delivered a Final Award in the matter of Global Gold Corporation vs. Amarant Mining LTD and Alluvia Mining, Ltd. awarding Global Gold $16,800,000 USD plus $68,570USD in interest, costs, and fees, with post-award interest on unpaid amounts accruing at 9%. This award emanates from Global Gold s 2011 sale of Chilean gold mining assets and the buyers  repeated failures to pay and misrepresentations as described in prior filings and summarized below. In addition, the Tribunal s June 26, 2014 Award provided the following injunctive relief:   Per my previous orders in this matter, each of Amarant and Alluvia, including its officers and agents individually (including without limitation Johan Ulander), is continued to be enjoined, directly and indirectly, from alienating any assets, from transferring or consenting to the transfer of any shares, or performing or entering any transactions which would have the effect of alienating assets pending payment to Global Gold; Each of Amarant and Alluvia, including its officers and agents (including without limitation Johan Ulander) will provide within 5 business days all contracts, draft agreements, emails, records of financial transactions, financial statements, and all other documents in connection with their business affairs for purposes of determining whether Respondents have complied with the July 29, 2013 and subsequent orders, have diverted funds which could have been used to pay Global Gold, and to aid Global Gold in collection.  Respondents shall specifically provide all documents related to Gulf Resource Capital, Amarant Finance, the IGE Resources stock sale and related transactions as well as documents related to the institutions from which Respondents have represented payment would issue including but not limited to: Mangold, Swedebank, Jool Capital, Skandinavska Bank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Volksbank, Loyal Bank, Danskebank, NSBO, the  offtaker,  and Clifford Chance escrow account. Respondents shall execute any documents reasonably necessary or required by any institution to give Claimant access to this information and documents.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was owed principal amounts (excluding penalties, interest, and additional payments) of $16,868,570 from Amarant from the sale of 100% of the Company s interest in the Compania Minera Global Gold Valdivia S.C.M. company ( GGV ) (and the June 26, 2014 arbitral final award), which held the Pureo mining assets in Chile and 100% interest in its wholly owned subsidiaries Global Oro LLC and Global Plata LLC which are each 50% owners of Minera Global Chile Limitada, all as part of the amended agreement closed on December 2, 2011.  The Company wrote down principal amounts of $16,868,570 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as impairment as Amarant has made partial payments but has yet to pay the full principal amounts due in full.  Amarant has reportedly assigned its interest to Alluvia Mining Limited, a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey ( Alluvia ), an assignment which the Company conditionally consented as of June 15, 2012, but as of September 30, 2016 and December 13, 2016, the conditions were not been met by any of Conventus, Amarant or Mr. Ulander. Amarant and Alluvia further entered into agreements with Gulf Resources Capital and other parties which the Company is researching to determine any of their liabilities.   For details refer to Note 14   Legal Proceedings paragraph Amarant and Alluvia Related.

5. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following:  

6. MINE OWNERS DEBT FACILITIES  
     
  On July 5, 2013, GGCRL, GGCR Mining, and Mego concluded a fifteen year mine operating agreement with Linne as the operator along with an $8,800,000 debt facilities agreement to fund future production at the central section of the Toukhmanuk gold-silver open pit mine in Armenia. The debt facility includes interest at LIBOR plus 8%, and the operator, Linne, has an incentive based compensation model, to be paid approved costs plus 10% of the actual sales of gold, granting share options for up to 10% in GGCRL or the subsidiary project company in Armenia to Jacero Holdings Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus ( Jacero ), and extending the existing offtake agreement with IM until the end of 2027. The loan may be pre-paid. GGCRL and GGC have signed as Guarantors on the debt facility agreement. The debt was secured by the Getik license as well as a subordinated security interest to ABB in Mego shares, the Toukhmanuk mining and exploration licenses, ore stockpile included in the Company s Inventory and Mego property. The mine operator has procured a plant for expansion and reportedly began to restart production. Pictures of plant construction progress are on the Company s website. While Linne procured and began assembling a new processing plant at Toukhmanuk, completion has been delayed, mining in accordance with relevant agreements and approved plans has not occurred, and Linne has asked to be relieved of its responsibilities but terms for accommodating that request have not been agreed to and Linne continues to be responsible. The Company is carrying this as a liability, though the Company contests this liability based on substantiation concerns and offsetting amounts caused by damage and non performance by Linne, as well as other reasons.  The balance due on the debt facilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $4,104,577. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued interest of $1,092,675 and $814,096, respectively, on this debt facility based on calculations from Linne which the Company does not agree with or have support for.  
         
  7. CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE  
     
  On December 29, 2011, the Company and CRA signed a Binding Term sheet for a convertible note facility for not less than $2,000,000 with a cash coupon of 3% per annum and a guaranteed minimum IRR of 15% at a  Liquidity Event  (the  Convertible Notes ).  The Convertible Notes were guaranteed by GGC until the execution of the shares transfer agreements, which occurred on September 26, 2013.  On January 17, 2012, the Company signed an  Instrument  covering the Convertible Notes supplementing the December 29, 2011 Binding Term sheet.  The Instrument removed the 3% per annum cash coupon and provided that the Convertible Notes could be prepaid at any time prior to a liquidity event at par, defining a Liquidity Event as  an initial public offering of the Company s ordinary shares on a stock exchange or a Change of Control of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. A Change of Control was defined as  a change of 50.1% or more of a beneficial ownership of the legal and beneficial ownership of the Company or the relevant subsidiary except in the case of an initial public offering.  On February 19, 2012, the Company, GGC, CRA and their respective subsidiaries signed a series of additional agreements which appointed GGM as the interim manager of the business and required reimbursement of its budgeted and other cost.  In April and May 2012, notices of breach of those February 2012 agreements were issued and damages claims were asserted, then the outstanding issues were resolved in documents and resolutions executed on September 19, 2012.  On September 19, 2012, repayment of the Convertible Notes was extended to the sooner of September 19, 2013, a Public Listing, or a financing of the Company with interest payable at 4% per annum.  The joint venture was closed on October 26, 2012 with the registration of the Mego and Getik share transfer agreements.  On November 22, 2013, the Company, GGC, CRA, and other parties agreed that all outstanding GGCRL group debt including the Convertible Notes will be audited and agreed then assumed by Signature Gold as part of the merger transaction. The November 22, 2013 agreement also provided that a repayment schedule of all debt will be determined once the audit is complete.   The November 22, 2013 agreement did not trigger a 15% IRR provision because it does not constitute a Liquidity Event until the merged companies shares are publicly listed and is not a change of control since the beneficial ownership does not change by 50.1%.   

15

On January 20, 2012, March 8, 2012, and March 28, 2012, the Company signed and approved Convertible Notes certificates each in the amount of $500,000 and totaling $1,500,000 and is carrying this as a liability, though the Company does not accept this liability for fraud, contractual terms, and offsetting amounts caused by damage and non performance as well as other reasons.  The November 22, 2013 agreement which was signed both by CRA and GGCRL waives any demand on GGCRL for repayment of the Convertible Notes other than through the Signature transaction and audit process.  In addition, GGCRL and the Company have received contradictory representations as to the identity of the true owner of the funds advanced from Messrs Borkowski and Premraj.  The Convertible Notes themselves also provide for equal treatment,  coinvestment  of funds paid by the Company to GGCRL (Qualifying advances under the Convertible Notes require approval by a 75% of the GGCRL board.) On September 19, 2012, the CRA representative to the GGCRL board consented to an extension for the repayment of any debt to CRA until the sooner of September 19, 2013, a public listing of GGCRL, or a financing of GGCRL.  In April 2013, the Company had indirectly received an informal notice from a purported representative of CRA alleging a default under the Convertible Notes.  On June 18, 2013, GGC and GGCRL directly received a notice from the same purported CRA representative, Joseph Borkowski. On June 25, 2013, GGC, in a written response endorsed by Mr. Premraj, refuted (without dispute) the notice based on communications with CRA affiliated directors, lack of corporate authentication and contradictory corporate constitutional documentation which would prohibit GGC from recognizing Mr. Borkowski or Rasia FZE as in control of CRA. On July 1, 2013, GGC received written confirmation from a director of Consolidated Minerals Pte. Ltd. confirming that Consolidated Minerals Pte. Ltd. had funded the Convertible Notes to GGCRL, is the beneficial owner of those Notes, and reserves all legal rights to these Convertible Notes, not CRA. The owner, Mr. Premraj, and the representative of CRA, Jeffrey Marvin, signed the November 22, 2013 Merger Agreement with Signature Gold Limited which provided that repayment of the Convertible Notes and other GGCRL debt  will be audited and agreed then assumed by Signature Gold as part of this merger transaction. CRA blocked the closing of the Signature transaction, but its contractual agreement to be paid from that transaction supersedes GGCRL s.   
     
  Thus, while including certain amounts claimed to have been advanced in its financial statements to be conservative, the Company has taken the position that the claims to repayment of the Notes are without merit. Mr. Borkowski purportedly on behalf of CRA filed a lawsuit in the Royal Court of Jersey in attempt to enforce the Notes, but on June 18, 2014, the Royal Court of Jersey denied CRA s claim for a default judgment on the Notes and held the matter over. Subsequently, the entire case was dismissed in favor of GGC. Refer to Legal Proceedings for the dispute related to outstanding amount payable on Convertible Notes and advance payable matters.  
     
  On March 26, 2015, the Court of Appeals of the Island of Jersey ruled in the Company s favor in staying all proceedings and referring the claims initiated by Joseph Borkowski, purportedly on behalf of CRA to the contracted dispute resolution procedures in New York City. On the same day, the Court of Appeals also granted the Company its costs and fees for the entire proceedings with CRA. Approximately $50,000 has already been awarded to the Company against CRA (but not paid) and on November 3, 2016 an additional approximately $160,000 was awarded to GGC based on the Court of Appeals award. On May 27, 2015, the Court of Appeals of the Island of Jersey again ruled in the Company s favor refusing CRA s request for leave to appeal to the Queen s Privy Council. CRA requested the Queen s Privy Council for leave to appeal which was granted  , but on September 13, 2016 the Privy Council definitively dismissed all CRA claims in GGC s favor, again awarding fees and costs.   At the same time, on November 18, 2015, the Royal Court of Jersey ruled in favor of GGCRL, the Company, and Mr. Krikorian in lifting all remnants of the injunction issued in 2014 which was not appealed, see exhibit 10.76 below. The Company is pursuing awards of costs and attorney fees, which it is pursuing. CRA has not complied with the agreed dispute resolution provisions to commence in New York, despite the Company s initiation of the agreed mediation clause, see Subsequent Events for an update on this matter.  

16

8. ADVANCES PAYABLE CONSOLIDATED RESOURCES  
     
  In addition to the $1,500,000 received under the approved Convertible Notes, as describe in Note 7 above, the Company received additional advances of $394,244 which it is carrying this as a liability, though the Company reserves the right to contest this liability for fraud and offsetting amounts caused by damage and non performance as well as other reasons.  There is no written agreement on these Advances Payable Consolidated Resources and the Company has not accrued any interest on them accordingly. Refer to Note 14 - Legal Proceedings for the dispute related to outstanding amount payable on convertible note and advance payable and Subsequent Events.  
         
  9. NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  
     
   Formation of joint venture   
     
  On April 27, 2011, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with CR. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company received $5,000,000 and agreed to transfer 100% interests in Mego and Getik Mining Company, LLC into the Joint Venture Company. The Company recorded this transaction in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810,  Consolidation.   
     
   Transfer of interest   
     
  On September 26, 2012, the Company conditionally transferred 100% interests in Mego and Getik Mining Company, LLC at carrying value into the joint venture in accordance with ASC 805-50-30. According to ASC 805-50-30, when accounting for a transfer of assets between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets shall initially measure assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts at the date of transfer.  
     
   Consolidation of Joint Venture Company   
     
  The Company consolidates the Joint Venture Company in accordance with ASC 810 based on the determination that it controls the Joint Venture Company due to its 51% ownership interest and including the following characteristics:  

The noncontrolling interest lacks participation rights in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of business; and     

The noncontrolling interest does not have the ability to dissolve the Joint Venture Company     
       
   Recognize and measure noncontrolling interest   
     
  Changes in a parent s ownership interest while retaining its controlling financial interest are accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in its ownership interest in the subsidiary. The difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted is recognized as equity attributable to the parent. Further, the carrying amount of the accumulated other comprehensive income is adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interest in the subsidiary through a corresponding charge to equity attributable to the parent.  
     
  The following table summarizes the changes in Non-Controlling Interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

17

10. SEGMENT REPORTING BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA  
     
  The Company sells its products primarily to one customer in Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company operates in a single industry segment, production of gold and other precious metals including royalties from other non-affiliated Companies production of gold and other precious metals.  
     
  For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any revenue.  
     
  The following summarizes identifiable assets by geographic area:  

The following summarizes operating losses before provision for income tax:  

11. CONCENTRATION RISK  
     
  Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States and Armenia.  Bank deposits in the United States did not exceed federally insured limits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $44,850 and $6,160, respectively, in Armenian bank deposits which may not be insured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts through September 30, 2016 and as of the date of this filing.  
     
  The majority of the Company's present activities are in Armenia. As with all types of international business operations, currency fluctuations, exchange controls, restrictions on foreign investment, changes to tax regimes, political action and political instability could impair the value of the Company's investments.

13. AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS  
     
    Industrial Minerals/Linne/Jacero Agreements    
     
  On March 24, 2009, the Company signed a supply contract agreement with Industrial Minerals SA ( IM ), a Swiss Company.  The agreement is for IM to purchase all of the gold and silver concentrate produced at the Company's Toukhmanuk facility at 85% of LBMA less certain treatment and refining charges.    
     
  On February 25, 2010, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Mego entered into an agreement with IM to provide Mego with an advance of $450,000 from IM against future sales of gold and silver concentrate (the  Advance ).   The Advance was provided by IM on February 26, 2010.  The Company owed $87,020 from the Advance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  Key terms include; that Mego provides IM with an exclusive off-take agreement for its gold and silver concentrate in Armenia through December 31, 2012; for 2009 and until February 25, 2010, the price IM paid Mego for gold and silver concentrate was calculated based on 85% of the London AM/PM Gold Fixation and London Silver Spot ( London Rates ), until Mego delivers 2,250 metric tons of concentrate the 85% is reduced to 80%, after 2,250 metric tons have been delivered the price will revert to 85% of London Rates; Mego provides IM with a security interest in its current ore stockpile in Armenia; and the Company provides for a corporate guarantee for repayment of the Advance.  
     
  On July 5, 2013, the Company through its majority owned subsidiary Global Gold Consolidated Resources Limited, a Jersey Island private limited liability company ( GGCRL ), and GGCRL wholly owned subsidiaries GGCR Mining, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( GGCR Mining ), and Mego-Gold, LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Armenia ( Mego ), concluded a fifteen year mine operating agreement, all as further described in Exhibit 10.62 below, with Linne Mining LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Armenia ( Linne ), as the operator along with an $8,800,000 debt facilities agreement to fund future production at the central section of the Toukhmanuk gold-silver open pit mine in Armenia. The debt facility includes interest at LIBOR plus 8%, and the operator, Linne, has an incentive based compensation model, to be paid approved costs plus 10% of the actual sales of gold, all as further described in Exhibit 10.63 below. The Company has signed as a Guarantor on the debt facility agreement.  
     
  The existing offtake agreement with Industrial Minerals, SA was also extended until the end of 2027, all as further described in Exhibit 10.64 below, and share options for up to 10% in GGCRL or the subsidiary project company in Armenia were also granted in related agreements with Jacero Holdings Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus ( Jacero ), all as further described in Exhibit 10.65 below.   
     
  In January 2016 and since, the Company has been engaged with counsel for Linne Mining and Industrial Minerals to disclose the substantiation for amounts drawn under the Debt Facilities Agreement, reconcile evidence of misappropriation of funds by the mine contractor, comply with the Debt Facilities and Operating Agreements, pay the claims Global Gold has made for the breaches of Linne Mining and amicably resolve outstanding disputes without success.  The Company has taken the position that the agreed dispute resolution provisions starting with the 60 day good faith negotiating period commence upon provision of the material to substantiate the claims made by Linne Mining, but that information has not been forthcoming.   The refusal to turn over this required information has also affected our financial reporting in that we lack a basis to have capital and other expenses claimed by Linne Mining for the benefit of the project confirmed.  After the Company presented its position and evidence,  Linne advanced a claim of lost profits of approximately $30.6 million  Linne was contractually obligated to operate the mine and produce at certain levels agreed by the parties.  Linne utterly and admittedly failed to do so then abdicated as the evidence mounted that its former director Janiko Kaplanishvili was misappropriating funds.  We have also learned that from 2013-2015, he spent less than 45 days in the country not all of which were even at the mine site.  We have learned of the deception in attendance to agreed work as well as other fundamental breaches, including using funds drawn for project purposes for personal and other unrelated purposes. The $30.6 million claim is for lost profits based on the mine contractor s 10% bonus payment which was to be earned from production but the contractor for its own reasons and in violation of the agreement did not produce.  We are disclosing the claim to be transparent, but note that it was only made after the Company pointed out that the contractor failed to perform and owed us for our lost profit and other damages, of which their claim is only 10%.  If the matter is not amicably resolved, the Company will need to resort to legal recourse to extract the information being withheld and the monetary damages.  The contractor has totally left the mine site and the Company has full control, although we have maintained the contractor remains responsible under the contract.

Viking Investment/CREO Agreements    
     
  On July 5, 2013, GGCRL, and its wholly owned affiliates Mego, and Getik Mining Company, a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Armenia ( Getik ), also finalized an agreement effective June 20, 2013 with Creo Design (Pty) Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa ( CREO ), and Viking Investment Limited, a company incorporated in the Hong Kong ( Viking ). The agreement is for CREO to manage the technical work with local employees and contractors leading to feasibility studies at the Getik property in Armenia as well as at the 50 plus square kilometer exploration license area surrounding the central section of the Toukhmanuk mine.   The Armenian government recently extended this exploration license to July 2, 2016 and the English and Armenian of the current license have been posted on the Global Gold website. The agreement also calls for Viking to finance the initial budgeted expenses until GGCRL is publicly listed at a charge of costs plus 10%, all as further described in Exhibit 10.66 below.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and as of the date of this Report, Viking and CREO have failed to meet their obligations and are in material breach of the contract. The Company is reviewing its options with respect to the breaches of contract.  
       
    Caldera Agreements    
     
  On November 10, 2014, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Final Award, with retired Justice Herman Cahn as the sole arbitrator, ruled in favor of Global Gold on damages and a range of other outstanding issues. The total damage award is $10,844,413 with interest at 9% and penalties continuing to accrue if Caldera does not comply with the equitable relief granted. Of the total damage award, $3 million is compensation and $1 million is punitive damages for the defamatory publications by Caldera's principal Vasilios Bill Mavridis against Global Gold and its principals. This Final Award terminates the arbitration proceedings which Caldera instituted against Global Gold in 2010. Global Gold prevailed in the first, liability phase of the arbitration and four prior court cases, as summarized and reported in April 2013. A full copy of the 42 page Final Award as well as the other rulings is available at the Global Gold website: www.globalgoldcorp.com. Previous rulings in this matter included that Montreal based Caldera Resources, led by the brothers John Mavridis and Bill Mavridis, failed to make agreed payments to Global Gold despite having raised almost $5 million, failed to issue stock due, misrepresented the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange of the parties' contract, and otherwise breached the joint venture agreement. Caldera through its Biomine, LLC subsidiary also acquired a "Marjan West" license area which it claimed was adjacent to Marjan but in fact overlapped with Marjan. Armenian Courts at three levels found that Caldera had deceptively and illegally registered full control over the Marjan Mining Company to itself without the signatures or authorization of Global Gold, and a U.S. Federal Court confirmed the phase 1 arbitration findings while rejecting Caldera's arguments to vacate the award. The November 10, 2014 Final Award resolved all other outstanding issues with the following specific findings and rulings requiring Caldera to:  

1.   
 
  turn over to Global Gold at its offices in Rye, New York all books, records, contracts, communications, and property related in any way to the Marjan property in Armenia and the Marjan Mining Company, including specifically the Armenian Marjan Mining Company seal, and shall pay Global Gold $50,000 plus $250 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such materials are not delivered;     

2.   
 
  turn over to Global Gold at its offices in Rye, New York communications Caldera and/or Mr. Mavridis has had with third parties concerning Global Gold its officers, agents, directors and business Without limitation, the following shall also be turned over to Global Gold: all direct and indirect (for example through a translator or agent) communications with the following individuals and organizations: Azat Vartanian, Petros Vartanian,  , Joseph Borkowski, Jeffrey Marvin,  Prem Premraj , Rasia FZE, Johan Ulander, Ecolur,  Tom Prutzman,  , Stockhouse, Investor's Hub, shareholders of Global Gold, and any governmental or regulatory authorities-- Caldera shall pay Global Gold $100 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such materials are not delivered;     

3.   
 
  issue a press release correcting the April 30, 2013 Caldera release  stating that the original release is retracted with all property books and records (including all exploration data) related to the Marjan property transferred to Global Gold and that neither Caldera nor its successors retain rights to the Marjan mine in Armenia and shall pay Global Gold $50,000 plus $100 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such correcting release is not issued;       

23

4.   
 
  Caldera did not spend the minimum $1 million threshold necessary to be eligible for an NSR Royalty interest and therefore Caldera has no NSR Royalty or any other interest in the Marjan property;     

5.   
 
  the $150,000 which Caldera paid to Global Gold was not pursuant to the JV Agreement (which did not become effective) but pursuant to the December 2009 Agreement therefore Global Gold is not obligated to make any payments to Caldera;     

8.   
 
  pay Global Gold $577,174 for legacy governmental liabilities concerning the Marjan property and shall indemnify and hold Global Gold harmless (including attorney fees) from any governmental claims or liabilities associated with the time they control the seal of the Marjan Mining Company;     

9.   
 
  pay Global Gold $967,345 for violating Paragraph (1) of the Final Partial Award requiring turnover of property and [for] interference in Global Gold's development of Marjan and shall relinquish the portions of the Marjan West license which overlap or in any way impinge on Marjan;     

10.   
 
  Caldera is liable for defamation and tortious interference with contractual and business relations with regard to Global Gold and its related personnel and so shall (i) pay Global Gold $3 million in compensatory damages , (ii) pay Global Gold $1 million in punitive or exemplary damages , (iii) remove all the materials and websites controlled in any way by them which were admitted as exhibits on defamatory publications in this case from the internet and other locations, (iv) remove and be permanently enjoined from using Global Gold's trading symbol without permission; (v) not share those materials with others or arrange to have them posted anonymously or otherwise- (vi) independently,   Global Gold and those who have been named by Caldera and Bill Mavridis in the admitted exhibits on defamatory publications as well as their attorneys [are granted] the authority to contact internet service providers, search engine firms, social media sites, stock discussion boards (including but not limited to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Stockhouse, Investor's Hub and Bing) to use this Final Award to remove the material as defamatory;     

11.   
 
  for the breaches of the Confidentiality Stipulations and Orders in this case,  all publications of "confidential" or attorney eyes only material [shall] be removed from the internet and any other locations and that their substance not be republished and  Global Gold and its attorneys [are granted] the authority to contact internet service providers, search engine firms, social media sites, stock discussions board (including but not limited to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Stockhouse, Investor's Hub and Bing) to use this Final Award to remove the material-- Caldera shall pay Global Gold for $100 per day every day that persons associated with Caldera remain in violation of the Confidentiality Stipulation and Order following the issuance of this Final Award including for each day until full disclosure of all emails and other communications with third parties that the information was shared with or discussed;     

13.   
 
  reimburse Global Gold $88,269 paid to the arbitration association and for the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator.     
     
  The Final Award was certified for purposes of Article I of the United Nations New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and for purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act. Caldera has not complied with the Final Award.

  On October 26, 2012, the shares of Mego and Getik were registered, subject to terms and conditions as stated in the transfer documents, with the State Registry of the Republic of Armenia, as being fully owned by GGCR Mining.  The registration was completed after approval was given by ABB which required Global Gold to guaranty the ABB line of credit payable. CRA failed to meet the terms and conditions. The terms and conditions included, but were not limited to, (a) funding the one year budget, (b) funding the loan payments due to ABB bank in Armenia, (c) performance of employment agreements, (d) the plans for a public listing of the parent company of GGCR Mining ( GGCRL ) by June 30, 2013 (authorized as on the AIM exchange in London), (e) reimbursement of Global Gold Corporation for all payments made on behalf of GGCR Mining and related entities as well as payment of all accrued and unpaid obligations to contractors, auditors, counsel and CSA, and (f) that in connection with the public listing of GGCRL by June 30, 2013, GGCRL would issue to GGC additional shares in an amount equal to the greater of 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company upon the financing or issuances of shares in a public listing or a reverse merger or additional shares and/or after distributing shares or options to employees or consultants, so together with shares currently owned by GGC, thirty days after public trading of shares, shall equal based upon the average weighted value thereof as defined in the JV Agreement the greater of 51% or the value of $40,000,000. The terms and conditions were signed by Caralapti Premraj who is the representative of Consolidated Resources.  
     
  Consolidated Resources failed to meet each of the terms and conditions noted above. For example, As of September 30, 2013, the balance due on advances from Global Gold Corporation was $5,244,865 plus accrued interest of $164,224, none of which was paid. Global Gold had to cover the ABB payments, and there was obviously no public listing on AIM by June 30, 2013.  
     
  Without waiving any of its rights, Global Gold allowed Consolidated Resouces to work to cure its failures in 2013 and on November 22, 2013 the parties signed an agreement with Signature Gold (also described in our SEC filings) in which Global Gold would have been paid and waived the multiple breaches by Consolidated Resources; however, Consolidated Resources frustrated the closing of that transaction and the audit of GGCRL. In addition, as described elsewhere in our SEC filings, the Company has discovered that Consolidated Resources engaged in a pattern of fraud. In addition to the multiple material breaches of terms and conditions outlined above, the fraudulent acts also vitiate Global Gold s obligations to Consolidated Resources. In addition, Mr. Premraj abandoned his duties as a director of GGCRL by not engaging or communicating with GGCRL, GGCRM, or Global Gold in early 2014 when he refused to attend the directors and shareholders  meetings to consider and approve the audit required by the November 2013 Signature Merger and Sale Agreement.  
     
  As of April 11, 2015, ABB Bank has released all of its security interests in the Company s properties in Armenia. As a result, Linne Mining has moved up to the priority position as a secured creditor.

Rent Agreements    
     
  On April 1, 2011, the Company moved its corporate headquarters from Greenwich, CT to 555 Theodore Fremd Avenue, Rye, NY 10580.  The new lease was for five years and had annual costs of; $63,045 in year 1, $64,212 in year 2, $65,380 in year 3, $66,547 in year 4, and $67,715 in year 5. As of November 1, 2015, the Company moved its offices from Suite C-208 to Suite C-305 at the same 555 Theodore Fremd Avenue, Rye, NY building and extended its lease for five years commencing November 1, 2015, at a starting annual rent cost of $77,409, see exhibit 10.75.  
     
  The following is a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2016:  

14. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
     
   CRA Related   
     
  All CRA initiated litigation in Jersey has been resolved in the Company s favor as of September 13, 2016, except regarding collection of fees and costs against CRA. On January 6, 2014, the Company received notice from Mr. Borkowski that the amount due to CRA in accordance with the Convertible Notes was $2,197,453 plus interest $933,942 at 15% neither of which the Company believes is valid and is only carrying the $1,500,000 in Notes plus the $394,244 of Advances payable. The January 6, 2014 notice from Mr. Borkowski acknowledges that amounts above $1,500,000 are  uncertificated.  No Company approval or adequate substantiation for crediting the difference of $1,894,244 and $2,197,453 as amount due under the Convertible Notes or as Advances has been provided. The Company and GGC have also raised fraud issues with CR which have not been resolved; if unresolved, the fraud issues would vitiate CR s rights and create liabilities. A draft audit report was prepared, but both CRA and its director Mr. Premraj each failed to attend two shareholder and board meetings to consider the draft report. The February 27, 2014 shareholder and board meetings were adjourned in accordance with the Articles and when the shareholder meeting reconvened on March 7, 2014 the Company voted its majority shares to approve the draft audit report. On March 10, 2014, Mr. Borkowski purportedly on behalf of CRA received an  Order of Justice  and injunction from the Royal Court of Jersey against GGCRL, the Executive Chairman of GGCRL and the Company enjoining it from certain activities. The order was applied for and received on an ex parte basis without giving any of the defendants notice or opportunity to be heard and based on incomplete and fraudulent representations. Neither Mr. Premraj who was consistently represented as the owner of CRA or Mr. Marvin who signed every agreement on behalf of CRA submitted a sworn statement in support of CRA or Mr. Borkowski so there are additional concerns about fraud and misrepresentation as well as counterparty risk. GGCRL matters are subject to a broad arbitration agreement, and the Company has triggered the dispute resolution provisions of the 2011 JVA as well as subsequent arbitration agreements, and the arbitration agreement has been upheld by the Jersey courts. The Jersey legal action is considered to be a bad faith tactic, not based in law or fact, and designed only to extract extra legal advantages against the Company. On April 2, 2014, the aspects of the ex parte injunction affecting operations were lifted. The Company is still considering its legal options with respect to CRA as well as the individuals who have misled the Company, frustrated the GGCRL joint venture as well as the November 2013 merger agreement with Signature, and breached the relevant agreements. The Company is also aware that Mr. Borkowski has attempted to buy the Mego Gold ABB loan from the ABB bank (since repaid in full), has materially interfered in the Company s contractual and business affairs and is cooperating with Mr. Mavridis and Caldera Resources in issuing defamatory material on the internet and elsewhere against the Company and its principals. The Company has also received registry documents showing that in 2012 Mr. Borkowski established a company with Caldera's representative to Armenia named the "Aparan Mining Company." The Company has also received additional information on Mr. Borkowski s activities relative to damaging the Company and attempting to misappropriate its assets in Armenia.  

28

In the Jersey legal action, Mr. Borkowski attempted to obtain judgment on the Convertible Notes claim for CRA, but the court denied that attempt and held the issue over in a judgment dated June 18, 2014; the court awarded the Company its costs in defending the attempt by Mr. Borkowski purportedly on behalf of CRA.  
     
  On March 26, 2015, the Court of Appeals of the Island of Jersey ruled in the Company s favor in staying all proceedings and referring the claims initiated by Joseph Borkowski, purportedly on behalf of CRA to the contracted dispute resolution procedures in New York City. On the same day, the Court of Appeals also granted the Company its costs and fees for the entire proceedings with CRA. Approximately $50,000 has already been awarded to the Company against CRA (but not paid) with a further award of $230,000 based on the Court of Appeals award and additional amounts pending.  
     
  On April 22, 2015, the Victoria Legal Services Commission in Australia found that the attorney Mr. Premraj chose to represent GGCRL in the Signature Gold transaction, Charles Wantrup, who acted to the detriment of the Company, engaged in  unsatisfactory professional conduct.   
     
  On May 27, 2015, the Court of Appeals of the Island of Jersey again ruled in the Company s favor refusing CRA s request for leave to appeal to the Queen s Privy Council. CRA requested the Queen s Privy Council for leave to appeal which was granted. On July 20, 2015, in accordance with the CRA Agreements and the Jersey Court of Appeals decisions, the Company instituted a mediation process with CRA at the American Arbitration Association in New York City. In a further material breach of the CRA Agreements, CRA refused to participate in the mediation. At the same time, On November 18, 2015, the Royal Court of Jersey ruled in favor of GGCRL, the Company, and Mr. Krikorian in lifting all remnants of the injunction issued in 2014 which was not appealed, see exhibit 10.76 below. The Company has been awarded its costs and attorney fees, which it is pursuing.   
     
  On September 13, 2016, the United Kingdom  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  ( JCPC ) issued an order and opinion finally dismissing the action which Joseph Borkowski filed and pursued purportedly on behalf of CRA in Island of Jersey against GGCRL, the Company, and Van Krikorian.  (JCPC # 2015/0075).  The JCPC dismissed the Borkowski/CRA action with prejudice and like the lower courts granted the Company and Mr. Krikorian their costs and legal fees.  This fully terminates the Jersey litigation in favor of the Company and Mr. Krikorian except for the calculation and collection of costs and legal fees.      
     
  The Company has reengaged in settlement discussions to resolve disputes with the beneficial owner of CRA, Caralapti (Prem) Premraj and Jeffrey Marvin, who signed all of the relevant contracts with the Company on behalf of CRA.   See Subsequent Events.  
     
   Amarant and Alluvia Related   
     
  On August 6, 2013, the American Arbitration Association International Centre for Dispute Resolution issued a Partial Final Award in favor of the Company for $2,512,312 as a liquidated principal debt plus 12% interest and excluding any additional damages, attorney fees, or costs which will be discussed at a later time. Additionally, the American Arbitration Association enjoined Amarant and Alluvia from assigning or alienating any assets or performing or entering transactions which would have the effect of alienating its respective assets pending payment of $2,512,312 to Global Gold. Amarant and Alluvia have not complied with the arbitral award to pay, produce records, or, apparently, enter transactions pending payment in full to Global Gold. Subsequent to the arbitral award, Amarant and Alluvia announced on the Amarant website in 2013 that  [t]he companies have reached an agreement with a UAE based consortium to sell material parts of their assets. The deal was signed on the 30th September in London and consists of three parts. The first stage consists of the sales of the shares in Mineral Invest and Alluvia that are pledged as security for various bridge financing solutions and short term financing. In a second stage the consortium will provide the operational companies MII and Alluvia with necessary funding to start the operations and settle off short term debts and obligations in Alluvia and Mineral Invest including, but not limited to, legal fees to the SOVR law firm, license fees, funds owed to Global Gold related to the purchase of the Valdevia, Chile property and remaining payments against NSR commitments in connection with the Huakan deal. The first two stages are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.  Global Gold was contacted by Mr. Ulander and separately by the former Chairman of Alluvia, Mr. Thomas Dalton, as the representative of the consortium, Gulf Resource Capital, referenced in the Amarant/Alluvia announcement to settle the arbitration award and despite the expectation of payments, no payments were made by December 31, 2013 and the parties have not reached a definitive agreement. There can be no assurance that Gulf Resource Capital will pay on behalf of Amarant and Alluvia, Global Gold will continue to seek enforcement of the arbitral award to the full extent as well as pursue its claims of additional damages in the ongoing arbitration.  

29

On June 26, 2014, the International Center for Dispute Resolution International Arbitration Tribunal delivered a Final Award in the matter of Global Gold Corporation vs. Amarant Mining LTD and Alluvia Mining, Ltd. awarding Global Gold $16,800,000 USD plus $68,570.25 USD in interest, costs, and fess, with post-award interest on unpaid amounts accruing at 9%. In addition, the Tribunal provided the following injunctive relief:   Per my previous orders in this matter, each of Amarant and Alluvia, including its officers and agents individually (including without limitation Johan Ulander), is continued to be enjoined, directly and indirectly, from alienating any assets, from transferring or consenting to the transfer of any shares, or performing or entering any transactions which would have the effect of alienating assets pending payment to Global Gold; each of Amarant and Alluvia, including its officers and agents (including without limitation Johan Ulander) will provide within 5 business days all contracts, draft agreements, emails, records of financial transactions, financial statements, and all other documents in connection with their business affairs for purposes of determining whether Respondents have complied with the July 29, 2013 and subsequent orders, have diverted funds which could have been used to pay Global Gold, and to aid Global Gold in collection. Respondents shall specifically provide of all documents related to Gulf Resource Capital, Amarant Finance, the IGE Resources stock sale and related transactions as well as documents related to the institutions from which Respondents have represented payment would issue including but not limited to: Mangold, Swedebank, Jool Capital, Skandinavska Bank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Volksbank, Loyal Bank, Danskebank, NSBO, the  offtaker,  and Clifford Chance escrow account. Respondents shall execute any documents reasonably necessary or required by any institution to give Claimant access to this information and documents  all as more particularly set out in Exhibit 10.68.  
     
  On September 10, 2015, the Company notified Intacta Kapital AB of Stockholm of its continuing obligation to pay Global Gold on the Contender guaranty of the Amarant group.  
     
  The Company is actively pursuing worldwide enforcement of the monetary award and injunctive relief granted as well as payment on the Intacta/Contender guaranty.  
       
   Hankavan Related    
     
  In 2006, GGH, which was the license holder for the Hankavan and Marjan properties, was the subject of corrupt and improper demands and threats from the now former Minister of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Armenia, Vardan Ayvazian. The Company reported this situation to the appropriate authorities in Armenia and in the United States. Although the Minister took the position that the licenses at Hankavan and Marjan were terminated, other Armenian governmental officials assured the Company to the contrary and Armenian public records confirmed the continuing validity of the licenses. The Company received independent legal opinions that all of its licenses were valid and remained in full force and effect, continued to work at those properties, and engaged international and local counsel to pursue prosecution of the illegal and corrupt practices directed against the subsidiary, including international arbitration. On November 7, 2006, the Company initiated the thirty-day good faith negotiating period (which is a prerequisite to filing for international arbitration under the 2003 SHA, LLC Share Purchase Agreement) with the three named shareholders and one previously undisclosed principal, Mr. Ayvazian.  The Company filed for arbitration under the rules under the International Chamber of Commerce, headquartered in Paris, France ("ICC"), on December 29, 2006.  On September 25, 2008, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Mr. Ayvazian was required to appear as a respondent in the ICC arbitration.  On September 5, 2008, the ICC International Court of Arbitration ruled that Mr. Ayvazian shall be a party in accordance with the decision rendered on September 25, 2008 by the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Subsequently, in December 2011 the ICC Tribunal decided to proceed only with the three named shareholders; in March 2012, GGM filed an action in Federal District Court pursuant to that Court s decisions for damages against Ayvazian and/or to conform the ICC Tribunal to the precedents, and on July 11, 2012 the Federal Court entered judgment in favor of the Company, which was not appealed.  Based on the evidence of the damages suffered as a result of Ayvazyan s actions, the final $37,537,978.02 federal court judgment in favor of GGM is comprised of $27,152,244.50 in compensatory damages plus $10,385,734.52 of interest at 9% from 2008.  On September 6, 2012, the United States Marshal Service for the Southern District of New York filed for service a Writ of Execution to be enforced against Mr. Vardan Ayvazyan in favor of GGM.  The Writ of Execution was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York following the order and judgment of Judge J. Paul Oetken and final entry of that judgment (No. 12,1260).   The terms of the Writ of Execution and the Thirty Seven Million Five Hundred  Thirty Seven Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy Eight dollars and Two cents ($37,537,978.02) amount of the judgment in favor of GGM are more particularly described in Exhibit 10.56 below. On November 21, 2013, the Company received from its attorneys the  without prejudice  ruling of the Judge J. Paul Oetken of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which vacated the $37.5 million default judgment which the Company had obtained against former Armenian Minister of Environment Vartan Ayvazian solely on jurisdictional grounds.  The ruling is expressly  without prejudice  to Global Gold s right to re-file or continue to pursue the case.  The court did not rule on the corruption charges or damage amount caused by Ayvazian s actions, basing its findings on Ayvazian s general insufficient contacts with New York.  One of the shareholders of the   

30

Armenian party to the agreement under which the Company brought suit against Ayvazian identified him as the undisclosed principal who controlled the transaction and divided the funds paid by Global Gold. The November 21, 2013 court ruling also did not address those facts. This ruling has no effect on the Company s financial statements as this judgment was never recorded on the Company s books.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York subsequently confirmed the dismissal  without prejudice  to the Company, and the Company continues to consider its options.  
       
  Based on the US Armenia Bilateral Investment Treaty, GGM filed a request for arbitration against the Republic of Armenia for the actions of the former Minister of Environment and Natural Resources with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is a component agency of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. ("ICSID"), on January 29, 2007. On August 31, 2007, the Government of Armenia and GGM jointly issued the following statement, "[they] jointly announce that they have suspended the ICSID arbitration pending conclusion of a detailed settlement agreement. The parties have reached a confidential agreement in principle, and anticipate that the final settlement agreement will be reached within 10 days of this announcement." The Company has learned from public records that GeoProMining Ltd., through an affiliate, has become the sole shareholder of an Armenian Company, Golden Ore, LLC, which was granted a license for Hankavan. GeoProMining Ltd. is subject to the 20% obligations as successor to Sterlite Resources, Ltd.  As of February 25, 2008, GGM entered into a conditional, confidential settlement agreement with the Government of the Republic of Armenia to discontinue the ICSID arbitration proceedings, which were discontinued as of May 2, 2008. This agreement did not affect the ICC arbitration or litigation involving similar subject matter.  
     
   Marjan Related   
     
  Effective September 7, 2016, the Company through its Marjan Mining Company subsidiary and the Armenian Government through its Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources concluded amendments to the Marjan mining agreement which among other things provides that the Company: (1) has 3 years from September 1, 2016 to build the approved tailings dam and plant; (2) has 3.4 years  following the completion of the tailings dam and plant to mine 160,000 tonnes of ore from the Marjan mine, pursuant to the approved mining plan; (3) has 12 months to prepare and file for a report for recalculation of existing Marjan reserves, based on exploration results; and (4) has 12 months  following the approval by the State Committee on Natural Resources  approval (which must be issued within 12 months of the Company s recalculation) to prepare and file an updated and mining plan, all as more particularly described in Exhibit 10.78.  Any delays the government takes that shall extend the relevant terms.  This amendment also resolves the overlapping license issue caused by Caldera Resources and its Biomine subsidiary which was determined in the Company s favor by the New York ICDR arbitral award. Please see our  Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors  on our website and Form 10-K with regard to the SEC and other standards for the term  reserve.   
     
  Based on a false representation by Caldera, on June 17, 2010, Global Gold Corporation and its subsidiary, GGM, LLC (collectively  Global ) and Caldera Resources, Inc. ( Caldera ) announced TSX-V approval of their March 24, 2010 joint venture agreement to explore and bring the Marjan property into commercial production.  As previously reported, the property is held with a twenty-five year  special mining license,  effective April 22, 2008, and expiring April 22, 2033, which expanded the prior license term and substantially increased the license area.  The license required payments of annual governmental fees and the performance of work at the property as submitted and approved in the mining plan, which includes mining of 50,000 tonnes of mineralized rock per year, as well as exploration work to have additional reserves approved under Armenian Law in order to maintain the licenses in good standing.  Caldera advised Global as well as governmental authorities that it would not be complying with the work requirements which prompted 90 day termination notices from the government and the October 7, 2010 joint venture termination notice from Global, which Global had agreed to keep the termination notice confidential until October 15, 2010.    
     
  The joint venture agreement provided that Caldera would be solely responsible for license compliance and conducting the approved mining plan, and that  [i]n the event that Caldera does not, or is otherwise unable to, pursue this project and pay to Global Gold the amounts provided for hereunder, Caldera s rights to the Property and the shares of Marjan-Caldera Mining LLC shall be forfeited and replaced by a Net Smelter Royalty (the  NSR ).  Caldera did not meet the threshold to earn any NSR under the agreement, and its notice of license non-compliance as well as its failure to pay resulted in an automatic termination of its rights by operation of the agreement.  The agreement provided that Caldera would deliver 500,000 of its shares to Global,  subject to final approvals of this agreement by the TSX Venture Exchange.  Caldera advised that the TSX Venture Exchange approval was issued in June 2010 and Caldera failed to deliver the shares.  Subject to a 30 day extension if it could not raise the funds in capital markets, Caldera agreed to make a $300,000 payment to the Company on September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010; $250,000 on March 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 30, 2011, March 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, and September 30, 2012; and $500,000 on December 31, 2012.  Caldera raised sufficient funds, but did not make these payments.  
     
  The agreement was subject to approval by the TSX Venture Exchange and the Board of Directors of the respective companies.  Caldera further informed the Company that it received TSX Venture Exchange approval on the transaction, which subsequently proved to be untrue.  On October   

31

7, 2010, the Company terminated the Marjan JV for Caldera s non-payment and non-performance as well as Caldera s illegal registrations in Armenia and other actions.  In October 2010, Caldera filed for arbitration in New York City.  In September 2010, at Caldera s invitation, the Company filed to reverse the illegal registration in Armenia.  That litigation and the New York arbitration were subsequently resolved in favor of the Company, restoring the Company s 100% ownership of Marjan.    
       
  In a final, non-appealable decision issued and effective February 8, 2012, the Armenian Court of Cassation affirmed the July 29, 2011 Armenian trial court and December 12, 2012 Court of Appeals decisions which ruled that Caldera's registration and assumption of control through unilateral charter changes of the Marjan Mine and Marjan Mining Company, LLC were illegal and that ownership rests fully with GGM.  The official versions of the Armenian Court decisions are available through  http://www.datalex.am   /  , with English translations available on the Company s website.   
     
  On March 29, 2012, in the independent New York City arbitration case Global Gold received a favorable ruling in its arbitration proceeding in New York with Caldera which is available on the Company's website, see Exhibit 10.48. The arbitrator issued a Partial Final Award which orders the Marjan Property in Armenia to revert to GGM based on the two failures to meet conditions precedent to the March 24, 2010 agreement.  First, Caldera failed and refused to deliver the 500,000 shares to Global. Second, Caldera did not submit the final joint venture agreement to the TSX-V for approval until the middle of the arbitration proceedings, instead relying on superseded versions in its regulatory submissions and submitting  Form 5Cs  to the TSX-V which were false representations of Caldera s obligations to Global.   
     
  The Partial Award states  By misrepresenting its payment obligations to the TSX-V, Caldera painted a false financial picture to the TSX-V and the investing public.   In addition, the arbitrator found that had he not come to the conclusions above,  Caldera and its officers effectively breached the JV Agreement and the terms of the Limited Liability Agreement  in multiple ways, including Caldera s failure to make quarterly payments to Global.   
     
  The Partial Award orders reversion of the Marjan property to Global, return of amounts paid to Global by Caldera returned as the JV Agreement did not go into effect, an Net Smelter Royalty to Caldera of 0.5% for each tranche of $1 million actually spent on the property, and further proceedings on Global s claims for damages with additional hearings currently set to begin July 11, 2012.  As previously reported, Global s records establish that Caldera did not spend $1 million on the Marjan property.  Additionally, tax returns filed by Caldera in Armenia report less than $400,000 spent on the property.  The parties' arbitration agreement further provides that the award  shall be final and non-appealable  and for the award of attorney fees, arbitrator s fees, and other costs.  In accordance with the Arbitrator's order and the JV agreement, Global Gold has filed to confirm the Partial Final Award in Federal Court.  Caldera is opposing the confirmation.  The amounts paid to Global by Caldera total $150,000 and is included in the Company s accounts payable, although they are disputed and offset by damages and other amounts due by Caldera to the Company.  
     
  In an Opinion and Order signed on April 15, 2013 and released on April 17, 2013, U.S. Federal Judge Kenneth M. Karas of the Southern District of New York confirmed the March 29, 2012 American Arbitration Association arbitration award issued by retired Justice Herman Cahn which, among other things, stated that  [t]he property should revert to [Global Gold] within thirty (30) days from the date [of the arbitration award   by April 29, 2012].  Obviously, [Global Gold] may cause the appropriate governmental bodies in Armenia to register the property in [Global Gold s] name.  All as further described in the exhibit 10.61 below.  
     
  The Company has reestablished control of Marjan Mining Company which is the license holder of the Marjan property.  A new mining license, valid until April 22, 2033, has been issued to the Company.  The Company's control has not been established over certain property, records, financial and tax information, or other assets maintained by Caldera such as warehouse and drill core as Caldera has failed to turn over such property despite being ordered to do so.  The Company is proceeding with plans to mine in compliance with the mining license, and implement additional exploration to the best of its ability.  The Company is also taking legal action to protect its rights in an adjacent territory indentified as  Marjan West  for which Caldera has publicly claimed to have a license but according to public, on-line government records, the company holding the license is 100% owned by another person.  
     
  Caldera has also publicly claimed that it continues to have rights to the Marjan property based on the parties  December 2009 agreement, but that agreement to agree was merged into the March 2010 agreement, called for completion of payments by Caldera by the end of 2012, and included other terms which Caldera cannot meet.  Caldera s attempt to raise this issue in the arbitral proceedings following the March 29, 2012 decision in Global Gold s favor has not succeeded.  Caldera and its officers and agents have also continued a defamatory campaign of harassment and filing of false claims over the internet and elsewhere against the Company and its officials which may be pursued during the damages phase of the arbitration.   

32

On November 10, 2014, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Final Award, with retired Justice Herman Cahn as the sole arbitrator, ruled in favor of Global Gold on damages and a range of other outstanding issues to finally resolve all outstanding issues. The total damage award is $10,844,413 with interest at 9% and penalties continuing to accrue if Caldera does not comply with the equitable relief granted. Of the total damage award, $3 million is compensation and $1 million is punitive damages for the defamatory publications by Caldera's principal Vasilios Bill Mavridis against Global Gold and its principals. This Final Award terminates the arbitration proceedings which Caldera instituted against Global Gold in 2010. Global Gold prevailed in the first, liability phase of the arbitration and four prior court cases, as summarized and reported in April 2013. A full copy of the 42 page Final Award as well as the other rulings is available at the Global Gold website: www.globalgoldcorp.com. Previous rulings in this matter included that Montreal based Caldera Resources, led by the brothers John Mavridis and Bill Mavridis, failed to make agreed payments to Global Gold despite having raised almost $5 million, failed to issue stock due, misrepresented the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange of the parties' contract, and otherwise breached the joint venture agreement. Caldera through its Biomine, LLC subsidiary also acquired a "Marjan West" license area which it claimed was adjacent to Marjan but in fact overlapped with Marjan. Armenian Courts at three levels found that Caldera had deceptively and illegally registered full control over the Marjan Mining Company to itself without the signatures or authorization of Global Gold, and a U.S. Federal Court confirmed the phase 1 arbitration findings while rejecting Caldera's arguments to vacate the award. The November 10, 2014 Final Award resolved all other outstanding issues with the following specific findings and rulings requiring Caldera to:  

1.   
 
  turn over to Global Gold at its offices in Rye, New York all books, records, contracts, communications, and property related in any way to the Marjan property in Armenia and the Marjan Mining Company, including specifically the Armenian Marjan Mining Company seal, and shall pay Global Gold $50,000 plus $250 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such materials are not delivered;     

2.   
 
  turn over to Global Gold at its offices in Rye, New York communications Caldera and/or Mr. Mavridis has had with third parties concerning Global Gold its officers, agents, directors and business Without limitation, the following shall also be turned over to Global Gold: all direct and indirect (for example through a translator or agent) communications with the following individuals and organizations: Azat Vartanian, Petros Vartanian,  , Joseph Borkowski, Jeffrey Marvin,  Prem Premraj , Rasia FZE, Johan Ulander, Ecolur,  Tom Prutzman,  , Stockhouse, Investor's Hub, shareholders of Global Gold, and any governmental or regulatory authorities-- Caldera shall pay Global Gold $100 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such materials are not delivered;     

3.   
 
  issue a press release correcting the April 30, 2013 Caldera release  stating that the original release is retracted with all property books and records (including all exploration data) related to the Marjan property transferred to Global Gold and that neither Caldera nor its successors retain rights to the Marjan mine in Armenia and shall pay Global Gold $50,000 plus $100 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such correcting release is not issued;     

4.   
 
  Caldera did not spend the minimum $1 million threshold necessary to be eligible for an NSR Royalty interest and therefore Caldera has no NSR Royalty or any other interest in the Marjan property;     

5.   
 
  the $150,000 which Caldera paid to Global Gold was not pursuant to the JV Agreement (which did not become effective) but pursuant to the December 2009 Agreement therefore Global Gold is not obligated to make any payments to Caldera;     

8.   
 
  pay Global Gold $577,174 for legacy governmental liabilities concerning the Marjan property and shall indemnify and hold Global Gold harmless (including attorney fees) from any governmental claims or liabilities associated with the time they control the seal of the Marjan Mining Company;     

33

9.   
 
  pay Global Gold $967,345 for violating Paragraph (1) of the Final Partial Award requiring turnover of property and [for] interference in Global Gold's development of Marjan and shall relinquish the portions of the Marjan West license which overlap or in any way impinge on Marjan;     

10.   
 
  Caldera is liable for defamation and tortious interference with contractual and business relations with regard to Global Gold and its related personnel and so shall (i) pay Global Gold $3 million in compensatory damages , (ii) pay Global Gold $1 million in punitive or exemplary damages , (iii) remove all the materials and websites controlled in any way by them which were admitted as exhibits on defamatory publications in this case from the internet and other locations, (iv) remove and be permanently enjoined from using Global Gold's trading symbol without permission; (v) not share those materials with others or arrange to have them posted anonymously or otherwise- (vi) independently,   Global Gold and those who have been named by Caldera and Bill Mavridis in the admitted exhibits on defamatory publications as well as their attorneys [are granted] the authority to contact internet service providers, search engine firms, social media sites, stock discussion boards (including but not limited to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Stockhouse, Investor's Hub and Bing) to use this Final Award to remove the material as defamatory;     

11.   
 
  for the breaches of the Confidentiality Stipulations and Orders in this case,  all publications of "confidential" or attorney eyes only material [shall] be removed from the internet and any other locations and that their substance not be republished and  Global Gold and its attorneys [are granted] the authority to contact internet service providers, search engine firms, social media sites, stock discussions board (including but not limited to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Stockhouse, Investor's Hub and Bing) to use this Final Award to remove the material-- Caldera shall pay Global Gold for $100 per day every day that persons associated with Caldera remain in violation of the Confidentiality Stipulation and Order following the issuance of this Final Award including for each day until full disclosure of all emails and other communications with third parties that the information was shared with or discussed;     

13.   
 
  reimburse Global Gold $88,269 paid to the arbitration association and for the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator.     
     
  The Final Award was certified for purposes of Article I of the United Nations New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and for purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act. The Company is actively pursuing enforcement of the monetary damages and injunctive relief granted.  
        
   Armenian Tax Authority Related   
     
  On January 12, 2012, the Armenian Court of Cassation confirmed prior trial and appellate court rulings rejecting a proposed tax assessment against the Company s Mego-Gold subsidiary by the Armenian State Revenue Agency related to an incorrect claim concerning gold production at Toukhmanuk as well as incorrect applications of relevant law.  Subsequently, the State Revenue agency has continued investigations and intimated that it is investigating and may make further claims against the Company based on the same matters previously adjudicated in the Company s favor as well as based on claims initiated and related to Caldera Resources and its agents during and after legal proceedings in which the Company prevailed against Caldera.   Independent legal counsel has been engaged on these matters, and the Company considers that it has no liabilities in connection with allegations noted to date.  The Company has alerted Armenian authorities to the evidence of corruption in connection with the purported investigation and the role of Caldera and its agents.     As a part of operating in the country, the Company regularly has to deal with tax claims by authorities, none of which rise to the level of materiality. The Company also learned that Mr. Borkowski purportedly of CRA met with Armenian tax officials in attempt to gain leverage for his claims against the Company, with no tax consequence to the Company as well as exoneration for the false claims.  

34

General   
     
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business or which constitute nuisance claims. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the Company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The Company has been brought to court by several disgruntled former employees and contractors for unpaid salaries and invoices, respectively, as well as some penalties for nonpayment which totals approximately $280,000.  Some employees and creditors have petitioned for a bankruptcy proceeding against the Company s Mego Gold, GGM, GGH and Marjan subsidiaries in an effort to leverage higher payments. Local counsel has advised that this effort is not grounded in law, should not be upheld, and if it is upheld in Armenia there will be relief in international arbitration pursuant to the U.S. Armenia Bilateral Investment Treaty and the Company s 2008 settlement agreement with the Government of Armenia. On May 31, 2016 the Court of Appeals in Armenia dismissed and remanded the bankruptcy case filed against GGM, which will be a final judgment if not appealed to the Court of Cassation within thirty days.  The Company has recorded a liability for the actual unpaid amounts due to these individuals of approximately $158,000 as of September 30, 2016 and the Company has depleted the approximately $25,000 previously deposited at the Armenian Marshall service as security for the claims.  The Company is currently, and will continue to, vigorously defending its position in courts against these claims that are without merit.  The Company is also negotiating directly with these individuals outside of the courts in attempt to settle based on the amounts of the actual amounts due as recorded by the Company in exchange for prompt and full payment.  
         
  15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
     
  In accordance with ASC 855,  Subsequent Events,  the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of September 30, 2016 through the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.  
     
  On November 3, 2016, the Royal Court of the Island of Jersey issued a further award of cost and fees in favor of GGC for costs and fees awarded by the Jersey Court of Appeals   in the additional amount of approximately $160,000.  
     
  On November 4, 2016, the Armenian State Committee on Reserves approved additional amounts in three areas outside the Toukhmanuk central mining license area, i.e. in the exploration license area which is reproduced on the Company s website.  This approval triggers a one year period for the Company to prepare a mining plan for the previously exploration licensed areas, obtain  new mine and territory allocations, and convert exploration license area to long term mining license territory.  (Note, please refer to our  Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors  on our website and Form 10-K with regard to the SEC and other standards for the term  reserve. )  
     
  On December 1, 2016, the Viscounts Department of the Island of Jersey arrested all of the CRA shares in GGCRL in favor of the Company pursuant to a Royal Court judgement in the Company s favor.

( we,   us,   our,  or the  Company ) from time to time with the SEC contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  
     
  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. Our unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).  
     
  These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our unaudited condensed financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  When used in this discussion, the words "expect(s)", "feel(s)", "believe(s)", "will", "may", "anticipate(s)" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The provision of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 shall apply to any forward looking information in this Form 10-Q.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
   THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   
     
  During the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any revenue.  The lack of revenue is attributable to no sales of gold concentrate from the Toukhmanuk property because of operational funding delays, needing a new tailings damn, the status and funding of the Consolidated Resources joint venture, and Linne Mining s performance issues.  While Linne procured and began assembling a new processing plant at Toukhmanuk, completion has been delayed, mining in accordance with relevant agreements and approved plans has not occurred.  
     
  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company's administrative and other expenses were $996,556 which represented a decrease of $308,486 from $1,275,042 in the same period last year. The expense decrease was primarily attributable to decreased legal expenses of $146,366, compensation expense of $68,586 and stock compensation of $29,292.  
     
  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company's administrative and other expenses were $302,418 which represented a decrease of $126,980 from $429,398 in the same period last year. The expense decrease was primarily attributable to decreased legal expenses of $12,169, compensation expense of $46,488 and stock compensation of $1,791.  
     
  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any mine exploration costs which represented a decrease of $131,623 from $131,623 in the same period last year.  The expense decrease was attributable to the decreased activity at the Toukhmanuk Property of $131,623.   
     
  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any mine exploration costs which represented a decrease of $47,148 from $47,148 in the same period last year.

  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company's amortization and depreciation expenses were $80,659 which represented a decrease of $191,570 from $272,229 in the same period last year. The expense decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in amortization of $174,018 and depreciation expense of $17,552.  
          
  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company's amortization and depreciation expenses were $26,959 which represented a decrease of $30,944 from $57,903 in the same period last year. The expense decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in amortization of $24,860 and depreciation expense of $6,084.     
     
  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had interest expense of $471,598 which represented an increase of $77,487 from $394,111 in the same period last year.  The expense increase was attributable to an increase of $49,489 on mine owners debt facilities and an increase of interest expense of $19,534 on wages payable.   
     
  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had interest expense of $159,882 which represented an increase of $15,168 from $144,714 in the same period last year.  The expense increase was attributable to an increase of $573 on mine owners debt facilities and an increase of interest expense of $6,131 on wages payable.  
     
  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,518,813 which represented a decrease of $554,192 from $2,073,005 in the same period last year. The decrease was attributable to the reasons specified above.

37

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
  The Company continues to experience liquidity challenges.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 the Company's total assets were $2,553,620, of which $50,199 consisted of cash or cash equivalents. The Company s current assets were approximately $786,000, current liabilities were approximately $18,925,000, and had working capital deficit (current liabilities exceed current assets) of approximately $18,139,000. The Company did not have any long term debt as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  The Company's expected plan of operation for the calendar year 2016 is:  
     
  (a) To complete the construction of the new plant (pictures are available on the Company s website) and to implement the mining plan and to recommence operating expanded mining operations at Toukhmanuk in accordance with the approved plan (approximate cost of $3,250,000), as well as to continue to explore this property to confirm and develop historical reports (approximate cost of $2,300,000), to explore and develop the Getik property in Armenia (approximate initial cost of $1,700,000) either through Linne s performance, a new mine contractor, or the Company s re-assuming operations;  
     
  (b) To mine, develop, and explore at the Marjan property in Armenia (approximate initial cost of $5,000,000);  
     
  (c) To pursue enforcement of the International Arbitration awards and court judgments against CRA, Caldera Resources, and Conventus/Alluvia/Amarant (cost is undetermined at this time);  
     
  (d) To review and acquire additional mineral bearing properties in Chile, Armenia, and other countries (no additional costs projected unless any acquisitions are made); and  
     
  (e) Pursue additional financing through private placements, debt and/or joint ventures (no additional costs to pursue additional funding).  
     
  On July 5, 2013, the Company concluded a fifteen year operating agreement with Linne Mining, LLC ( Linne ) as the operator along with an $8,800,000 debt facilities agreement to fund future production at Toukhmanuk. On June 30, 2014, the Armenian government issued the tailings dam permit (available on the Company s website) for the Toukhmanuk property to which the Company was entitled and was a prerequisite to processing ore. Equipment for the plant upgrades has been delivered to the mine site for assembly and operation. In light of Linne Mining s request to be relieved of its responsibilities and other acts and omissions, it is not expected that the new tailings dam (approximate cost of $1,000,000), and the design and construction of a new upgraded plant (approximate cost of $3,000,000). The Company is exploring options and companies to help get the plant completed and operational.  
     
  The Company may engage in research and development related to exploration and processing during 2016 and 2017, and may purchase additional equipment and mining assets to expand production.  
     
  In light of the legal and other consequences of the CRA group and Signature Gold in applying for a competing license on Getik, the Company decided to stop working at this property pending resolution and notice has been delivered to the Armenian Government.  
     
  The Company has received a going concern opinion from its independent public accounting firm.  This means that our auditors believe that there is doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we raise additional capital to pay our bills.  This is because the Company has not generated any substantial revenues.  The Company has been able to continue based upon its receipt of funds from the issuance of equity securities and by acquiring assets or paying expenses by issuing stock, debt, or sale of assets. The Company's continued existence is dependent upon its continued ability to raise funds through the issuance of securities. Management's plans in this regard are to obtain other financing until profitable operation and positive cash flow are achieved and maintained.  
     
  Besides the funding from agreements with Linne (which are under review for non-performance), there are no firm commitments from third parties to provide additional financing, and the Company needs additional funds in order to conduct any active mining development and production operations in the foreseeable future.  The Company is in discussion to acquire additional financing, but there can be no assurance that any financing for current operations, acquisitions or future projects will be available for such purposes or that such financing, if available, would be on terms favorable or acceptable to the Company.  
     
  The Company does not currently intend to define proven or probable reserves, in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7 prior to extracting mineralized materials.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities   
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 cash used in operating activities increased by $188,419 to $487,298 compared to $298,879 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in amortization and depreciation expense of $191,570, a decrease in stock compensation expense of $29,292, a decrease is expenses incurred by mine owners debt facility of $207,127, a decrease in wages payable of $4,690, a decrease in other current and non-current assets of $17,174, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $394,539 offset by a decrease in net loss of $554,192, an increase is expenses incurred by notes payable to Directors of $5,687, and an increase in accrued interest of $96,094.

   Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities   
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 cash provided by financing activities decreased by $93,581 to $557,500 compared to $651,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from mine owners debt facilities of $291,600 offset by a decrease in repayment of secured line of credit of $128,019, and an increase in the proceeds from notes payable to Directors of $70,000.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
     
  The Company does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments nor does it have any foreign currency exchange agreements.  The Company maintains an inventory of unprocessed ore and gold concentrate which are carried on the balance sheet at $462,911 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 with our Armenian subsidiary Mego-Gold LLC.  The Company carries and values its unprocessed ore and gold concentrate inventory at the lower of cost or market. Periodically, and no less than on an annual basis, the Company compares the carrying value of its inventory to current market prices to determine if its carrying value should be adjusted. The Company is currently reporting its inventory at cost which is still less than the current market value so recent fluctuations in gold prices have no effect on our carrying value of inventory. The Company does not maintain any commodity hedges or futures arrangements with respect to this unprocessed ore.  
     
  Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States and Armenia.  Bank deposits in the United States did not exceed federally insured limits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $44,850 and $6,160, respectively, in Armenian bank deposits which may not be insured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts through September 30, 2016 and as of the date of this filing.  
     
  The majority of the Company's present activities are in Armenia. As with all types of international business operations, currency fluctuations, exchange controls, restrictions on foreign investment, changes to tax regimes, political action and political instability could impair the value of the Company's investments  
       
   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), as of June 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
  Management's internal control report over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting except raw material and work in process physical inventories are being performed at the end of each quarter.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
     
   CRA Related   
     
  All CRA initiated litigation in Jersey has been resolved in the Company s favor as of September 13, 2016, except regarding collection of fees and cost against CRA. On January 6, 2014, the Company received notice from Mr. Borkowski that the amount due to CRA in accordance with the Convertible Notes was $2,197,453 plus interest $933,942 at 15% neither of which the Company believes is valid and is only carrying the $1,500,000 in Notes plus the $394,244 of Advances payable. The January 6, 2014 notice from Mr. Borkowski acknowledges that amounts above $1,500,000 are  uncertificated.  No Company approval or adequate substantiation for crediting the difference of $1,894,244 and $2,197,453 as amount due under the Convertible Notes or as Advances has been provided. The Company and GGC have also raised fraud issues with CR which have not been resolved; if unresolved, the fraud issues would vitiate CR s rights and create liabilities. A draft audit report was prepared, but both CRA and its director Mr. Premraj each failed to attend two shareholder and board meetings to consider the draft report. The February 27, 2014 shareholder and board meetings were adjourned in accordance with the Articles and when the shareholder meeting reconvened on March 7, 2014 the Company voted its majority shares to approve the draft audit report. On March 10, 2014, Mr. Borkowski purportedly on behalf of CRA received an  Order of Justice  and injunction from the Royal Court of Jersey against GGCRL, the Executive Chairman of GGCRL and the Company enjoining it from certain activities. The order was applied for and received on an ex parte basis without giving any of the defendants notice or opportunity to be heard and based on incomplete and fraudulent representations. Neither Mr. Premraj who was consistently represented as the owner of CRA or Mr. Marvin who signed every agreement on behalf of CRA submitted a sworn statement in support of CRA or Mr. Borkowski so there are additional concerns about fraud and misrepresentation as well as counterparty risk. GGCRL matters are subject to a broad arbitration agreement, and the Company has triggered the dispute resolution provisions of the 2011 JVA as well as subsequent arbitration agreements, and the arbitration agreement has been upheld by the Jersey courts. The Jersey legal action is considered to be a bad faith tactic, not based in law or fact, and designed only to extract extra legal advantages against the Company. On April 2, 2014, the aspects of the ex parte injunction affecting operations were lifted. The Company is still considering its legal options with respect to CRA as well as the individuals who have misled the Company, frustrated the GGCRL joint venture as well as the November 2013 merger agreement with Signature, and breached the relevant agreements. The Company is also aware that Mr. Borkowski has attempted to buy the Mego Gold ABB loan from the ABB bank (since repaid in full), has materially interfered in the Company s contractual and business affairs and is cooperating with Mr. Mavridis and Caldera Resources in issuing defamatory material on the internet and elsewhere against the Company and its principals. The Company has also received registry documents showing that in 2012 Mr. Borkowski established a company with Caldera's representative to Armenia named the "Aparan Mining Company." The Company has also received additional information on Mr. Borkowski s activities relative to damaging the Company and attempting to misappropriate its assets in Armenia. The Company is engaged in litigation in Armenia concerning the Getik license and a competing claim to that license advanced by a company affiliated with Mr. Borkowski s attorney,  Mining Solutions, LLC.   
     
  In the Jersey legal action, Mr. Borkowski attempted to obtain judgment on the Convertible Notes claim for CRA, but the court denied that attempt and held the issue over in a judgment dated June 18, 2014; the court awarded the Company its costs in defending the attempt by Mr. Borkowski purportedly on behalf of CRA.  
     
  On March 26, 2015, the Court of Appeals of the Island of Jersey ruled in the Company s favor in staying all proceedings and referring the claims initiated by Joseph Borkowski, purportedly on behalf of CRA to the contracted dispute resolution procedures in New York City. On the same day, the Court of Appeals also granted the Company its costs and fees for the entire proceedings with CRA. Approximately $50,000 has already been awarded to the Company against CRA (but not paid) with further award of $230,000 based on the Court of Appeals award and additional amounts pending.  
     
  On April 22, 2015, the Victoria Legal Services Commission in Australia found that the attorney Mr. Premraj chose to represent GGCRL in the Signature Gold transaction, Charles Wantrup, who acted to the detriment of the Company, engaged in  unsatisfactory professional conduct.   
     
  On May 27, 2015, the Court of Appeals of the Island of Jersey again ruled in the Company s favor refusing CRA s request for leave to appeal to the Queen s Privy Council. CRA requested the Queen s Privy Council for leave to appeal which was granted. On July 20, 2015, in accordance with the CRA Agreements and the Jersey Court of Appeals decisions, the Company instituted a mediation process with CRA at the American Arbitration Association in New York City. In a further material breach of the CRA Agreements, CRA refused to participate in the mediation. At the same time, On November 18, 2015, the Royal Court of Jersey ruled in favor of GGCRL, the Company, and Mr. Krikorian in lifting all remnants of the injunction issued in 2014 which was not appealed, see exhibit 10.76 below. The Company has been awarded its costs and attorney fees, which it is pursuing.   

41

On September 13, 2016, the United Kingdom  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  ( JCPC ) issued an order and opinion finally dismissing the action which Joseph Borkowski filed and pursued purportedly on behalf of CRA in Island of Jersey against GGCRL, the Company, and Van Krikorian.  (JCPC # 2015/0075).  The JCPC dismissed the Borkowski/CRA action with prejudice and like the lower courts granted the Company and Mr. Krikorian their costs and legal fees.  This fully terminates the Jersey litigation in favor of the Company and Mr. Krikorian except for the calculation and collection of costs and legal fees.      
     
  The Company has reengaged in settlement discussions to resolve disputes with the beneficial owner of CRA, Caralapti (Prem) Premraj and Jeffrey Marvin, who signed all of the relevant contracts with the Company on behalf of CRA. See Subsequent Events for an update.   
       
   Amarant and Alluvia Related   
     
  On August 6, 2013, the American Arbitration Association International Centre for Dispute Resolution issued a Partial Final Award in favor of the Company for $2,512,312 as a liquidated principal debt plus 12% interest and excluding any additional damages, attorney fees, or costs which will be discussed at a later time. Additionally, the American Arbitration Association enjoined Amarant and Alluvia from assigning or alienating any assets or performing or entering transactions which would have the effect of alienating its respective assets pending payment of $2,512,312 to Global Gold. Amarant and Alluvia have not complied with the arbitral award to pay, produce records, or, apparently, enter transactions pending payment in full to Global Gold. Subsequent to the arbitral award, Amarant and Alluvia announced on the Amarant website in 2013 that  [t]he companies have reached an agreement with a UAE based consortium to sell material parts of their assets. The deal was signed on the 30th September in London and consists of three parts. The first stage consists of the sales of the shares in Mineral Invest and Alluvia that are pledged as security for various bridge financing solutions and short term financing. In a second stage the consortium will provide the operational companies MII and Alluvia with necessary funding to start the operations and settle off short term debts and obligations in Alluvia and Mineral Invest including, but not limited to, legal fees to the SOVR law firm, license fees, funds owed to Global Gold related to the purchase of the Valdevia, Chile property and remaining payments against NSR commitments in connection with the Huakan deal. The first two stages are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.  Global Gold was contacted by Mr. Ulander and separately by the former Chairman of Alluvia, Mr. Thomas Dalton, as the representative of the consortium, Gulf Resource Capital, referenced in the Amarant/Alluvia announcement to settle the arbitration award and despite the expectation of payments, no payments were made by December 31, 2013 and the parties have not reached a definitive agreement. There can be no assurance that Gulf Resource Capital will pay on behalf of Amarant and Alluvia, Global Gold will continue to seek enforcement of the arbitral award to the full extent as well as pursue its claims of additional damages in the ongoing arbitration.  
     
  On June 26, 2014, the International Center for Dispute Resolution International Arbitration Tribunal delivered a Final Award in the matter of Global Gold Corporation vs. Amarant Mining LTD and Alluvia Mining, Ltd. awarding Global Gold $16,800,000 USD plus $68,570.25 USD in interest, costs, and fess, with post-award interest on unpaid amounts accruing at 9%. In addition, the Tribunal provided the following injunctive relief:   Per my previous orders in this matter, each of Amarant and Alluvia, including its officers and agents individually (including without limitation Johan Ulander), is continued to be enjoined, directly and indirectly, from alienating any assets, from transferring or consenting to the transfer of any shares, or performing or entering any transactions which would have the effect of alienating assets pending payment to Global Gold; each of Amarant and Alluvia, including its officers and agents (including without limitation Johan Ulander) will provide within 5 business days all contracts, draft agreements, emails, records of financial transactions, financial statements, and all other documents in connection with their business affairs for purposes of determining whether Respondents have complied with the July 29, 2013 and subsequent orders, have diverted funds which could have been used to pay Global Gold, and to aid Global Gold in collection. Respondents shall specifically provide of all documents related to Gulf Resource Capital, Amarant Finance, the IGE Resources stock sale and related transactions as well as documents related to the institutions from which Respondents have represented payment would issue including but not limited to: Mangold, Swedebank, Jool Capital, Skandinavska Bank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Volksbank, Loyal Bank, Danskebank, NSBO, the  offtaker,  and Clifford Chance escrow account. Respondents shall execute any documents reasonably necessary or required by any institution to give Claimant access to this information and documents  all as more particularly set out in Exhibit 10.68.  
     
  On September 10, 2015, the Company notified Intacta Kapital AB of Stockholm of its continuing obligation to pay Global Gold on the Contender guaranty of the Amarant group.  
     
  The Company is actively pursuing worldwide enforcement of the monetary award and injunctive relief granted as well as payment on the Intacta/Contender guaranty.

Hankavan Related    
     
  In 2006, GGH, which was the license holder for the Hankavan and Marjan properties, was the subject of corrupt and improper demands and threats from the now former Minister of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Armenia, Vardan Ayvazian. The Company reported this situation to the appropriate authorities in Armenia and in the United States. Although the Minister took the position that the licenses at Hankavan and Marjan were terminated, other Armenian governmental officials assured the Company to the contrary and Armenian public records confirmed the continuing validity of the licenses. The Company received independent legal opinions that all of its licenses were valid and remained in full force and effect, continued to work at those properties, and engaged international and local counsel to pursue prosecution of the illegal and corrupt practices directed against the subsidiary, including international arbitration. On November 7, 2006, the Company initiated the thirty-day good faith negotiating period (which is a prerequisite to filing for international arbitration under the 2003 SHA, LLC Share Purchase Agreement) with the three named shareholders and one previously undisclosed principal, Mr. Ayvazian.  The Company filed for arbitration under the rules under the International Chamber of Commerce, headquartered in Paris, France ("ICC"), on December 29, 2006.  On September 25, 2008, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Mr. Ayvazian was required to appear as a respondent in the ICC arbitration.  On September 5, 2008, the ICC International Court of Arbitration ruled that Mr. Ayvazian shall be a party in accordance with the decision rendered on September 25, 2008 by the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Subsequently, in December 2011 the ICC Tribunal decided to proceed only with the three named shareholders; in March 2012, GGM filed an action in Federal District Court pursuant to that Court s decisions for damages against Ayvazian and/or to conform the ICC Tribunal to the precedents, and on July 11, 2012 the Federal Court entered judgment in favor of the Company, which was not appealed.  Based on the evidence of the damages suffered as a result of Ayvazyan s actions, the final $37,537,978.02 federal court judgment in favor of GGM is comprised of $27,152,244.50 in compensatory damages plus $10,385,734.52 of interest at 9% from 2008.  On September 6, 2012, the United States Marshal Service for the Southern District of New York filed for service a Writ of Execution to be enforced against Mr. Vardan Ayvazyan in favor of GGM.  The Writ of Execution was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York following the order and judgment of Judge J. Paul Oetken and final entry of that judgment (No. 12,1260).   The terms of the Writ of Execution and the Thirty Seven Million Five Hundred  Thirty Seven Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy Eight dollars and Two cents ($37,537,978.02) amount of the judgment in favor of GGM are more particularly described in Exhibit 10.56 below. On November 21, 2013, the Company received from its attorneys the  without prejudice  ruling of the Judge J. Paul Oetken of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which vacated the $37.5 million default judgment which the Company had obtained against former Armenian Minister of Environment Vartan Ayvazian solely on jurisdictional grounds.  The ruling is expressly  without prejudice  to Global Gold s right to re-file or continue to pursue the case.  The court did not rule on the corruption charges or damage amount caused by Ayvazian s actions, basing its findings on Ayvazian s general insufficient contacts with New York.  One of the shareholders of the Armenian party to the agreement under which the Company brought suit against Ayvazian identified him as the undisclosed principal who controlled the transaction and divided the funds paid by Global Gold. The November 21, 2013 court ruling also did not address those facts. This ruling has no effect on the Company s financial statements as this judgment was never recorded on the Company s books.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York subsequently confirmed the dismissal  without prejudice  to the Company, and the Company continues to consider its options.  
     
  Based on the US Armenia Bilateral Investment Treaty, GGM filed a request for arbitration against the Republic of Armenia for the actions of the former Minister of Environment and Natural Resources with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is a component agency of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. ("ICSID"), on January 29, 2007. On August 31, 2007, the Government of Armenia and GGM jointly issued the following statement, "[they] jointly announce that they have suspended the ICSID arbitration pending conclusion of a detailed settlement agreement. The parties have reached a confidential agreement in principle, and anticipate that the final settlement agreement will be reached within 10 days of this announcement." The Company has learned from public records that GeoProMining Ltd., through an affiliate, has become the sole shareholder of an Armenian Company, Golden Ore, LLC, which was granted a license for Hankavan. GeoProMining Ltd. is subject to the 20% obligations as successor to Sterlite Resources, Ltd.  As of February 25, 2008, GGM entered into a conditional, confidential settlement agreement with the Government of the Republic of Armenia to discontinue the ICSID arbitration proceedings, which were discontinued as of May 2, 2008. This agreement did not affect the ICC arbitration or litigation involving similar subject matter.

Marjan Related   
     
  Effective September 7, 2016, the Company through its Marjan Mining Company subsidiary and the Armenian Government through its Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources concluded amendments to the Marjan mining agreement which among other things provides that the Company: (1) has 3 years from September 1, 2016 to build the approved tailings dam and plant; (2) has 3.4 years  following the completion of the tailings dam and plant to mine 160,000 tonnes of ore from the Marjan mine, pursuant to the approved mining plan; (3) has 12 months to prepare and file for a report for recalculation of existing Marjan reserves, based on exploration results; and (4) has 12 months  following the approval by the State Committee on Natural Resources  approval (which must be issued within 12 months of the Company s recalculation) to prepare and file an updated and mining plan, all as more particularly described in Exhibit 10.78.  Any delays the government takes that shall extend the relevant terms.  This amendment also resolves the overlapping license issue caused by Caldera Resources and its Biomine subsidiary which was determined in the Company s favor by the New York ICDR arbitral award. Please see our  Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors  on our website and Form 10-K with regard to the SEC and other standards for the term  reserve.   
     
  Based on a false representation by Caldera, on June 17, 2010, Global Gold Corporation and its subsidiary, GGM, LLC (collectively  Global ) and Caldera Resources, Inc. ( Caldera ) announced TSX-V approval of their March 24, 2010 joint venture agreement to explore and bring the Marjan property into commercial production.  As previously reported, the property is held with a twenty-five year  special mining license,  effective April 22, 2008, and expiring April 22, 2033, which expanded the prior license term and substantially increased the license area.  The license required payments of annual governmental fees and the performance of work at the property as submitted and approved in the mining plan, which includes mining of 50,000 tonnes of mineralized rock per year, as well as exploration work to have additional reserves approved under Armenian Law in order to maintain the licenses in good standing.  Caldera advised Global as well as governmental authorities that it would not be complying with the work requirements which prompted 90 day termination notices from the government and the October 7, 2010 joint venture termination notice from Global, which Global had agreed to keep the termination notice confidential until October 15, 2010.    
     
  The joint venture agreement provided that Caldera would be solely responsible for license compliance and conducting the approved mining plan, and that  [i]n the event that Caldera does not, or is otherwise unable to, pursue this project and pay to Global Gold the amounts provided for hereunder, Caldera s rights to the Property and the shares of Marjan-Caldera Mining LLC shall be forfeited and replaced by a Net Smelter Royalty (the  NSR ).  Caldera did not meet the threshold to earn any NSR under the agreement, and its notice of license non-compliance as well as its failure to pay resulted in an automatic termination of its rights by operation of the agreement.  The agreement provided that Caldera would deliver 500,000 of its shares to Global,  subject to final approvals of this agreement by the TSX Venture Exchange.  Caldera advised that the TSX Venture Exchange approval was issued in June 2010 and Caldera failed to deliver the shares.  Subject to a 30 day extension if it could not raise the funds in capital markets, Caldera agreed to make a $300,000 payment to the Company on September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010; $250,000 on March 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 30, 2011, March 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, and September 30, 2012; and $500,000 on December 31, 2012.  Caldera raised sufficient funds, but did not make these payments.  
     
  The agreement was subject to approval by the TSX Venture Exchange and the Board of Directors of the respective companies.  Caldera further informed the Company that it received TSX Venture Exchange approval on the transaction, which subsequently proved to be untrue.  On October 7, 2010, the Company terminated the Marjan JV for Caldera s non-payment and non-performance as well as Caldera s illegal registrations in Armenia and other actions.  In October 2010, Caldera filed for arbitration in New York City.  In September 2010, at Caldera s invitation, the Company filed to reverse the illegal registration in Armenia.  That litigation and the New York arbitration were subsequently resolved in favor of the Company, restoring the Company s 100% ownership of Marjan.    
     
  In a final, non-appealable decision issued and effective February 8, 2012, the Armenian Court of Cassation affirmed the July 29, 2011 Armenian trial court and December 12, 2012 Court of Appeals decisions which ruled that Caldera's registration and assumption of control through unilateral charter changes of the Marjan Mine and Marjan Mining Company, LLC were illegal and that ownership rests fully with GGM.  The official versions of the Armenian Court decisions are available through  http://www.datalex.am   /  , with English translations available on the Company s website.   
     
  On March 29, 2012, in the independent New York City arbitration case Global Gold received a favorable ruling in its arbitration proceeding in New York with Caldera which is available on the Company's website, see Exhibit 10.48. The arbitrator issued a Partial Final Award which orders the Marjan Property in Armenia to revert to GGM based on the two failures to meet conditions precedent to the March 24, 2010 agreement.  First, Caldera failed and refused to deliver the 500,000 shares to Global. Second, Caldera did not submit the final joint venture agreement to the TSX-V for approval until the middle of the arbitration proceedings, instead relying on superseded versions in its regulatory submissions and submitting  Form 5Cs  to the TSX-V which were false representations of Caldera s obligations to Global.   

44

The Partial Award states  By misrepresenting its payment obligations to the TSX-V, Caldera painted a false financial picture to the TSX-V and the investing public.   In addition, the arbitrator found that had he not come to the conclusions above,  Caldera and its officers effectively breached the JV Agreement and the terms of the Limited Liability Agreement  in multiple ways, including Caldera s failure to make quarterly payments to Global.   
     
  The Partial Award orders reversion of the Marjan property to Global, return of amounts paid to Global by Caldera returned as the JV Agreement did not go into effect, an Net Smelter Royalty to Caldera of 0.5% for each tranche of $1 million actually spent on the property, and further proceedings on Global s claims for damages with additional hearings currently set to begin July 11, 2012.  As previously reported, Global s records establish that Caldera did not spend $1 million on the Marjan property.  Additionally, tax returns filed by Caldera in Armenia report less than $400,000 spent on the property.  The parties' arbitration agreement further provides that the award  shall be final and non-appealable  and for the award of attorney fees, arbitrator s fees, and other costs.  In accordance with the Arbitrator's order and the JV agreement, Global Gold has filed to confirm the Partial Final Award in Federal Court.  Caldera is opposing the confirmation.  The amounts paid to Global by Caldera total $150,000 and is included in the Company s accounts payable, although they are disputed and offset by damages and other amounts due by Caldera to the Company.  
     
  In an Opinion and Order signed on April 15, 2013 and released on April 17, 2013, U.S. Federal Judge Kenneth M. Karas of the Southern District of New York confirmed the March 29, 2012 American Arbitration Association arbitration award issued by retired Justice Herman Cahn which, among other things, stated that  [t]he property should revert to [Global Gold] within thirty (30) days from the date [of the arbitration award   by April 29, 2012].  Obviously, [Global Gold] may cause the appropriate governmental bodies in Armenia to register the property in [Global Gold s] name.  All as further described in the exhibit 10.61 below.  
     
  The Company has reestablished control of Marjan Mining Company which is the license holder of the Marjan property.  A new mining license, valid until April 22, 2033, has been issued to the Company.  The Company's control has not been established over certain property, records, financial and tax information, or other assets maintained by Caldera such as warehouse and drill core as Caldera has failed to turn over such property despite being ordered to do so.  The Company is proceeding with plans to mine in compliance with the mining license, and implement additional exploration to the best of its ability.  The Company is also taking legal action to protect its rights in an adjacent territory indentified as  Marjan West  for which Caldera has publicly claimed to have a license but according to public, on-line government records, the company holding the license is 100% owned by another person.  
     
  Caldera has also publicly claimed that it continues to have rights to the Marjan property based on the parties  December 2009 agreement, but that agreement to agree was merged into the March 2010 agreement, called for completion of payments by Caldera by the end of 2012, and included other terms which Caldera cannot meet.  Caldera s attempt to raise this issue in the arbitral proceedings following the March 29, 2012 decision in Global Gold s favor has not succeeded.  Caldera and its officers and agents have also continued a defamatory campaign of harassment and filing of false claims over the internet and elsewhere against the Company and its officials which may be pursued during the damages phase of the arbitration.   

45

On November 10, 2014, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Final Award, with retired Justice Herman Cahn as the sole arbitrator, ruled in favor of Global Gold on damages and a range of other outstanding issues to finally resolve all outstanding issues. The total damage award is $10,844,413 with interest at 9% and penalties continuing to accrue if Caldera does not comply with the equitable relief granted. Of the total damage award, $3 million is compensation and $1 million is punitive damages for the defamatory publications by Caldera's principal Vasilios Bill Mavridis against Global Gold and its principals. This Final Award terminates the arbitration proceedings which Caldera instituted against Global Gold in 2010. Global Gold prevailed in the first, liability phase of the arbitration and four prior court cases, as summarized and reported in April 2013. A full copy of the 42 page Final Award as well as the other rulings is available at the Global Gold website: www.globalgoldcorp.com. Previous rulings in this matter included that Montreal based Caldera Resources, led by the brothers John Mavridis and Bill Mavridis, failed to make agreed payments to Global Gold despite having raised almost $5 million, failed to issue stock due, misrepresented the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange of the parties' contract, and otherwise breached the joint venture agreement. Caldera through its Biomine, LLC subsidiary also acquired a "Marjan West" license area which it claimed was adjacent to Marjan but in fact overlapped with Marjan. Armenian Courts at three levels found that Caldera had deceptively and illegally registered full control over the Marjan Mining Company to itself without the signatures or authorization of Global Gold, and a U.S. Federal Court confirmed the phase 1 arbitration findings while rejecting Caldera's  arguments to vacate the award. The November 10, 2014 Final Award resolved all other outstanding issues with the following specific findings and rulings requiring Caldera to:  

1.   
 
  turn over to Global Gold at its offices in Rye, New York all books, records, contracts, communications, and property related in any way to the Marjan property in Armenia and the Marjan Mining Company, including specifically the Armenian Marjan Mining Company seal, and shall pay Global Gold $50,000 plus $250 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such materials are not delivered;     

2.   
 
  turn over to Global Gold at its offices in Rye, New York communications Caldera and/or Mr. Mavridis has had with third parties concerning Global Gold its officers, agents, directors and business Without limitation, the following shall also be turned over to Global Gold: all direct and indirect (for example through a translator or agent) communications with the following individuals and organizations: Azat Vartanian, Petros Vartanian,  , Joseph Borkowski, Jeffrey Marvin,  Prem Premraj , Rasia FZE, Johan Ulander, Ecolur,  Tom Prutzman,  , Stockhouse, Investor's Hub, shareholders of Global Gold, and any governmental or regulatory authorities-- Caldera shall pay Global Gold $100 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such materials are not delivered;     

3.   
 
  issue a press release correcting the April 30, 2013 Caldera release  stating that the original release is retracted with all property books and records (including all exploration data) related to the Marjan property transferred to Global Gold and that neither Caldera nor its successors retain rights to the Marjan mine in Armenia and shall pay Global Gold $50,000 plus $100 per day for every day following issuance of this Final Award that such correcting release is not issued;     

4.   
 
  Caldera did not spend the minimum $1 million threshold necessary to be eligible for an NSR Royalty interest and therefore Caldera has no NSR Royalty or any other interest in the Marjan property;     

5.   
 
  the $150,000 which Caldera paid to Global Gold was not pursuant to the JV Agreement (which did not become effective) but pursuant to the December 2009 Agreement therefore Global Gold is not obligated to make any payments to Caldera;     

8.   
 
  pay Global Gold $577,174 for legacy governmental liabilities concerning the Marjan property and shall indemnify and hold Global Gold harmless (including attorney fees) from any governmental claims or liabilities associated with the time they control the seal of the Marjan Mining Company;     

9.   
 
  pay Global Gold $967,345 for violating Paragraph (1) of the Final Partial Award requiring turnover of property and [for] interference in Global Gold's development of Marjan and shall relinquish the portions of the Marjan West license which overlap or in any way impinge on Marjan;     

46

10.   
 
  Caldera is liable for defamation and tortious interference with contractual and business relations with regard to Global Gold and its related personnel and so shall (i) pay Global Gold $3 million in compensatory damages , (ii) pay Global Gold $1 million in punitive or exemplary damages , (iii) remove all the materials and websites controlled in any way by them which were admitted as exhibits on defamatory publications in this case from the internet and other locations, (iv) remove and be permanently enjoined from using Global Gold's trading symbol without permission; (v) not share those materials with others or arrange to have them posted anonymously or otherwise- (vi) independently,   Global Gold and those who have been named by Caldera and Bill Mavridis in the admitted exhibits on defamatory publications as well as their attorneys [are granted] the authority to contact internet service providers, search engine firms, social media sites, stock discussion boards (including but not limited to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Stockhouse, Investor's Hub and Bing) to use this Final Award to remove the material as defamatory;     

11.   
 
  for the breaches of the Confidentiality Stipulations and Orders in this case,  all publications of "confidential" or attorney eyes only material [shall] be removed from the internet and any other locations and that their substance not be republished and  Global Gold and its attorneys [are granted] the authority to contact internet service providers, search engine firms, social media sites, stock discussions board (including but not limited to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Stockhouse, Investor's Hub and Bing) to use this Final Award to remove the material-- Caldera shall pay Global Gold for $100 per day every day that persons associated with Caldera remain in violation of the Confidentiality Stipulation and Order following the issuance of this Final Award including for each day until full disclosure of all emails and other communications with third parties that the information was shared with or discussed;     

13.   
 
  reimburse Global Gold $88,269 paid to the arbitration association and for the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator.     
     
  The Final Award was certified for purposes of Article I of the United Nations New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and for purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act. The Company is actively pursuing enforcement of the monetary damages and injunctive relief granted. Caldera and its former President Mavridis have not complied with the Final Award and in conjunction with Joseph Borkowski have continued to act in contravention to the Final Award including with respect to spreading defamatory information, which the Company needs to address. The Biomine license for  Marjan West  was reportedly relinquished as of December 31, 2015.  
     
   Armenian Tax Authority Related   
     
  On January 12, 2012, the Armenian Court of Cassation confirmed prior trial and appellate court rulings rejecting a proposed tax assessment against the Company s Mego-Gold subsidiary by the Armenian State Revenue Agency related to an incorrect claim concerning gold production at Toukhmanuk as well as incorrect applications of relevant law.  Subsequently, the State Revenue agency has continued investigations and intimated that it is investigating and may make further claims against the Company based on the same matters previously adjudicated in the Company s favor as well as based on claims initiated and related to Caldera Resources and its agents during and after legal proceedings in which the Company prevailed against Caldera.   Independent legal counsel has been engaged on these matters, and the Company considers that it has no liabilities in connection with allegations noted to date and in January 2015, the State Revenue concluded its investigation with no tax or other consequence to the Company as well as exoneration for the false claims. The Company has alerted Armenian authorities to the evidence of corruption in connection with the purported investigation and the role of Caldera and its agents.      
     
  As a part of operating in the country, the Company regularly has to deal with tax claims by authorities, none of which rise to the level of materiality.  
     
  The Company also learned that Mr. Borkowski purportedly of CRA met with Armenian tax officials in the fall of 2012 and worked with Caldera  
  Resources and its President Bill Mavridis to give defamatory testimony and other defamatory materials in attempt to bring criminal charges against the Company and its officers in attempt to gain leverage for his claims against the Company. The Company refuted all charges and the independent investigation confirmed that contractors were paid as reported and agreed with no tax consequence to the Company as well as exoneration for the false claims concluded in January 2015.

General   
     
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business or which constitute nuisance claims. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the Company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The Company has been brought to court by several disgruntled former employees and contractors for unpaid salaries and invoices, respectively, as well as some penalties for nonpayment which totals approximately $280,000.  Some employees and creditors have petitioned for a bankruptcy proceeding against the Company s Mego Gold, GGM, GGH and Marjan subsidiaries in an effort to leverage higher payments. Local counsel has advised that this effort is not grounded in law, should not be upheld, and if it is upheld in Armenia there will be relief in international arbitration pursuant to the U.S. Armenia Bilateral Investment Treaty and the Company s 2008 settlement agreement with the Government of Armenia. On May 31, 2016 the Court of Appeals in Armenia dismissed and remanded the bankruptcy case filed against GGM, which will be a final judgement if not appealed to the Court of Cassation within thirty days. The Company has recorded a liability for the actual unpaid amounts due to these individuals of approximately $158,000 as of September 30, 2016 and the Company has depleted the approximately $25,000 previously deposited at the Armenian Marshall service as security for the claims.  The Company is currently, and will continue to, vigorously defending its position in courts against these claims that are without merit.  The Company is also negotiating directly with these individuals outside of the courts in attempt to settle based on the amounts of the actual amounts due as recorded by the Company in exchange for prompt and full payment.
