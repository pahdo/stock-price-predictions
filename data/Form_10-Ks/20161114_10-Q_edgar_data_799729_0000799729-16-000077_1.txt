PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
   
  NOTE 1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of PAREXEL International Corporation ( PAREXEL,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information in the United States and the instructions of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (primarily consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been included. Operating results for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other quarters or the entire fiscal year. For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (the  2016 10-K ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2016. 
  In the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we recorded   $5.7 million   of adjustments related to revenue arrangements recognized in prior periods. The adjustments were recorded as reductions to service revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2016. We concluded the effect of these errors was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the current period, or any of the prior periods and, as such, these consolidated financial statements are not materially misstated. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. As originally issued, ASU 2014-09 will be effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of this standard by one year. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016. We are assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  Subsequent to issuing ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued the following amendments concerning clarification of ASU 2014-09.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 ( ASU 2016-08 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The new guidance requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, ( ASU 2016-10 )   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 ( ASU 2016-12 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition. We are currently evaluating the impact these ASUs will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 ( ASU 2016-01 ), Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10)  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    This ASU is intended to provide users of financial statements with more useful information on the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  We are assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ),   Le  ase  s (Topic 842) Section A-Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  Section B-Conforming Amendments Related to Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  Section C-Background Information and Basis for Conclusions.   This ASU requires an entity that leases assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05 ( ASU 2016-05 ),   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships(a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).   This ASU

    PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2016-05 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  In the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-12 ( ASU 2014-12 ),   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period  . ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, as it relates to such awards. ASU 2014-12 permits using either of two methods: (i) prospective to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (ii) retrospective to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter, with the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-12 as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 ( ASU 2015-16 ),   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   This ASU requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period of a business combination to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Acquirers are no longer required to revise comparative information for prior periods as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed as of the acquisition date. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 ( ASU 2015-03 ),   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . ASU 2015-03 requires the presentation of debt issue costs in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of debt issuance costs continues to be classified as interest expense. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This ASU simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The following summarizes the effects of the adoption on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements: 
    
  Income taxes     - Upon adoption of this standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards are treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. The Company also recognizes excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. As a result, the Company recognized discrete adjustments to income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, in the amount of   $2.0 million  , related to excess tax benefits. The Company has applied the modified retrospective adoption approach beginning in Fiscal Year 2017. This cumulative-effect adjustment related to tax assets that had previously arisen from tax deductions for equity compensation expenses that were greater than the compensation recognized for financial reporting. These assets had been excluded from the deferred tax assets and liabilities totals on the balance sheet as a result of certain realization requirements previously included in ASC 718. Prior periods have not been adjusted.   
    
  Forfeitures   - Prior to adoption, share-based compensation expense was recognized on a straight line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, such that expense was recognized only for share-based awards that are expected to vest. A forfeiture rate was estimated annually and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from initial estimates. Upon adoption, the Company will no longer apply a forfeiture rate and instead will account for forfeitures as they occur. As we previously estimated forfeitures to determine stock-based compensation expense, this change resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment as of July 1, 2016 to reduce retained earnings by   $0.6 million  . 
    
  Statements of Cash Flows   - The Company historically accounted for excess tax benefits on the Statement of Cash Flows as a financing activity. Upon adoption of this standard, excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity. The Company has elected to adopt this portion of the standard on a prospective basis beginning in Fiscal Year 2017. Prior periods have not been adjusted.

    PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Earnings Per Share   - The Company uses the treasury stock method to compute diluted earnings per share, unless the effect would be anti-dilutive. Under this method, the Company will no longer be required to estimate the tax rate and apply it to the dilutive share calculation for determining the dilutive earnings per share. The Company has applied this methodology beginning in Fiscal Year 2017, and prior periods have not been adjusted. 
    
  Upon adoption, no other aspects of ASU 2016-09 had a material effect on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements or related footnote disclosures. 
   
  NOTE 2.       ACQUISITIONS  
  The pro forma effects of the acquisition described below are not significant to the Company's reported results for any period presented. Accordingly, no pro forma financial statements have been presented herein. 
  We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations.   We allocate the amount that we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management and that consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, discount rates, and estimated useful lives, could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. 
  Health Advances Acquisition 
  On January 19, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of Health Advances, LLC ( Health Advances ), an independent life sciences strategy consulting firm. Health Advances combines clinical, scientific and business expertise to provide strategic advice to executives leading life sciences companies and investors. The acquisition closed on February 10, 2016, and is part of the PAREXEL Consulting Services ( PC ) segment. 
  The net purchase price for the acquisition was approximately   $67.1 million  , plus the potential to pay up to an additional   $15.8 million   over a thirty-six month period following the acquisition date if Health Advances achieves specified financial targets. We funded the acquisition with borrowings under our credit facilities.  
  The components of the consideration transferred in conjunction with the Health Advances acquisition and the preliminary fair value allocation of that consideration is as follows (dollars in millions):  
                     Total consideration transferred: 
      
          Cash paid, net of cash acquired 
    $ 
    67.1 
      
          Fair value of contingent consideration

          Goodwill 
    52.5 
      
                Total assets acquired

          Current liabilities 
    1.8 
      
               Total liabilities assumed 
    1.8 
      
      Net assets acquired: 
    $ 
    71.6 

The amounts above represent our preliminary fair value estimates as of   September 30, 2016   and may be subject to subsequent adjustment as we obtain additional information during the measurement period and finalize our fair value estimates. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received a working capital adjustment payment from the sellers of   $0.3 million  .  
  The goodwill of $  52.5 million   arising from the Health Advances acquisition largely reflects the potential synergies and expansion of our service offerings across products and markets complementary to our existing service offering and markets.  All of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The following are the preliminary identifiable intangible assets acquired and their respective estimated useful lives, as determined based on preliminary valuations (dollars in millions): 

ExecuPharm, Inc. 
  On October 3, 2016, we acquired all of the capital stock of privately owned ExecuPharm, Inc. ("ExecuPharm"), a leading global functional service provider, based in Pennsylvania.  ExecuPharm provides clinical monitoring or study management, along with associated operational activities such as onboarding, training, line management, performance management and policy administration.   
  We paid approximately   $135.0 million   for the capital stock of ExecuPharm,   plus the potential for us to pay an additional   $20.0 million   if specific financial targets for ExecuPharm are achieved and   $5.0 million   for management retention bonuses.   We funded the acquisition through the use of existing cash held within the United States. We will include ExecuPharm results of operations in our Clinical Research Services business segment. Due to the limited time since the acquisition date, we have not yet completed the initial accounting for this business combination.   
   
  NOTE 3.   EQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  We have authorized   5   million shares of preferred stock at   $0.01   par value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , we had   no   shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.  
  We have authorized   150.0 million   shares of common stock at   $0.01   par value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, we had   53.3 million   and   52.9 million   shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
  We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards and units. The following table outlines the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations:   

  Share Repurchase Plan  
  Fiscal Year 2017 Share Repurchase 
  On October 26, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the  2017 Program ) authorizing the repurchase of up to   $200.0 million   of our common stock to be financed with cash on hand, cash generated from operations, existing credit facilities, or new financing.

Fiscal Year 2016 Share Repurchase 
  On September 14, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the  2016 Program ) authorizing the repurchase of up to   $200.0 million   of our common stock to be financed with cash on hand, cash generated from operations, existing credit facilities, or new financing. On September 15, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the  2016 Agreement ) to purchase shares of our common stock from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( WF ), for an aggregate purchase price of   $200.0 million   pursuant to an accelerated share purchase program. Pursuant to the 2016 Agreement, in September 2015, we paid $  200.0 million   to WF and received from WF   2.3   million shares of our common stock, representing   80%   of the shares to be repurchased by us under the 2016 Agreement. The shares were repurchased at a price of   $70.35   per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on September 16, 2015. These shares were canceled and restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares. As of   September 30, 2016  , we recorded the   $200.0   million payment to WF as a decrease to equity in our consolidated balance sheet, consisting of decreases in common stock and additional paid-in capital. As additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, the remainder was applied as a reduction in retained earnings.  
  On February 10, 2016 we received   0.9 million   shares, representing the final settlement of the 2016 Agreement and the 2016 Program was completed. Pursuant to the 2016 Program, we repurchased   3.2   million shares of our common stock at an average price of   $62.92   per share from September 2015 to February 2016.   
   
  NOTE 4.   ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
  The following table reflects the activity for the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

The significant change in our translation adjustment was due primarily to the movements in Euro (EUR), Indian Rupee (INR), Taiwan Dollar (TWD), South African Rand (ZAR) and partially offset by Great British Pound (GBP) exchange rates against the United States Dollar (USD). For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the USD weakened by   1.3%  ,   1.5%  ,   3.0%   and   9.3%   as compared to the EUR, INR, TWD and ZAR between   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively; and the USD appreciated by   2.9%   against GBP during the same period. The movement in the EUR, INR, TWD and ZAR represents gains of   $2.1 million  ,   $1.5 million  ,   $1.1 million  , and   $1.0 million   respectively, out of the   $3.8 million   foreign currency translation adjustment during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The overall change in our translation adjustment was partially offset by the movement in GBP, representing a loss of   $2.8 million  .  
  The details regarding pre-tax gain (loss) on derivative instruments reclassified to net income from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented below: 

The amounts of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income are net of taxes of   $0.5 million  , and   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

NOTE 7.   SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  We have three reportable segments: Clinical Research Services ( CRS ), PAREXEL Consulting Services ( PC ), and PAREXEL Informatics ( PI ). 
             
    CRS constitutes our core business and includes all phases of clinical research from Early Phase (encompassing the early stages of clinical testing that range from first-in-man through proof-of-concept studies) to Phase II-III and Phase IV (which we call PAREXEL Access). Our services include clinical trials management and biostatistics, commercialization, data management and clinical pharmacology, as well as related medical advisory, patient recruitment, clinical supply and drug logistics, pharmacovigilance, and investigator site services. We aggregate Early Phase and PAREXEL Access with Phase II-III due to economic similarities in these operating segments. 
                
    PC provides technical expertise and advice in such areas as drug development, regulatory affairs, product pricing and reimbursement, commercialization and strategic compliance. It also provides a full spectrum of market development, product development and targeted communication services in support of product launch. Our PC consultants identify alternatives and propose solutions to address client issues associated with product development, registration and commercialization.  
                
    PI provides information technology solutions designed to help improve clients  product development and regulatory submission processes. PI offers a portfolio of products and services that includes medical imaging services, ClinPhone        RTSM, IMPACT        clinical trials management systems ( CTMS ), DataLabs        electronic data capture, web-based portals, systems integration, electronic patient-reported outcomes, and LIQUENT InSight  Regulatory Information Management ( RIM ) solutions.  
     We evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit (service revenue less direct costs), while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis. Accordingly, we do not include the impact of selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, other income (expense), and income tax expense in segment profitability. We attribute revenue to individual countries based upon the revenue earned in the respective countries; however, inter-segment transactions are not included in service revenue. Furthermore, we have a global infrastructure supporting its business segments, and therefore, assets are not identified by reportable segment. 
  Our segment results were as follows:

NOTE 8.   INCOME TAXES 
  We determine our global provision for corporate income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,    Income Taxes.    We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Further, we follow a methodology in which we identify, recognize, measure and disclose in our financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that we have taken or expect to take. The methodology is based on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances. Our quarterly effective income tax rate reflects management s estimates of our annual projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Since the statutory tax rates differ in the jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the distribution of profits and losses may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $29.3 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $18.9 million   would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of   June 30, 2016  , we had   $29.5 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $18.9 million   would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The reserves for unrecognized tax positions primarily relate to exposures for income tax matters such as changes in the jurisdiction in which income is taxable. The   $0.2 million   net decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustments.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we anticipate that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately   $0.4 million   over the next 12 months primarily as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements with tax authorities.  
  We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  ,   $3.6 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively of gross interest and penalties were included in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. For the   three   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , expenses of $  0.2 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, were recorded for interest and penalties related to tax matters. 
  We are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns for the tax years 2005 to 2015 remain open for examination by the relevant tax authority. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company has open tax years dating back to 2002. The extended open tax years for these jurisdictions resulted from tax attributes carryover including net operating losses or tax credits from those tax years. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we had effective income tax rates of   24.2%   and   30.3%  , respectively. The tax rates for these periods were lower than the expected statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of the favorable effect of statutory tax rates applicable to income earned outside the United States on the projected annual effective tax rate.  The tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016, benefited 4.4% from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as discussed in Note 1 to these condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  We are subject to on-going tax audits in various jurisdictions.  Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes.  We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $25.0 million   borrowed under the revolving credit facility and   $395.0 million   of principal borrowed under the term loan. The outstanding amount is presented net of debt issuance costs of approximately   $2.9 million  , in our consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had borrowing availability of   $325.0 million   under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we used   $100.0 million   in borrowings under this credit facility in connection with our acquisition of ExecuPharm. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement is intended to provide funds (i) for stock repurchases, (ii) for the issuance of letters of credit and (iii) for other general corporate purposes of PAREXEL and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions. 
  PAREXEL s obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain material domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and the obligations, if any, of any foreign designated borrower are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its material domestic subsidiaries. 
  Borrowings (other than swingline loans) under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest, at PAREXEL s determination, at a rate based on either (a) LIBOR plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of   2.0%  ) based on a ratio of consolidated net funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (the  Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio ) or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points (such highest rate, the  Alternate Base Rate ), plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of   1.0%  ) based on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. Swingline loans in U.S. dollars bear interest calculated at the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of   1.0%  ). Loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the 2016 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement terminates and any outstanding loans under it mature on March 11, 2021. 
  Repayment of the principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility (other than a swingline loan) is due on March 11, 2021. A swingline loan under the 2016 Credit Agreement generally must be paid ten (10) business days after the loan is made. Repayment of principal borrowed under the term loan facility is as follows, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding, plus accrued interest, being due on March 11, 2021: 
       To the extent not previously paid, all borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement must be repaid on March 11, 2021. 
  Interest due under the revolving credit facility (other than a swingline loan) and the term loan facility must be paid quarterly for borrowings with an interest rate determined with reference to the Alternate Base Rate. Interest must be paid on the last day of the interest period selected by the Company for borrowings determined with reference to LIBOR; provided that for interest periods of longer than three months, interest is required to be paid every three months. Interest under US dollar swingline loans at the alternate base rate is payable quarterly. 
  The obligations of PAREXEL under the 2016 Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the 2016 Credit Agreement, which includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency-related defaults, cross defaults to material indebtedness, defaults relating to such matters as ERISA and judgments, and a change-of-control default. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement contains negative covenants applicable to PAREXEL and its subsidiaries, including financial covenants requiring PAREXEL to comply with maximum net leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios, as well as restrictions on liens, investments, indebtedness, fundamental changes, acquisitions, dispositions of property, specified restricted payments (including cash dividends and stock repurchases that would result in the Company exceeding an agreed-to Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio), transactions with affiliates, and other restrictive covenants.

  We have letter-of-credit agreements with banks totaling approximately   $10.7 million   guaranteeing performance under various operating leases and vendor agreements. Additionally, the borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes are guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  
  We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. We are also regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by tax authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for prior tax years. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, and we intend to defend our positions through litigation if necessary, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation is inherently uncertain and could be materially different from that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse outcomes of tax audits could also result in assessments of substantial additional taxes and/or fines or penalties relating to ongoing or future audits. 
  The above table does not include asset retirement obligations due to the uncertainty of the timing of the future cash outflows related to the restoration costs associated with returning certain facilities to their original condition upon termination of our long-term lease. As of   September 30, 2016  , the obligation expected to be incurred was   $14.2 million  . 
  The above table does not include contingent consideration due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts and timing of the future cash outflows related to the potential payments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of   $5.2 million  . See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report for more information. 
  After consultation with counsel or other experts, we believe that no matters currently pending would have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in the event of an adverse outcome, either individually or in aggregate.

NOTE 11.   DERIVATIVES 
  We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. Accordingly, we have instituted interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs that are accounted for in accordance with ASC 815.   
             
    Our interest rate hedging program is a cash flow hedge program designed to minimize interest rate volatility. We swap the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount, at specified intervals.  Our interest rate contracts are designated as hedging instruments.  
                
    Our foreign currency hedging program is a cash flow hedge program designed to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate volatility due to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our intercompany transactions, direct costs, services revenues and significant external transactions. We primarily utilize forward currency exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps with maturities of no more than 12 months. These contracts are designated as hedging instruments. 
     We also enter into other economic hedges to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk and inherit rate risk related to intercompany and significant external transactions. These contracts are not designated as hedges in accordance with ASC 815. 
  The following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of our derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . All asset and liability amounts are reported in other current and non-current assets and other current and non-current liabilities.   

  Under certain circumstances, such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash payments and forecasted cash payments, the ASC 815 programs could be deemed ineffective. We record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 to other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets, net of deferred taxes, and any ineffective portion to miscellaneous income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded a gain of   $0.1 million   and a loss of   $1.0 million  , respectively, in miscellaneous income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income to reflect ineffective portions of hedges.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, are presented below:    

The unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments is net of taxes of   $0.8 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The estimated net amount of the existing losses that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is   $3.3 million  . 
  The change in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 is recorded in miscellaneous (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of income. The total gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments were a gain of   $0.1 million   and a loss of   $2.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  The unrealized gain (loss) recognized are presented below: 

NOTE 12.           FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  We apply the provisions of ASC 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 enables the reader of financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1     Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. 
     Marketable securities are held in foreign government treasury certificates that are actively traded and have original maturities over 90 days but less than one year. As of September 30, 2016, we did not hold any marketable securities.  
  Interest rate derivative instruments are measured at fair value using a market approach valuation technique. The valuation is based on an estimate of net present value of the expected cash flows using relevant mid-market observable data inputs and based on the assumption of no unusual market conditions or forced liquidation. 
  Level 2     Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: 
             
    quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets 
                
    quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
                
    observable inputs other than quoted prices that are used in the valuation of the asset or liabilities (e.g., interest rate and yield curve quotes at commonly quoted intervals) 
                
    inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
                
    Level 3     Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, our assets (liabilities) carried at fair value as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, our assets (liabilities) carried at fair value as of   June 30, 2016  :      

  Level 1 Estimates 
  Cash equivalents are measured at quoted prices in active markets. These investments are considered cash equivalents due to the short maturity (less than 90 days) of the investments. 
  Level 2 Estimates 
  Interest rate derivative instruments are measured at fair value using a market approach valuation technique. The valuation is based on an estimate of net present value of the expected cash flows using relevant mid-market observable data inputs and based on the assumption of no unusual market conditions or forced liquidation. 
  Foreign currency exchange contracts are measured at fair value using a market approach valuation technique. The inputs to this technique utilize current foreign currency exchange forward market rates published by leading third-party financial news and data providers. This is observable data that represent the rates that the financial institution uses for contracts entered into at that date; however, they are not based on actual transactions, so they are classified as Level 2.  
  Level 3 Estimates 
  Contingent consideration liabilities are re-measured to fair value each reporting period using projected financial targets, discount rates, probabilities of payment and projected payment dates. Projected contingent payment amounts are discounted back to the current period using a discounted cash flow model. Projected financial targets are based on our most recent internal operational budgets and may take into consideration alternate scenarios that could result in more or less profitability for the respective service line. Increases or decreases in projected financial targets and probabilities of payment may result in significant changes in the fair value measurements. Increases in discount rates and the time to payment may result in lower fair value measurements. Increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement.  
  We acquired ClinIntel Limited ( ClinIntel ), a provider of clinical randomization and trial supply management services, which are designed to make patient randomization and clinical supply chain solutions more efficient, in October 2014. The purchase price for the ClinIntel acquisition was approximately   $8.8 million  , plus the potential to pay up to an additional   $16.2 million   over a twenty-one month period following the acquisition date.  To achieve the maximum payment of   $16.2 million  , billings of   $13.4 million   in the 21-month period needed to be achieved. As of September 30, 2016, we have no further contingent consideration in connection with this acquisition. 
  In February 2016, we acquired Health Advances, LLC ( Health Advances ), an independent life sciences strategy consulting firm. Health Advances combines clinical, scientific and business expertise to provide strategic advice to executives leading life sciences companies and investors. The purchase price for the Health Advances acquisition was approximately   $67.1 million  , plus the potential to pay up to an additional   $15.8 million   over a   thirty-six months   period following the acquisition date if Health Advances achieves specific financial targets. The contingent consideration related to the Health Advances acquisition is measured at fair value with market conditions based on the use of a Monte-Carlo Simulation Model. Increases or decreases in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability were primarily impacted by the likelihood of achieving financial targets, but also by changes in discount periods and rates. 
  The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent consideration liability include the following significant unobservable inputs:

For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 categories. Additionally, there were no changes in the valuation techniques used to determine the fair values of our Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration of   $5.0 million   was recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of contingent consideration in the amount of   $5.2 million   remained unchanged.   
  The fair value of the debt under the Notes was estimated to be   $99.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and was determined using U.S. government treasury rates and Level 3 inputs, including a credit risk adjustment.  
  The carrying value of our current and long-term debt under the 2014 Credit Agreement approximates fair value because all of the debt bears variable-rate interest.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  For further information on our other critical accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the 2016 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  UPDATE TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS PRESS RELEASE DATED OCTOBER 26, 2016 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER END SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  On October 26, 2016, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K including the earnings press release announcing our consolidated financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q differ from those included in our earnings press release, primarily reflecting the effect of late identified adjustments to service revenue of $4.2 million, primarily relating to revenue arrangements recognized in prior periods. As a result, our consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q decreased $2.4 million to $37.8 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $40.2 million or $0.75 per diluted share, as reported on October 26, 2016. 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared With   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015  : 
  Revenue 
  Our service revenue by segment was as follows: 

ANALYSIS BY SEGMENT 
  We evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit (service revenue less direct costs), while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis. Accordingly, we do not include the impact of selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, other income (expense), and income tax expense in segment profitability. We attribute revenue to individual countries based upon the revenue earned in the respective countries; however, inter-segment transactions are not included in service revenue. Furthermore, we have a global infrastructure supporting our business segments, and therefore, assets are not identified by reportable segment. 
  Service revenue decreased by   $15.4 million  , or   3.0%  , to   $496.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $512.1 million   for the prior fiscal year.  
  
   22 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

CRS 
  On a segment basis, CRS service revenue decreased by   $33.9 million  , or   8.3%  , to   $376.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $410.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . CRS service revenue was down due to a high number of cancellations for active studies and large late phase studies reaching completion during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our early phase business due to increased business volumes. 
  PC 
  PC service revenue increased by   $15.7 million  , or   39.9%  , to   $55.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $39.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was due to new partnerships, an increase in the number of projects and an additional $9.1 million in revenue from the acquisition of Health Advances in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. 
  PI 
  PI service revenue increased by   $2.8 million  , or   4.5%  , to   $65.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $62.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in service revenue was primarily driven by increased demand in our medical imaging service line. 
  Reimbursement Revenue 
  Reimbursement revenue consists of reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of, and reimbursable by, clients. Reimbursement revenue does not yield any gross profit to us, nor does it have an impact on our net income. 
  Direct Costs 
  Our direct costs and service gross profit by segment were as follows: 

Direct costs decreased by   $15.5 million  , or   4.5%  , to   $327.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $343.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of total service revenue, direct costs decreased to   66.0%   from   67.0%   for the respective periods. The gross margin increase was mainly driven by our Margin Acceleration Program, margin expansion in the PI business and the addition of Health Advances in the PC segment, partially offset by a decrease in the CRS segment. 
  CRS 
  On a segment basis, CRS direct costs decreased by   $25.4 million  , or   8.8%  , to   $262.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $287.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease resulted primarily from decreased revenue, lower fixed and variable compensation expense and cost incurred in connection with our Margin Acceleration Program. As a percentage of CRS service revenue, CRS direct costs decreased to   69.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   70.1%   for the same period in   2015   due primarily to lower labor costs as a result of our Margin Acceleration Program.  
  PC 
  PC direct costs increased by   $10.2 million  , or   50.5%  , to   $30.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $20.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   largely due to an increase in revenue. As a percentage of PC service revenue, direct costs increased to   55.3%   from   51.4%   for the respective periods due primarily to a less favorable revenue mix. 
  
   23 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

PI 
  PI direct costs decreased slightly by   $0.3 million  , or   0.8%  , to   $35.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $35.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of PI service revenue, PI direct costs decreased to   53.8%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   56.7%   for the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher business volume, increased staff utilization due to increased project volume and lower costs due to our Margin Acceleration Program.  
  Selling, General and Administrative ("SG A") 
  SG A expense is summarized as follows: 

SG A expense decreased by   2.8%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to lower fixed and variable compensation expense, a $5.0 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration in the prior period and the effect of efficiency initiatives for our support functions. These decreases were partially offset by lower amounts of labor being capitalized on information technology infrastructure projects. As a percentage of service revenue, SG A expense was relatively flat at   18.6%   of service revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   18.5%   of service revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense is summarized as follows: 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by   4.6%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Amortization expense was relatively flat quarter over quarter.  The increase in depreciation was primarily related to an increase in capital spending. As a percentage of service revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was   5.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   4.6%   for the same period in   2015  .  
  Restructuring Charge 
  Restructuring expense is summarized as follows: 

In June 2015, we adopted the Margin Acceleration Program to restructure our operations to improve the productivity and efficiency of the Company simplify the organization, and streamline decision-making, thereby enhancing client engagement. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net   $1.3 million   restructuring benefit related to the Margin Acceleration Program, which consisted of changes in estimates on employee separation benefits and lease termination costs. From the announcement of the program through September 30, 2016, we recorded a net $46.5 million restructuring charge related to the Margin Acceleration Program, which consisted of $37.5 million of employee separation benefits and $9.0 million of lease termination related costs. The Margin Acceleration Program is companywide. The activities under the Margin Acceleration Program were substantially complete as of September 30, 2016.  
  
   24 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Income from Operations 
  Income from Operations     is summarized as follows: 

This increase in both income from operations and operating margin was due primarily to lower direct costs, which included a   $1.3 million   benefit related to the Margin Acceleration Program and lower labor costs and lower SG A. These decreases were partially offset by lower service revenue.  
  Other (Expense) Income, Net 
  Other (expense) income, net is summarized as follows: 

The   $3.6 million   decrease in net other expense was primarily due to a   $2.6 million   decrease in miscellaneous income and a   $1.0 million   increase in net interest expense. Net interest expense increased as a result of larger debt balances during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net foreign currency exchange losses were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in miscellaneous expense as compared to net foreign currency exchange gains in September 30, 2015 in miscellaneous income. 
  Taxes 
  The following table presents the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

  The tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , each benefited from a favorable distribution of taxable income among lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions and the United States.  The tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 benefited 4.4% from the adoption of ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , as further described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report.  
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Since our inception, we have financed our operations and growth with cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of equity securities, and credit facilities to fund business acquisitions and working capital. Investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures for information systems enhancements and leasehold improvements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $325.8 million  . The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is held in foreign countries because excess cash generated in the United States is primarily used to repay our debt obligations. As of   September 30, 2016   we did not hold any marketable securities. Foreign cash balances include unremitted foreign earnings, which are invested indefinitely outside of the United States.  Our cash and cash equivalents are held in deposit accounts, which provide us with immediate and unlimited access to the funds. Repatriation of funds to the United States from non-U.S. entities may be subject to taxation or certain legal restrictions. Nevertheless, most of our cash resides in countries with few or no such restrictions.

DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING 
  Our operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in the levels of billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue. These account balances as well as days sales outstanding ( DSO ) in accounts receivable, net of deferred revenue, can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts. We calculate DSO by adding end-of-period balances for billed and unbilled account receivables, net of deferred revenue (short-term and long-term) and the provision for losses on receivables, then dividing the resulting amount by the sum of total revenue plus investigator fees billed for the most recent quarter, and multiplying the resulting fraction by the number of days in the quarter. The following table presents the DSO, account receivables balances, and deferred revenue as of and for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  : 

DSO for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was largely unchanged compared with the three months ended   June 30, 2016  .         
   
  CASH FLOWS 
  Sources and uses of cash flows are summarized as follows:   

  Operating Activities 
  The cash flows provided by operating activitie  s during the     three     months ended     September 30, 2016     primarily resulted from     $37.8 million     in net income and     $29.6 million     in depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expenses partially offset by a credit to deferred income taxes. The increase in our operating cash flows was driven by increased profitability due to our Margin Acceleration Program  . The changes in working capital were driven by a $21.0 million increase in billed and unbilled accounts receivable and were partially offset by a decrease of $8.8 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities and $7.0 million decrease in deferred revenue. The increases in billed and unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue were due to the timing of achievement of billing milestones compared with the delivery of units for revenue recognition purposes.  The decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease in payables due to a tax legal settlement. 
  The cash flows provided by operating activities during the     three     months ended     September 30, 2015     primarily resulted from net income of     $24.9 million  ,     $28.8 million     in depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expenses partially offset by changes in working capital. The changes in working capital were driven by a $20.9 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and a $13.4 millio  n increase in net income tax liabilities, offset by a $24.0 million decrease in accounts payable. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was due to the revaluation of the earn-out contingent consideration liability associated with a certain acquisition and the increase in net income tax liabilities was due to the timing of tax payments. The decrease in accounts payable was due to the timing of invoices.  
  Investing Activities 
  The net cash used in investing activities during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by capital expenditures of   $18.8 million  . The capital expenditures in the current year are lower than in the prior year due primarily to decreased spending on information technology infrastructure.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we had   $30.9 million   in capital expenditures. 
  Financing Activities 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received a net amount of $18.9 million under the 2016 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and   $7.4 million   in proceeds related to employee stock purchases.  
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we paid   $200.0 million   as part of the accelerated share repurchase program and borrowed $130.0 million under the 2014 Credit Agreement (as defined below).    
   
  CREDIT AGREEMENTS 
  2016 Credit Agreement 
  On March 11, 2016, PAREXEL, certain subsidiaries of PAREXEL, Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America ), as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and L/C Issuer, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated ( MLPFS ), HSBC Bank USA, National Association ( HSBC ), U.S. Bank, National Association ( US Bank ), TD Securities (USA) LLC ( TD Securities ) and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ( Wells Fargo Securities ) as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, HSBC, US Bank, TD Bank, N.A. ( TD Bank ) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo Bank ) as Joint Syndication Agents, and the other lenders party thereto entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the  2016 Credit Agreement ) providing for a five-year term loan and revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to $750.0 million (collectively, the  Loan Amount ), plus additional amounts of up to $300.0 million of loans to be made available upon request of the Company subject to specified terms and conditions. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement amends and restates the amended and restated credit agreement dated as of October 15, 2014, (the  2014 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and L/C Issuer, MLPFS, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, HSBC, and US Bank, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., HSBC and US Bank, as Joint Syndication Agents, and the other lenders party thereto. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to $350.0 million from time to time outstanding. A portion of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans of up to a sublimit of $100.0 million and for the issuance of standby letters of credit up to a sublimit of $10.0 million. 
  On the closing date of March 11, 2016, after giving effect to the amendment and restatement of the 2014 Credit Agreement and the effectiveness of the 2016 Credit Agreement, the Company was obligated under the 2016 Credit Agreement for term loans in the principal amount of $400.0 million and revolving loans in the principal amount of $65.0 million. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $25.0 million   borrowed under the revolving credit facility and   $395.0 million   of principal borrowed under the term loan.  The outstanding amount is presented net of debt issuance costs of approximately   $2.9 million   in our consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had borrowing availability of   $325.0 million   under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we used   $100.0 million   in borrowings under this credit facility in connection with our acquisition of ExecuPharm. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement is intended to provide funds (i) for stock repurchases, (ii) for the issuance of letters of credit and (iii) for other general corporate purposes of PAREXEL and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions. 
  PAREXEL s obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain material domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and the obligations, if any, of any foreign designated borrower are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its material domestic subsidiaries. 
  Borrowings (other than swingline loans) under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest, at PAREXEL s determination, at a rate based on either (a) LIBOR plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of 2.0%) based on a ratio of consolidated net funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (the  Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio ) or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points (such highest rate, the  Alternate Base Rate ), plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of 1.0%) based on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. Swingline loans in U.S. dollars bear interest calculated at the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of 1.0%). Loans outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the 2016 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement terminates and any outstanding loans under it mature on March 11, 2021. 
  
   27 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Repayment of the principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility (other than a swingline loan) is due on March 11, 2021. A swingline loan under the 2016 Credit Agreement generally must be paid ten (10) business days after the loan is made. Repayment of principal borrowed under the term loan facility is as follows, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding, plus accrued interest, being due on March 11, 2021: 
       To the extent not previously paid, all borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement must be repaid on March 11, 2021. 
  Interest due under the revolving credit facility (other than a swingline loan) and the term loan facility must be paid quarterly for borrowings with an interest rate determined with reference to the Alternate Base Rate. Interest must be paid on the last day of the interest period selected by the Company for borrowings determined with reference to LIBOR; provided that for interest periods of longer than three months, interest is required to be paid every three months. Interest under US dollar swingline loans at the alternate base rate is payable quarterly. 
  The obligations of PAREXEL under the 2016 Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the 2016 Credit Agreement, which includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, cross defaults to material indebtedness, defaults relating to such matters as ERISA and judgments, and a change of control default. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement contains negative covenants applicable to PAREXEL and its subsidiaries, including financial covenants requiring PAREXEL to comply with a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as restrictions on liens, investments, indebtedness, fundamental changes, acquisitions, dispositions of property, making specified restricted payments (including cash dividends and stock repurchases that would result in the Company exceeding an agreed to Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio), transactions with affiliates, and other restrictive covenants.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2016 Credit Agreement. 
  Under the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreement, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may pay any dividend or make any other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock except that (a) we may declare and pay dividends with respect to equity interests payable solely in additional shares of common stock, (b) our subsidiaries may declare and pay dividends and other distributions ratably with respect to their equity interests, (c) we may make payments pursuant to and in accordance with stock option plans or other benefit plans for management or employees of the Company and our subsidiaries, and (d) the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may make payments in connection with permitted repurchases of their respective capital stock. 
  In connection with the 2016 Credit Agreement, PAREXEL agreed to pay a commitment fee on the revolving loan commitment calculated as a percentage of the unused amount of the revolving loan commitment at a per annum rate of up to 0.250% (based on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio). To the extent there are letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement, PAREXEL will pay letter of credit fees plus a fronting fee and additional charges. PAREXEL agreed to pay (i) Bank of America for its own account, an arrangement fee, (ii) to each of the lenders on the closing date, an upfront fee, and (iii) to Bank of America for its own account, an annual agency fee. 
  In May 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and hedged an additional principal amount of $100.0 million under a prior credit agreement with a fixed interest rate of 0.73%. The interest rate swap agreement now hedges $100.0 million of principal under our 2016 Credit Agreement.  These interest rate hedges were deemed to be fully effective in accordance with ASC 815 and, as such, unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives are recorded as other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets.   
  On October 1, 2015, we entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement effective September 30, 2016, which now hedges an additional principal amount of $100.0 million under the 2016 Credit Agreement with a fixed interest rate 1.104%.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

2016 Term Loan Agreement 
  On February 10, 2016, PAREXEL entered into a short term unsecured term loan agreement with TD Bank, providing for a loan to the Company in the amount of $75.0 million (the  Loan ). The Loan would have matured on April 30, 2016 (the  Maturity Date ) unless earlier payment is required under the terms of the Company loan agreement with TD Bank. The Loan bore interest, at PAREXEL s determination, at a base rate plus a margin (such margin not to exceed a per annum rate of 0.750%) based on a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the prior four fiscal quarters (the  Leverage Ratio ), or at a LIBOR rate plus a margin (such margin not to exceed a per annum rate of 1.750%) based on the Leverage Ratio. The Loan could have been prepaid at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, subject to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. 
  The proceeds of the Loan were advanced to the Company on February 12, 2016 and were used to repay borrowings under the Company s 2014 Facility. 
  The obligations of PAREXEL under the Loan could have been accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan, which included customary events of default, including payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties and cross defaults to the 2014 Facility. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all outstanding amounts under the Loan were fully repaid with the proceeds from the 2016 Credit Agreement. 
  Master Financing Agreement 
  On June 12, 2015, we entered into a   three   year, interest free Master Financing Agreement for $7.1 million with General Electric Capital Corporation, ( GECC ), in conjunction with a software term license purchase.  On June 30, 2015 we received the gross proceeds of $7.1 million from GECC.  Repayment of the principal borrowed under the Master Financing Agreement is due annually on July 1st as follows:  
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.8 million   principal borrowed under the Master Financing Agreement.  
  2014 Credit Agreement 
  The 2014 Credit Agreement provided for a five-year term loan and revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to $500.0 million (collectively, the  Loan Amount ), plus additional amounts of up to $300.0 million of loans to be made available upon request of the Company subject to specified terms and conditions.  The loan facility available under the 2014 Credit Agreement consisted of a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility. The principal amount of up to $200.0 million of the Loan Amount was available through the term loan facility, and the principal amount of up to $300.0 million of the Loan Amount was available through the revolving credit facility. A portion of the revolving credit facility was available for swingline loans of up to a sublimit of $100.0 million and for the issuance of standby letters of credit of up to a sublimit of $10.0 million.  
  Our obligations under the 2014 Credit Agreement were guaranteed by certain of our material domestic subsidiaries, and the obligations, if any, of any foreign designated borrower were guaranteed by us and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries.  
  The 2014 Credit Agreement was superseded by the 2016 Credit Agreement and as of September 30, 2016 all outstanding amounts under the 2014 Credit Agreement were fully repaid.  
  Borrowings (other than swingline loans) under the 2014 Credit Agreement bore interest, at our determination, at a rate based on either (a) LIBOR plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of 1.750%) based on the Leverage Ratio or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.500%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.000% (such highest rate, the  Alternate Base Rate ), plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of 0.750%) based on the Leverage Ratio. Swingline loans in U.S. dollars bear interest calculated at the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin (not to exceed a per annum rate of 0.750%). 
  Interest due under the revolving credit facility (other than a swingline loan) and the term loan facility had to be paid quarterly for borrowings with an interest rate determined with reference to the Alternate Base Rate. Interest had to be paid on the last day of the interest period selected by the Company for borrowings determined with reference to LIBOR; provided that for interest periods of longer than three months, interest is required to be paid every three months. Interest under U.S. dollar swingline loans at the alternate base rate is payable quarterly. Under the terms of the 2014 Credit Agreement, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries could have paid any dividend or made any other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock except that (a) we and our subsidiaries could have declared and paid dividends with respect to equity interests payable solely in additional shares of common stock, (b) our subsidiaries could have declared and paid dividends and other distributions ratably with respect to their equity interests, (c) we could have made payments pursuant to and in accordance with stock option plans or other benefit plans for  
  
   29 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

management or employees of the Company and our subsidiaries, and (d) the Company and certain of its subsidiaries could have made payments in connection with permitted repurchases of their respective capital stock. 
  In connection with the 2014 Credit Agreement, we agreed to pay a commitment fee on the revolving loan commitment calculated as a percentage of the unused amount of the revolving loan commitment at a per annum rate of up to 0.300% (based on the Leverage Ratio). To the extent there are letters of credit outstanding under the 2014 Credit Agreement, we would have paid letter of credit fees plus a fronting fee and additional charges. We agreed to pay Bank of America (i) for its own account, an arrangement fee, (ii) for the account of each of the lenders, an upfront fee and (iii) for its own account, an annual agency fee. 
  In September 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which hedged $100.0 million of principal under our prior debt obligations and carried a fixed interest rate of 1.30%.  In September 2015, the interest rate swap agreement matured and the related accumulated other comprehensive income was reclassified to net income during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Note Purchase Agreement 
  On July 25, 2013, we issued   $100.0 million   principal amount of   3.11%   senior notes due July 25, 2020 (the  Notes ) for aggregate gross proceeds of   $100.0 million   in a private placement solely to accredited investors. The Notes were issued pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement entered into by us with certain institutional investors on June 25, 2013 (the  Note Purchase Agreement ). Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down   $100.0 million   of principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility of the 2013 Credit Agreement, as described below. We will pay interest on the outstanding balance of the Notes at a rate of   3.11%   per annum, payable semi-annually on January 25 and July 25 of each year until the principal on the Notes shall have become due and payable. We may, at our option, upon notice and subject to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, prepay at any time all or part of the Notes in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, plus a Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement). The Notes become due and payable on July 25, 2020, unless payment is required to be made earlier under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.  
  The Note Purchase Agreement includes operational and financial covenants, with which we are required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens and dispositions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement. 
  In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Subsidiary Guaranty, pursuant to which such subsidiaries guaranteed our obligations under the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $100.0 million   in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes. The outstanding amounts are presented net of debt issuance cost of approximately   $0.2 million   in our consolidated balance sheets.   
  Receivable Purchase Agreement    
  On February 19, 2013, we entered into a receivables purchase agreement (the  Receivable Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan ). Under the Receivable Agreement, we sell to JPMorgan or other investors on an ongoing basis certain of our trade receivables, together with ancillary rights and the proceeds thereof, which arise under contracts with a client, or its subsidiaries or affiliates. The Receivable Agreement includes customary representations and covenants on behalf of us, and may be terminated by either us or JPMorgan upon five business days advance notice. The Receivable Agreement provides a mechanism for accelerating the receipt of cash due on outstanding receivables.  We account for the transfer of our receivables with respect to which we have satisfied the applicable revenue recognition criteria in accordance with FASB ASC 860,  Transfers and Servicing.  If we have not satisfied the applicable revenue recognition criteria for the underlying sales transaction, the transfer of the receivable is accounted for as a financing activity in accordance with FASB ASC 470,  Debt.  The accounts receivable and short-term debt balances are derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets at the earlier of the factored receivable s due date or when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met for those billed services. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we transferred approximately   $0.7 million   of trade receivables. As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  ,   no   transfers were accounted for as a financing activity.  
  Additional Lines of Credit 
  We have an unsecured line of credit with JP Morgan UK in the amount of   $4.5 million   that bears interest at an annual rate ranging between   2.00%   and   4.00%  . We entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $4.5 million   available for borrowing under this line of credit. 
  We have a cash pool facility with RBS Nederland, NV in the amount of   4.0 million   Euros that bears interest at an annual rate ranging between   2.00%   and   4.00%  . We entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   4.0 million   Euros available for borrowing under this line of credit. 
  We have an unsecured uncommitted overdraft facility with ING Bank NV in the amount of 7.5 million Euros that bears interest at an annual rate ranging between 2.00% and 4.00%. We entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   7.5 million   Euros available for borrowing under this line of credit.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

DEBT, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our future minimum debt obligations related to the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes described above under  Credit Agreements  are as follows:   

We have letter-of-credit agreements with banks totaling approximately   $10.7 million   guaranteeing performance under various operating leases and vendor agreements. Additionally, the borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes are guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  
  We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. We are also regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by tax authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for prior tax years. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, and we intend to defend our positions through litigation if necessary, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation is inherently uncertain and could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse outcomes of tax audits could also result in assessments of substantial additional taxes and/or fines or penalties relating to ongoing or future audits. 
  The above table does not include asset retirement obligations due to the uncertainty of the timing of the future cash outflows related to the restoration costs associated with returning certain facilities to their original condition upon termination of our long-term leases. As of   September 30, 2016  , the obligation expected to be incurred was   $14.2 million  .   
  The above table does not include contingent consideration due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts and timing of the future cash outflows related to the potential payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of $5.2 million. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report for more information.   
  We believe, after consultation with counsel or other experts, that no matters currently pending would, in the event of an adverse outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. 
   
  FINANCING NEEDS 
  Our primary cash needs are for operating expenses (such as salaries and fringe benefits, hiring and recruiting, business development and facilities), business acquisitions, capital expenditures, and repayment of principal and interest on our borrowings.  
  Credit Agreements Term Loan and Note Purchase Agreement 
  Our requirements for cash to pay principal and interest on our borrowings will increase significantly in future periods based on amounts borrowed under our 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes.  Our primary committed external source of funds is the 2016 Credit Agreement. Our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients. If we are unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increases, our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected (see Part II, Item 1A  Risk Factors  for further detail on these risks). Absent a material adverse change in the level of our new business bookings or contract cancellations, we believe that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis. Depending upon our revenue and cash flow from operations, it is possible that we will require external funds to repay amounts outstanding under our 2016 Credit Agreement upon its maturity in 2021.  
  We expect to continue to acquire businesses that enhance our service and product offerings, expand our therapeutic expertise, and/or increase our global presence. Depending on their size, any future acquisitions may require additional external financing, and we may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities. We may be unable to secure such financing at all or on terms acceptable to us, as a result of our outstanding borrowings, including our outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement.  
  Under the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreement, interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and, depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us, may float thereafter. As a result, the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change. However, we expect to mitigate the risk of increasing market interest rates with our hedging programs described below under Part I, Item 3  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Interest Rates.  
  Share Repurchases 
  On September 14, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the  2016 Program ) authorizing the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock to be financed with cash on hand, cash generated from  
  
   31 

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

operations, existing credit facilities, or new financing.  On September 15, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the  2016 Agreement ) to purchase shares of our common stock from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( WF ), for an aggregate purchase price of $200.0 million pursuant to an accelerated share purchase program. Pursuant to the 2016 Agreement, in September 2015, we paid $200.0 million to WF and received from WF 2.3 million shares of our common stock, representing   80%   of the shares to be repurchased by us under the 2016 Agreement. The shares were repurchased at a price of $70.35 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on September 16, 2015. These shares were canceled and restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares. As of   September 30, 2016  , we recorded the $200.0 million payment to WF as a decrease to equity in our consolidated balance sheet, consisting of decreases in common stock and additional paid-in capital. As additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, the remainder was applied as a reduction in retained earnings.  
  On February 10, 2016 we received 0.9 million shares representing the final settlement of the 2016 Agreement, and the 2016 Program was completed. Pursuant to the 2016 Program, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $62.92 per share from September 2015 to February 2016. On October 26, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the  2017 Program ) authorizing the repurchase of up to   $200.0 million   of our common stock to be financed with cash on hand, cash generated from operations, existing credit facilities, or new financing. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
   
  INFLATION 
  We believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition.

  Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other relevant market rates or price changes. In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes. Our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments. 
  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we derived approximately   60.7%   and   54.8%   of our consolidated service revenue, respectively, from operations outside of the United States. In addition, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our Euro-denominated service revenue accounted for   12.6%   of our consolidated service revenue and our Yen-denominated service revenue accounted for   3.7%   of our consolidated service revenue. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our Euro-denominated service revenue accounted for   10.5%   of our consolidated service revenue. We have no significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. 
  It is our policy to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in market rates of interest. Accordingly, we have instituted foreign currency hedging programs and an interest rate swap program. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our hedging programs and interest rate swap program.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the programs with derivatives designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 were deemed effective. The notional values of the derivatives were approximately   $372.9 million  , including two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of   $200.0 million  . Under certain circumstances, such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash receipts and forecasted cash receipts, the ASC 815 programs could be deemed ineffective. In such an event, the unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives, which are currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets, would be recognized in earnings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated amount that could be recognized in earnings was a loss of approximately   $3.3 million  , net of tax. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional value of derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 was approximately   $113.7 million  .  
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of   $0.9 million   and gains of   $2.4 million  , respectively. We also have exposure to additional foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge or designated hedging programs, but that risk is difficult to quantify at any given point in time. 
  Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the amount of our long-term debt. The current portion of our long-term debt was   $18.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $16.6 million   as of   June 30, 2016  . Long-term debt was   $505.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $487.8 million   as of   June 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $200.0 million   of borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement were hedged under two interest rate swap agreements, and   $100.0 million   in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes carry a fixed interest rate of 3.11%. Based on average total debt for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase in the average interest rate of 100 basis points would reduce our pre-tax earnings and cash flows by approximately   $2.2 million   on an annual basis. On October 1, 2015, we entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement effective September 30, 2016 and hedged an additional principal amount of   $100.0 million   under the 2016 Credit Agreement with a fixed interest rate of   1.104%  .

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( the  Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control related to revenue recognition in our CRS reporting segment and approval of invoices for payment and validation of vendors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, and as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  PREVIOUSLY REPORTED MATERIAL WEAKNESS 
  As reported in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for revenue recognition in our CRS reporting segment and approval of invoices for payment and validation of vendors for a specific class of vendors within the expenditure process.  
  MANAGEMENT'S PLAN FOR REMEDIATION 
  Management is in the process of designing and implementing a remediation plan intended to address the control deficiencies which resulted in the material weaknesses described above, which are not yet remediated. The revenue recognition remediation efforts are expected to include enhancement of contract amendment reviews and project revenue analytics as well as increased revenue recognition training and communication of policies and procedures for finance and non-finance personnel. The vendor payment remediation efforts have largely been completed in September 2016 by verifying authenticity of the majority of this specific class of vendors. Additional remediation efforts underway include accounts payable analytic reviews and invoice training.  
  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  Other than the identification of the material weaknesses and remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. We believe, after consultation with counsel, that no matters currently pending would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the event of an adverse outcome. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal Year 2016 filed with the SEC on September 9, 2016, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal Year 2016. 
   
  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 there were no repurchases of our equity securities. 
   
  ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
  None.

PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
  Restricted Stock Agreement 
  Incorporated Terms and Conditions 
  The terms and conditions of the award of Restricted Shares made to the Participant, as set forth in the Notice of Grant that forms part of this agreement (the    Notice of Grant   ), are as follows: 
  1.  Issuance of Restricted Shares  . 
  (a)  The Restricted Shares are issued to the Participant, effective as of the Grant Date set forth in the Notice of Grant, in consideration of services rendered and to be rendered by the Participant to the Company. 
  (b)  The Restricted Shares will be issued by the Company in book entry form only, in the name of the Participant.  The Participant agrees that the Restricted Shares shall be subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement and the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement. 
  2.  Vesting  .   
  (a)  Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Company s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ), the Restricted Shares shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant (the    Vesting Schedule    and each vesting date in the Vesting Schedule, a    Vesting Date   ) if the Company had positive adjusted earnings in the fiscal year in which the Restricted Shares were granted (the    Earnings Performance Goal   ).  For purposes of this Section 2, adjusted earnings shall mean the Company s net income determined in accordance with U.S. non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which shall be net income as set forth in the Company s financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but taking into account (i) extraordinary items and any other unusual or non-recurring items, (ii) discontinued operations, (iii) gains or losses on the dispositions of discontinued operations, (iv) the cumulative effects of changes in tax or accounting principles, (v) the write down of any asset, (vi) charges for restructuring and rationalization programs, (vii) other non-cash charges or items, (viii) gains or losses related to financing activities, (ix) the effect of acquisitions, or (x) gains or losses as a result of foreign currency conversions or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Compensation Committee shall certify within 90 days following the completion of the fiscal year, but in all events, before the First Vesting Date, that the Earnings Performance Goal has been achieved. Except as provided in Section 2(b) hereof, if the Earnings Performance Goal is not achieved and certified in accordance with this Section 2(a), the Restricted Shares shall be forfeited immediately and automatically to the Company.   
  (b)  If the Participant (i) dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) prior to the Final Vesting Date and while the Participant is providing services to the Company or (ii) is party to another agreement with the Company (for example, an employment agreement, severance agreement or change-in-control agreement), that provides for acceleration of some or all of the Restricted Shares upon Participant s ceasing to be an Eligible Participant in connection with a change in control of the Company, then, in either case, the Restricted Shares shall vest in full (or as otherwise required by an agreement between Participant and the Company) upon the date of the Participant s death, disability or his or her ceasing to be an Eligible Participant in connection with a change in control of the Company, as the case may be. 

3.  Forfeiture of Unvested Restricted Shares Upon Cessation of Service  . 
  (a)  Absent any contrary provision in the Plan, in the event that the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant for any reason or no reason (other than as described in Section 2(b) above or as provided in 3(b) below), with or without cause, all of the Restricted Shares that are unvested as of the time of such cessation shall be forfeited immediately after such cessation and automatically to the Company, without the payment of any consideration to the Participant, effective as of such cessation. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Shares that are so forfeited.  The Participant shall be an    Eligible Participant    if he or she is an employee, director or officer of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company or any other entity the employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors of which are eligible to receive awards of restricted stock under the Plan. 
  (b)  To the extent any other agreement between Participant and the Company would require that any then-unvested Restricted Shares vest in full upon the date Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant as a result of a termination (other than due to death or Disability) unrelated to a change in control, the then-unvested Restricted Shares shall accelerate pursuant to the terms of such agreement except that if Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant prior to the certification by the Compensation Committee that the Earnings Performance Goal has been achieved, the Restricted Shares shall remain outstanding and the number of Restricted Shares that would otherwise have vested pursuant to the terms of such agreement shall vest on the date on which the achievement of the Earnings Performance Goal is actually certified by the Compensation Committee.  If the Compensation Committee determines that the Earnings Performance Goal has not been achieved, the Restricted Shares shall be forfeited immediately and automatically to the Company, without the payment of any consideration to the Participant. 
  4.  Restrictions on Transfer  . 
  Except as set forth in the Plan, the Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively    transfer   ) any Restricted Shares, or any interest therein, until such Restricted Shares have vested.  The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Restricted Shares which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Plan or (ii) to treat as owner of such Restricted Shares or to pay dividends to any transferee to whom such Restricted Shares have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Plan. 
  5.  Restrictive Legends  .   
     The book entry account reflecting the issuance of the Restricted Shares in the name of the Participant shall bear a legend or other notation upon substantially the following terms:  
   These shares of stock are subject to forfeiture provisions and restrictions on transfer set forth in a certain Restricted Stock Agreement between the corporation and the registered owner of these shares (or his or her predecessor in interest), and such Agreement is available for inspection without charge at the office of the Secretary of the corporation.   
  6.  Rights as a Shareholder  . 
  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, for so long as the Participant is the registered owner of the Restricted Shares, the Participant shall have all rights as a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, whether vested or unvested, including, without limitation, rights to vote the Restricted Shares and act in respect of the Restricted Shares at any meeting of shareholders; provided that, as provided in the Plan, the payment of dividends on unvested Restricted Shares shall be deferred until the vesting of such shares. 

7.  Provisions of the Plan  . 
  This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Participant with this Agreement.   
  8.  Tax Matters  .    
  (a)  The Participant acknowledges that he or she is responsible for obtaining the advice of the Participant s own tax advisors with respect to the acquisition of the Restricted Shares and the Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents with respect to the tax consequences relating to the Restricted Shares.  The Participant understands that the Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant s tax liability that may arise in connection with the acquisition, vesting and/or disposition of the Restricted Shares.  The Participant agrees that if under applicable law the Participant will owe taxes at such vesting date on the portion of the Restricted Shares then vested, the Company shall be entitled to immediate payment from the Participant of the amount of any tax required to be withheld by the Company.  The Company shall not remove the restrictive legend described in Section 5 hereof from any shares of Company common stock until it is satisfied that all required withholdings have been made.  In addition, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance or vesting of the Restricted Shares. 
  (b)  The Participant hereby authorizes the Company to reduce the number     of     Restricted Shares that become free from restrictions on transferability and forfeiture on the applicable Vesting Date by the number     of     Restricted Shares (based on the fair market value of shares of Company common stock, $.01 par value per share ( Common Stock ), at such time) as is sufficient to satisfy the Company s minimum statutory withholding requirements with respect to the income recognized by the Participant upon the vesting of such Restricted Shares  (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for all tax purposes, including payroll and social security taxes, that are applicable to such income).  Such Restricted Shares shall be returned to the Company.  For purposes of this Section 8(b),  fair market value  shall mean the closing price per share of Common Stock on the NASDAQ stock market on the last trading day prior to the applicable Vesting Date.  Participant s acknowledgement and acceptance of these tax withholding provisions are conditions precedent to the right of Participant to receive the Restricted Shares under the Plan and this Agreement.   
  (c)  In lieu of a reduction of Restricted Shares to satisfy the Company s withholding obligation as described in Section 8(b) hereof, Participant may either (i) pay to the Company the amount of tax required to be withheld in cash, by check or in another form satisfactory to the Company  ( Cash Payment ) or (ii) at such time as the Participant is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock, and the Participant is not subject to any restrictions on trading activities on the Common Stock imposed by the Company, the Participant may execute the instructions set forth in   Annex A   attached hereto (the    Automatic Sale Instructions   ) as the means of satisfying such tax obligation.  Any election to make a Cash Payment must be communicated to the Company no later than seven days prior to the date the restrictions lapse, and any Cash Payment must be made by the date on which the restrictions lapse or such later date as is established by the Company (not to exceed 15 days after the date on which the restrictions lapse).  Any Automatic Sale Instructions must be made not later than one month prior to a Vesting Date, and in the event the Participant subsequently cancels any Automatic Sale Instructions, he or she may not enter into any further Automatic Sale Instructions with regard to the Restricted Shares. 

9.  Execution of Restrictive Covenant Agreement  . 
  If the Participant was requested by the Company to execute an agreement regarding confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, assignments of inventions and intellectual property rights, and, if applicable, non-competition (the  Restrictive Covenant Agreement ) in connection with the above referenced award, Participant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration for such award, he/she has delivered to the Company an executed copy of such Restricted Covenant Agreement.  The Participant acknowledges that he/she would not be entitled to receive the award referenced herein but for the Participant s execution of such Restrictive Covenant Agreement prior to signing this Agreement. 
  10.  Miscellaneous  . 
  (a)  No Right to Continued Service  . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that the vesting of the Restricted Shares is contingent upon his or her continued service to the Company, this Agreement does not constitute an express or implied promise of a continued service relationship or confer upon the Participant any rights with respect to a continued service relationship with the Company. 
  (b)  Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws provisions. 
  (c)  Participant s Acknowledgments  .  The Participant acknowledges (i) that he or she has read this Agreement, has received and read the Plan, and understands the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan,  (ii) that he or she agrees that in accepting this award, he or she will be bound by any clawback policy that the Company may adopt in the future and (iii) the provisions of this Agreement, including the vesting and performance requirements herein, amend and/or supersede, as the case may be, any other agreement between Participant and the Company regarding this award. 
  Annex A 
    
  Automatic Sale Instructions 
    
  The undersigned hereby consents and agrees that any taxes due on a vesting date as a result of the vesting of Restricted Shares on such date shall be paid through an automatic sale of shares as follows: 
    
  (a)    Upon any vesting of any Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the Company shall sell, or arrange for the sale of, such number of the Restricted Shares no longer subject to the transferability restrictions and forfeiture provisions under Sections 2, 3 and 4 as is sufficient to generate net proceeds sufficient to satisfy the Company s minimum statutory withholding obligations with respect to the income recognized by the Participant upon the lapse of the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for all tax purposes, including payroll and social security taxes, that are applicable to such income), and the Company shall retain such net proceeds in satisfaction of such tax withholding obligations. 
  (b)    The Participant hereby appoints the Chief Financial Officer of the Company his attorney in fact to sell the Participant s shares in accordance with this   Annex A  .  The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this   Annex A  . 

(c)    The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he or she is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or Common Stock.  The Participant and the Company have structured this Agreement, including this   Annex A,   to qualify for the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act. 
  The Company shall not remove the restrictive legend described in Section 5 hereof from any shares of Common Stock until it is satisfied that all required withholdings have been made. 
    
  These instructions apply to the Restricted Shares that vest on (check all that apply):

In consideration of services rendered and to be rendered to the Company, by the Participant, the Company has granted to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this    Agreement   ) and in the Company s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ), an award with respect to the number of restricted shares units (the    RSUs   ) set forth in the Notice of Grant that forms part of this Agreement (the    Notice of Grant   ). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the    Common Stock   ) upon vesting of the RSU, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein 
  2.  Vesting and Forfeiture  .  
  (a)  The RSUs shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant (the    Vesting Schedule    and each vesting date in the Vesting Schedule, a    Vesting Date   ) if the Company had positive adjusted earnings in the fiscal year in which the RSUs were granted (the    Earnings Performance Goal   ). For purposes of this Section 2, adjusted earnings shall mean the Company s net income determined in accordance with U.S. non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which shall be net income as set forth in the Company s financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but taking into account (i) extraordinary items and any other unusual or non-recurring items, (ii) discontinued operations, (iii) gains or losses on the dispositions of discontinued operations, (iv) the cumulative effects of changes in tax or accounting principles, (v) the write down of any asset, (vi) charges for restructuring and rationalization programs, (vii) other non-cash charges or items, (viii) gains or losses related to financing activities, (ix) the effect of acquisitions, or (x) gains or losses as a result of foreign currency conversions or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Compensation Committee shall certify within 90 days following the completion of the fiscal year, but in all events, before the First Vesting Date, that the Earnings Performance Goal has been achieved. Except as provided in Section 2(c) hereof, if the Earnings Performance Goal is not achieved and certified in accordance with this Section 2(a), the RSUs will immediately and automatically terminate as of the First Vesting Date.  
  (b)  Absent any contrary provision in the Plan, if the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant for any reason or no reason (other than as described in Section 2(c) below or as provided in Section 2(d) below), the Participant will immediately and automatically forfeit all rights to any of the Participant s RSUs that have a Vesting Date after the date Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant. The Participant shall be an    Eligible Participant    if he or she is an employee, director or officer of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company or any other entity the employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors of which are eligible to receive awards of RSUs under the Plan. 
  (c)  The Vesting Date for all unvested RSUs will be accelerated, if applicable, to the earliest of:  
  (i)  The Participant s death;  
  (ii)  The Participant s    Disability    (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(g)(4) or any successor regulation); and 
  (iii)  To the extent provided in any other agreement between Participant and the Company (for example, employment agreements, severance agreements, or change in control agreements), upon Participant s ceasing to be an Eligible Participant in connection with a change in control of the Company.  

For the avoidance of doubt, if Participant ceases to be employed for any reason or no reason (other than as described in paragraphs (i) through (iii) above or (d) below) prior to any Vesting Date, Participant will immediately and automatically forfeit all rights to any of Participant s then-unvested RSUs. 
  (d)  To the extent any other agreement between Participant and the Company would require that the Vesting Date for any then-unvested RSUs be accelerated to the date upon which Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant as a result of a termination (other than due to death or Disability) unrelated to a change in control, the then-unvested RSUs shall accelerate pursuant to the terms of such agreement except that if Participant s ceasing to be an Eligible Participant occurs prior to the certification by the Compensation Committee that the Earnings Performance Goal has been achieved, Participant s RSUs shall remain outstanding and the Vesting Date for any then-unvested RSUs which would otherwise have been accelerated pursuant to the terms of such agreement shall be accelerated to the date on which the achievement of the Earnings Performance Goal is actually certified by the Compensation Committee. If the Compensation Committee determines that the Earnings Performance Goal has not been achieved, the Participant shall immediately and automatically forfeit all rights to any of Participant s then unvested-RSUs.  
  3.  Issuance of Shares  . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any Withholding Tax obligations), as soon as practicable after a Vesting Date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, for each RSU that becomes vested, one share of Common Stock (together, the    Shares   ). The Company must, in any event, issue the applicable Shares no later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which an applicable Vesting Date occurs and (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the Vesting Date. Subject to the previous sentence and the other terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the delivery date shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and solely to the extent necessary to avoid the penalty provisions under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (   Section 409A   ), if the Vesting Date occurs because of the Participant s termination of employment and if the Company determines that the Participant is a  specified employee  as defined under Section 409A, then the distribution of newly vested Shares shall be delayed until the earlier of (i) the date that is six months plus one day after the date of termination and (ii) the 10   th    day after the Participant s date of death. Until the Vesting Date, the Participant will have no rights to any Shares or any rights associated with such Shares, including without limitation dividend or voting rights.  
  4.  Acceleration; Deferral  . 
  (a)  Acceleration  . Subject to Sections 2(c) and (d), in no event may the Company deliver the Shares to the Participant earlier than an applicable Vesting Date, except as the Plan may otherwise provide; provided, however, that in no case shall the delivery of Shares be accelerated to a date earlier than the applicable Vesting Date unless such acceleration is permitted or required by Section 409A.   Deferral  . In no event may the Company or the Participant defer the delivery of the Shares beyond the date specified in Section 3 of this Agreement, unless such deferral is permitted or required by Section 409A.  
  5.  Transferability  . The RSUs and shares they represent may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) (collectively, a    transfer   ), except that this Agreement may be transferred by the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise permitted under the Plan. The Participant may only transfer the Shares that may be issued pursuant to this Agreement following a Vesting Date that covers them.  
  6.  Tax Matters  .  
  (a)  The Participant acknowledges that the Participant has reviewed with the Participant s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the actions contemplated by this Agreement. The Participant affirms that the Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. 

(b)  The Company s obligation to deliver Shares to the Participant upon or after the vesting of the RSUs shall be subject to the Participant s satisfaction of all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax related withholding requirements (   Withholding Taxes   ).  
  (c)  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any Withholding Taxes to be withheld with respect to the actions contemplated by this Agreement. 
  (d)  The Participant hereby authorizes the Company to reduce the number     of     Shares delivered to Participant in accordance with Section 3 hereof following the applicable Vesting Date by the number     of     Shares (based on the fair market value of shares of Common Stock at such time) as is sufficient to satisfy the Company s minimum statutory withholding requirements with respect to the income recognized by the Participant upon the vesting of such Shares (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for all tax purposes, including payroll and social security taxes, that are applicable to such income).  For purposes of this Section 6(d),  fair market value  shall mean the closing price per share of Common Stock on the NASDAQ stock market on the last trading day prior to the applicable Vesting Date. Participant s acknowledgement and acceptance of these tax withholding provisions are conditions precedent to the right of Participant to receive the Shares under the Plan and this Agreement. 
  (e)  In lieu of the reduction of Shares delivered to satisfy the Company s withholding obligations as described in paragraph (d) above, Participant may either (i) pay to the Company the amount of tax required to be withheld in cash, by check or in another form satisfactory to the Company ( Cash Payment ) or (ii) at such time as the Participant is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock, and the Participant is not subject to any restrictions on trading activities on the Common Stock imposed by the Company, the Participant may execute the instructions set forth in   Annex A   attached hereto (the    Automatic Sale Instructions   ) as the means of satisfying such tax obligation.  Any election to make a Cash Payment must be communicated to the Company no later than seven days prior to the date the restrictions lapse, and any Cash Payment must be made by the Vesting Date or such later date as is established by the Company (not to exceed 15 days after the Vesting Date on which the restrictions lapse). Any Automatic Sale Instructions must be made not later than one month prior to a Vesting Date, and in the event the Participant subsequently cancels any Automatic Sale Instructions, he or she may not enter into any further Automatic Sale Instructions with regard to the Shares. 
  7.  Securities Laws  . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, the Company will not be required to issue, and the Participant may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock received as payment of the RSUs, unless (a) there is in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock received as payment of the RSUs a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state or foreign securities laws or an exemption from such registration, and (b) there has been obtained any other consent, approval or permit from any other regulatory body that the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Company s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. The Company may condition such issuance, sale or transfer upon the receipt of any representations or agreements from the parties involved, and the placement of any legends on certificates representing Common Stock received as payment of the RSUs, as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the Company to comply with such securities law or other restrictions.  
  8.  Provisions of the Plan  . This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Participant with this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. 

9.  Execution of Restrictive Covenant Agreement  . If the Participant was requested by the Company to execute an agreement regarding confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, assignments of inventions and intellectual property rights, and, if applicable, non-competition (the  Restrictive Covenant Agreement ) in connection with the above referenced award, Participant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration for such award, he/she has delivered to the Company an executed copy of such Restricted Covenant Agreement. The Participant acknowledges that he/she would not be entitled to receive the award referenced herein but for the Participant s execution of such Restrictive Covenant Agreement prior to signing this Agreement. 
  10.  Miscellaneous  .  
  (a)  Section 409A  . This Agreement is intended to be exempt from or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and shall be construed consistently therewith. In any event, the Company makes no representations or warranty and will have no liability to the Participant or any other person, other than with respect to payments made by the Company in violation of the provisions of this Agreement, if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.  
  (b)  Unsecured Creditor  . This Agreement shall create a contractual obligation on the part of Company to make payment of the RSUs credited to the Participant s account at the time provided for in this Agreement. Neither the Participant nor any other party claiming an interest in the RSUs or related stock hereunder shall have any interest whatsoever in any specific assets of the Company. The Participant s right to receive payments hereunder shall be that of an unsecured general creditor of Company. 
  (c)  Severability  . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.  
  (d)  Waiver  . Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board of Directors of the Company or the Committee.  
  (e)  Binding Effect  . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and its and the Participant s respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement.  
  (f)  Notice  . All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery or five calendar days after deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party hereto at, for the Company, its primary business address (attention Director of Human Resources) and, for the Participant, at the Participant s home address as reflected in the records of the Company, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 10(f).  
  (g)  Entire Agreement  . This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, including the vesting and performance requirements herein, amend and/or supersede, as the case may be, any other agreement between Participant and the Company regarding this Award. 
  (h)  Governing Law  . This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws.  
  (i)  Electronic Delivery  . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to participation in the Plan or awards granted under the Plan by electronic means or to request the Participant s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means.  

The Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.  
  (j)  Acknowledgments  . The Participant acknowledges that the Participant: (i) has read this Agreement; (ii) has been represented in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement by legal counsel of the Participant s own choice or has voluntarily declined to seek such counsel; (iii) understands the terms and consequences of this Agreement; (iv) is fully aware of the legal and binding effect of this Agreement; (v) understands that the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the actions contemplated by this Agreement, and is not acting as counsel for the Participant; and (vi) in accepting this award, agrees to be bound by any clawback policy that the Company may adopt in the future.

  (a)    Upon any vesting of RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the Company shall sell, or arrange for the sale of, such number of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to the RSUs that vest pursuant to Section 2 as is sufficient to generate net proceeds sufficient to satisfy the Company s minimum statutory withholding obligations with respect to the income recognized by the Participant upon the vesting of the RSUs (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for all tax purposes, including payroll and social security taxes, that are applicable to such income), and the Company shall retain such net proceeds in satisfaction of such tax withholding obligations.

PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  
    
  Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement  
  Incorporated Terms and Conditions 
    
  1.      Grant of Option  .  
    
  This agreement evidences the grant by the Company, on the grant date     (the    Grant Date   ) set forth in the Notice of Grant that forms part of this agreement (the    Notice of Grant   ), to the Participant of an option to purchase, in whole or in part, on the terms provided herein and in the Company s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ), the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant of common stock, $0.01     par value per share, of the Company (   Common Stock   ), at the exercise price     per Share set forth in the Notice of Grant. Unless earlier terminated, this option shall expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the Final Exercise Date set forth in the Notice of Grant     (the    Final Exercise Date   ). 
    
  It is intended that the option evidenced by this Agreement shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the  Code ). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term  Participant , as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms.  
    
  2.      Vesting of Option if Business Relationship Continues  . 
    
  If the Participant has continued to serve the Company in the capacity of an employee, officer, director, consultant or advisor (such service is described herein as maintaining or being involved in a  Business Relationship  with the Company) on the dates set forth in the vesting schedule (the  Vesting Schedule ) in the Notice of Grant, subject to Section 3, the Participant may exercise this option for the number of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Vesting Schedule. 
    
  The foregoing rights are cumulative and, while the Participant continues to maintain a Business Relationship with the Company may be exercised on or before the Final Exercise Date. All of the foregoing rights are subject to Section 3, as appropriate, if the Participant ceases to maintain a Business Relationship with the Company or retires, dies, becomes disabled or undergoes dissolution while involved in a Business Relationship with the Company. 
    
  3.       Exercise of Option 
    
  (a)  Form of Exercise  .  Each election to exercise this option shall be in writing, signed by the Participant, and received by the Company at its principal office, accompanied by this Agreement, and payment in full in the manner provided in the Plan, including pursuant to Section 5(f)(3) of the Plan. Such election shall state the number of Shares for which it is being exercised and the amount of the purchase price for such Shares. The Participant may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share.  For purposes of this Section 3(a), in the event payment is made pursuant to Section 5(f)(3) of the Plan,  fair market value  shall mean the closing price per share of Common Stock on the NASDAQ stock market on the last trading day prior to the applicable exercise date.   

(b)  Continuous Relationship with the Company Required  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Participant, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has at all times since the Grant Date maintained or been involved in a Business Relationship with the Company (an  Eligible Participant ). For purposes of this Section 3, employment of any Participant shall be considered as continuing uninterrupted during any bona fide leave of absence (such as those attributable to illness, military obligations or governmental service) provided that the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days or, if longer, any period during which such Participant s right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute. A bona fide leave of absence with the written approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, or a Committee of such Board, if applicable, shall not be considered an interruption of employment under this Section 3, provided that such written approval contractually obligates the Company to continue the employment of the Participant after the approved period of absence. Options granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of employment within or among the Company, so long as the Participant continues to maintain or be involved in a Business Relationship with the Company. 
    
  (c)  Termination of Relationship with the Company  . If the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant for any reason, then, except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) below, the right to exercise this option shall terminate sixty (60) days after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date),   provided     that   this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon such violation. 
    
  (d)  Exercise Period Upon Death or Disability  . If the Participant dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Participant and the Company has not terminated such relationship for  cause  as specified in paragraph (e) below, this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of death or disability of the Participant (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), by the Participant (or, in the case of death, by an authorized executor, personal representative or beneficiary), and any unexercisable installments of any stock options of the Company held by the Participant on the Participant s last date of employment with the Company that have not expired, shall become exercisable on such last date of employment and shall remain exercisable for the period set forth herein, provided that this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.  
    
  (e)  Discharge for Cause  . If the Participant is discharged by the Company for  cause  (as defined below), the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon the effective date of such discharge. If the Participant is subject to an individual employment or severance agreement with the Company or eligible to participate in a Company severance plan or arrangement, in any case which agreement, plan or arrangement contains a definition of  cause  for termination of employment,  Cause  shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in such agreement, plan or arrangement.  Otherwise,  Cause  shall mean willful misconduct by the Participant or willful failure by the Participant to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Participant of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Participant and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive.  

The Participant shall be considered to have been discharged for  Cause  if the Company determines, within 30 days after the Participant s resignation, that discharge for cause was warranted. 
    
  (f)  Exercise Period Upon Retirement  . If the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant by reason of his or her Retirement from the Company, this Option shall be exercisable for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of Retirement of the Participant, by the Participant,   provided     that   this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that it was exercisable by the Participant on the date of his or her Retirement and further provided that this Option shall not, in any case, be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date. For purposes of this Agreement,  Retirement  shall mean the voluntary termination by the Participant of his or her Business Relationship with the Company after completion of five (5) or more consecutive years of service with the Company   and   after reaching  normal retirement age  as such term is commonly understood in the jurisdiction of the Participant s residence.  
    
  (g)  Dissolution.   If the Participant is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity that is dissolved, is liquidated, becomes insolvent or enters into a merger or acquisition with respect to which the Participant is not the surviving entity, at a time when the Participant is involved in a Business Relationship with the Company, this option shall immediately terminate as of the date of such event, and the only rights hereunder shall be those as to which this option was properly exercised before such dissolution or other event. 
    
  4.    Withholding  .  
    
  No Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of this option unless and until the Participant pays to the Company, or makes provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of, any federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of this option.  
    
  5.   Nontransferability of Option; Clawback  .  
    
  (a)  This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during the lifetime of the Participant, this option shall be exercisable only by the Participant. 
    
  (b)  In accepting this option, the Participant agrees to be bound by any clawback policy that the Company may adopt in the future. 
    
  6.   Execution of Restrictive Covenant Agreement  .  If the Participant was requested by the Company to execute an agreement regarding confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, assignments of inventions and intellectual property rights, and, if applicable, non-competition (the  Restrictive Covenant Agreement ) in connection with the above referenced grant, Participant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration for such grant, he/she has delivered to the Company an executed copy of such Restricted Covenant Agreement.  The Participant acknowledges that he/she would not be entitled to receive the grant referenced herein but for the Participant s execution of such Restrictive Covenant Agreement prior to signing this Agreement.  
    
  7.   Capital Changes and Business Successions  .  
    
  The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of options in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers.  

Provisions in the Plan for adjustment with respect to stock subject to options and related provisions with respect to successors to the business of the Company are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference. 
    
  8.   Miscellaneous  . 
    
  (a)  Notices  . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address set forth below. The addresses for such notices may be changed from time to time by written notice given in the manner provided for herein.  
    
  (b)  Entire Agreement; Modification  .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all proposals, written or oral, and all other communications between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may be modified, amended or rescinded only by a written agreement executed by both parties.  
    
  (c)  Severability  . The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision. 
    
  (d)  No Guarantee of Employment  .  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to provide the Participant with any guarantee of employment with the Company for any defined period of time or any continued employment with the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall alter or modify the employment status of the Participant.

  Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreement 
  Incorporated Terms and Conditions 
  For valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the Company and the Participant agree as follows:  
  1.   Grant of PRSUs  . 
    
  In consideration of services rendered and to be rendered to the Company, by the Participant, the Company has granted to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Peformance Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this    Agreement   ) and in the Company s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ), an award with respect to the number of performance restricted shares units (the    PRSUs   ) set forth in the Notice of Grant that forms part of this Agreement (the    Notice of Grant   ).  Each PRSU represents the right to receive one or more shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the    Common Stock   ) upon vesting of the PRSU, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  The number of PRSUs set forth in the Notice of Grant is referred to as the    Target PRSUs   .   
  2.    Vesting, Forfeiture and Determination of Shares Earned  .  
    
  (a)  The PRSUs shall vest and pay out in accordance with Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein. 
    
  3.    Issuance of Shares  . 
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any Withholding Tax obligations), as soon as practicable after the Final Vesting Date (as defined in Exhibit A), the Company shall deliver to the Participant, for each PRSU that becomes vested, one share of Common Stock (together, the    Shares   ). The Company must, in any event, issue the applicable Shares no later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which an applicable Final Vesting Date occurs and (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the Final Vesting Date. Subject to the previous sentence and the other terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the delivery date shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and solely to the extent necessary to avoid the penalty provisions under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (   Section 409A   ), if the Final Vesting Date occurs because of the Participant s termination of employment and if the Company determines that the Participant is a  specified employee  as defined under Section 409A, then the distribution of newly vested Shares shall be delayed until the earlier of (i) the date that is six months plus one day after the date of termination and (ii) the 10   th    day after the Participant s date of death. Until the Final Vesting Date, the Participant will have no rights to any Shares or any rights associated with such Shares, including without limitation dividend or voting rights.  
    
  4.    Acceleration; Deferral  . 
    
  (a)  Acceleration  . In no event may the Company deliver the Shares to the Participant earlier than an applicable Final Vesting Date, except as the Plan may otherwise provide; provided, however, that in no case shall the delivery of Shares be accelerated to a date earlier than the Final Vesting Date unless such acceleration is permitted or required by Section 409A.  

(b)  Deferral  . In no event may the Company or the Participant defer the delivery of the Shares beyond the date specified in Section 3 of this Agreement, unless such deferral is permitted or required by Section 409A.  
    
  5.    Transferability  .  
    
  The PRSUs and shares they represent may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) (collectively, a    transfer   ), except that this Agreement may be transferred by the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise permitted under the Plan. The Participant may only transfer the Shares that may be issued pursuant to this Agreement following the Final Vesting Date that covers them.  
    
  6.    Withholding Taxes  .   
  (a)  The Participant acknowledges that the Participant has reviewed with the Participant s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the actions contemplated by this Agreement. The Participant affirms that the Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents.  
  (b)  The Company s obligation to deliver Shares to the Participant upon or after the vesting of the PRSUs shall be subject to the Participant s satisfaction of all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax related withholding requirements (   Withholding Taxes   ).  
  (c)  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any Withholding Taxes to be withheld with respect to the actions contemplated by this Agreement. 
  (d)  The Participant hereby authorizes the Company to reduce the number     of     Shares delivered to Participant at the applicable Final Vesting Date by the number     of     Shares required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements (based on the fair market value of shares at such time).  Participant s acknowledgement and acceptance of these tax withholding provisions are conditions precedent to the right of Participant to receive the Shares under the Plan and this Agreement. 
  (e)  In lieu of the reduction of Shares delivered to satisfy the Company s withholding obligations as described in paragraph (d) above, Participant may either (i) pay to the Company the amount of tax required to be withheld in cash, by check or in another form satisfactory to the Company ( Cash Payment ) or (ii) at such time as the Participant is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock, and the Participant is not subject to any restrictions on trading activities on the Common Stock imposed by the Company, the Participant may execute the instructions set forth in   Exhibit B   attached hereto (the    Automatic Sale Instructions   ) as the means of satisfying such tax obligation.  Any election to make a Cash Payment must be communicated to the Company no later than seven days prior to the date the restrictions lapse, and any Cash Payment must be made by the Vesting Date or such later date as is established by the Company (not to exceed 15 days after the Vesting Date on which the restrictions lapse).  Any Automatic Sale Instructions must be made not later than one month prior to a Vesting Date, and in the event the Participant subsequently cancels any Automatic Sale Instructions, he or she may not enter into any further Automatic Sale Instructions with regard to the Shares. 

7.    Securities Laws  .  
    
  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, the Company will not be required to issue, and the Participant may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock received as payment of the PRSUs, unless (a) there is in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock received as payment of the PRSUs a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state or foreign securities laws or an exemption from such registration, and (b) there has been obtained any other consent, approval or permit from any other regulatory body that the Compensation Committee (the    Committee   ) of the Company s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. The Company may condition such issuance, sale or transfer upon the receipt of any representations or agreements from the parties involved, and the placement of any legends on certificates representing Common Stock received as payment of the PRSUs, as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the Company to comply with such securities law or other restrictions.  
    
  8.    Provisions of the Plan 
    
  This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Participant with this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not defined in the Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.

The determination of the number of Shares payable with respect to a PRSU as to which the Service Condition and the Performance Vesting Condition have been satisfied shall be made in accordance with the performance payout matrix set forth in (ii) below.  Absent any contrary provision in Paragraph (b) below, if you cease to be employed by the Company for any reason or no reason, you will immediately and automatically forfeit all rights to any of your PRSUs.  The  Annual Target PRSU  shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing the Target PRSU by 3. 
  (i)      Service Condition  . The Service Condition is continued employment with (or provision of services to) the Company through the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
  (ii)      Performance Vesting Condition and Determination of Shares Earned  .  The number of Shares earned with respect to each PRSU as to which the Service Condition has been satisfied is based on the achievement of the following target:  

(iii)      Final Vesting Date  .  Payment on PRSUs pursuant to this Paragraph shall occur only after the Service Condition is satisfied (even though interim performance has been attained) and the Committee has certified in writing (which may be substantiated by the inclusion of such a determination in the minutes of a meeting of the Committee) that the Performance Vesting Condition and all other material terms applicable to such PRSU are satisfied (the  Final Vesting Date ).   
  (b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Final Vesting Date for all unvested PRSUs will be accelerated to the earliest of your death, Disability (as defined below) or immediately prior to a Change of Control (as defined below), and Shares shall be issued in respect of each such vested PRSU as set forth in this Paragraph (b). 
  (i)      Death or Disability  . In the event of your death or Disability (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(g)(4) or any successor regulation) , this PRSU shall fully vest and you or your estate shall receive pursuant to Section 3 the number of Shares earned in accordance with the table above based on any actually completed performance periods as of the date of your death or Disability. 
  (ii)      Change of Control  . In the event of a Change of Control of the Company, this PRSU shall fully vest immediately prior to the Change of Control and you shall receive immediately prior to such Change of Control the number of Shares earned in accordance with the table above based on interim performance measured through the Change of Control and treating the Change of Control as the last day of any completed and incomplete performance periods. 
  For purposes of this Agreement,  Change of Control  means the closing of (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation or reorganization of the Company into or with another Company or other legal person, after which merger, consolidation, liquidation or reorganization of the capital stock of the Company outstanding prior to consummation of the transaction is not converted into or exchanged for or does not represent more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the surviving or resulting entity; (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any person (as the term  person  is used in Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of more than 50% of the voting capital stock of the Company, in a single or series of related transactions; or (iii) the sale, exchange, or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company s assets (other than a sale, exchange or transfer to one or more entities where the stockholders of the Company immediately before such sale, exchange or transfer retain, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the beneficial interest in the voting stock of the entities to which the assets were transferred); provided that the event described in (i), (ii) or (iii) is also described in Code section 409A(2)(A)(v) and the regulations thereunder. 

Exhibit B 
  Automatic Sale Instructions 
  The undersigned hereby consents and agrees that any taxes due on a vesting date as a result of the vesting of PRSUs on such date shall be paid through an automatic sale of shares as follows: 
  (a)    Upon any vesting of PRSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the Company shall sell, or arrange for the sale of, such number of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to the PRSUs that vest pursuant to Section 2 as is sufficient to generate net proceeds sufficient to satisfy the Company s minimum statutory withholding obligations with respect to the income recognized by the Participant upon the vesting of the RSUs (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for all tax purposes, including payroll and social security taxes, that are applicable to such income), and the Company shall retain such net proceeds in satisfaction of such tax withholding obligations. 
    
  (b)    The Participant hereby appoints the Chief Financial Officer of the Company his attorney in fact to sell the Participant s shares of Common Stock in accordance with this   Annex A  .  The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this   Annex A  . 
    
  (c)    The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he or she is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock.  The Participant and the Company have structured this Agreement, including this   Annex A,   to qualify for the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act. 
    
  The Company shall not deliver any shares of Common Stock to the Participant until it is satisfied that all required withholdings have been made. 
    
  These instructions apply to the PRSUs that vest on (check all that apply):
