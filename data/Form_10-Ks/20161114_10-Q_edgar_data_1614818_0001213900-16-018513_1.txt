CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Report ) of CardConnect Corp. (the  Company ) contains forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company s or management s
expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections,
forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking
statements. The words  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate, 
 expect,   intend,   may,   might,   plan,   possible, 
 potential,   predict,   project,   should,   would,   will, 
 approximately,   shall  and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence
of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Report may include, for
example, statements about the benefits of the Merger (as defined herein) and the future financial performance of the Company.   

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on the Company. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of
which are beyond the Company s control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially
different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should any of the Company s or management s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in
material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ
include, but are not limited to:   

the
    Company s future financial performance;    

changes
    in the market for the Company s products;    

the
    ability to obtain or maintain the listing of the Company s common stock on NASDAQ following the Merger;    

the
    ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, and
    the ability of the combined business to grow and manage growth profitably;    

changes
    in applicable laws or regulations;    

the
    possibility that  the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors;
    and    

other
    risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading  Risk Factors.     

The
Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

Company Description, Operations and Basis of Presentation   

Company
Description and Operations   

CardConnect
Corp. (f/k/a FinTech Acquisition Corp.) ( CardConnect  or the  Company ) is a holding company that does
not have any operations or material assets other than the direct ownership of CardConnect, LLC. Prior to January 14, 2015, CardConnect,
LLC s legal name was Financial Transaction Services, LLC, which had been doing business as CardConnect since April 2013.
CardConnect, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is a provider of card-based payment processing services. CardConnect,
LLC facilitates the exchange of information and funds between merchants  and cardholders  financial institutions by
providing electronic payment processing services to merchants, including transaction authorization and electronic draft capture,
transaction clearing and settlement, merchant accounting and support, and risk management. CardConnect, LLC also offers a broad
range of technology solutions, including software, services and peripherals.  

The
Company was originally incorporated in Delaware in November 2013 as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose
of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination
with one or more businesses or assets. On July 29, 2016 (the  Closing Date ), the Company consummated its business
combination with FTS Holding Corporation ( FTS ) pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of March 7,
2016, as amended, by and among the Company, FinTech Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger
Sub ) and FTS (the  Merger Agreement ). Under the Merger Agreement, FTS merged with and into Merger Sub (the
 Merger ), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger. In connection with the closing of the Merger, the Company changed
its name from FinTech Acquisition Corp. to CardConnect Corp. and FinTech Merger Sub, Inc. changed its name to FTS Holding Corporation.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the  Company  refers to the combined company and its subsidiaries following
the Merger,  FinTech  refers to the company prior to the closing of the Merger and  FTS  refers to FTS
Holding Corporation prior to the Merger. See Note 3  for further discussion of the Merger.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary
for fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. It is recommended that these condensed consolidated
financial statements be read in conjunction with FTS s consolidated financial statements and related noted thereto for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by FinTech with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 12, 2016.  

The
Merger has been accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This determination was primarily based
on FTS s business comprising the ongoing operations of the Company following the Merger, FTS s senior
management comprising the senior management of the Company and FTS s stockholders having a majority of the voting power
of the Company. For accounting purposes, FinTech is considered the  acquired  company and FTS is considered
the  acquirer.  Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as the equivalent of FTS issuing
stock for the net assets of FinTech, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of FinTech are stated at historical
cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations
prior to the Closing Date of the Merger are those of FTS, and FinTech s assets, liabilities and results of operations
are consolidated with FTS beginning on the Closing Date. The shares and corresponding capital amounts  and earnings per
share available to common stockholders, pre-merger, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio
in the Merger. The historical financial information and operating results of FinTech prior to the Merger have not been
separately presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements as they were not significant or
meaningful.  

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CardConnect Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Collectively, the consolidated group is referred
to as  CardConnect  or the  Company.   

Preferred
Stock   

The
Company classifies its Series A Preferred Stock, issued in connection with the Merger, on its consolidated balance sheets using
the guidance in ASC 480-10-S99. The Series A Preferred Stock contains certain provisions that allow the holder to redeem the preferred
stock for cash, beginning seven years following the date of issuance, or if certain events occur, such as a change in control.
As redemption under these circumstances is not solely within the Company s control, the Series A Preferred Stock is classified
as temporary equity.  

Subsequent
Event   

The
Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial
statements are filed for potential recognition or disclosure.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify
the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This amendment is effective for annual reporting periods, including
interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance can be
applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We have elected to early adopt this guidance and apply it on a prospective
basis in 2015. Adoption of this accounting standards update ( ASU ) resulted in a reclassification of the Company s
net current deferred tax asset to the net long-term deferred tax liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted. 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued guidance that
requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the
statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to
make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. This amendment
is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2018.
In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
using a modified retrospective approach. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies
several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This amendment is effective for
annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The effect of this
update is still being evaluated and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards
for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects
to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us beginning in its first quarter
of 2019 and early adoption is permitted. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU
No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  ( ASU
2016-08 ); ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ); and ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ). We must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU
2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the  new revenue standards ). The new revenue standards may
be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date
of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standards
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that will change
the accounting for credit impairment. Under the new guidance, companies are required to measure all expected credit losses for
financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable
forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets
measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. This new guidance will be effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The effect of this update is still being evaluated and is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards
Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which adds or clarifies guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific
types of cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, with the intent of reducing diversity in practice. For
public entities, ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented; however,
entities may apply prospectively if retrospective application is impracticable. The effect of this update is still being evaluated
and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Business Combination   

Background
and Summary   

On the Closing Date, FinTech and FTS consummated
the previously announced transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things,
the acquisition of FTS by FinTech pursuant to the Merger.  In connection with the Merger, FinTech paid cash consideration
of approximately $179 million (including approximately $2 million of  Excess Cash  as defined in the Merger Agreement),
and issued 15,162,470 shares of common stock and options to purchase 3,463,950 shares of common stock. The cash portion of the
consideration was funded by a combination of cash held in trust by FinTech of $100 million, borrowings under a new $100 million
first lien secured credit facility and a $40 million second lien secured credit facility (See  Note 4. Debt First Lien
Facility  and   Second Lien Facility ), and $42.2 million in proceeds from the private placements of preferred
and common stock completed immediately prior to the Merger (See   Series A Preferred Stock Offering  and   Common
Stock Offering ). In connection with the Merger, on the Closing Date the Company redeemed  1,119,051
shares of its common stock at a redemption price of $10.01 per share pursuant to the terms of the Company s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, resulting in a total payment to redeeming stockholders of $11,201,698. Immediately following the
Merger, there were 1,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, 28,751,331 shares of common stock outstanding, outstanding
warrants to purchase 10,300,000 shares of common stock and outstanding options to purchase 6,854,429 shares of common stock.   

Series A Preferred Stock Offering  

On the Closing Date, in connection with
the partial financing of the Merger, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of newly created Series A Preferred Stock (the  Preferred
Stock ) and 480,544 shares of common stock (such shares of common stock, together with the Preferred Stock, the  Shares )
to Falcon Strategic Partners V, LP ( Series A Purchaser ) in a private placement pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Agreement with the Series A Purchaser dated June 23, 2016. The Shares were sold to the Series A Purchaser in a private placement
transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or Rule 506 of Regulation
D promulgated by the SEC. The Company incurred fees of $570,397 in connection with issuing the Preferred Stock, which were recorded
as a discount to the redeemable preferred stock on the condensed consolidated balance sheet on the date the offering closed. 

The aggregate purchase price for the Shares
was $37.5 million, of which $30.0 million was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger, to repay FTS s
existing debt in connection with the Merger, to pay transaction expenses relating to the Merger and for general corporate purposes,
and the remaining $7.5 million was placed in a separate restricted account for the sole purpose of funding the first two years
of cash dividends on the Preferred Stock. 

The
Preferred Stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of $37.5 million plus all unpaid dividends. During the first two years
following issuance, dividends accrue at a rate of 11.43% per annum, compounding quarterly, of which 10.0% will be payable in cash
and 1.43% will accrue and be payable in connection with a redemption of the Preferred Stock or a Change of Control (as in the
Certificate of Designation for the Preferred Stock). Thereafter, dividends accrue at 13.40% per annum, compounding quarterly,
all of which will accrue and be payable in connection with a redemption of the Preferred Stock or a Change of Control.  

The
Preferred Stock is redeemable, at the Series A Purchaser s option, beginning seven years following the date of issuance
(the  Mandatory Redemption Date ) at a price equal to the then aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding
Preferred Stock. The Company has the right (the  Optional Redemption Right ) to redeem the Preferred Stock beginning
three and a half years following the date of issuance. The redemption price (the  Redemption Price ) will be 102%
of the liquidation preference if the redemption occurs during the first redemption year, 101% of the liquidation preference if
the redemption occurs during the second redemption year, and 100% of the liquidation value thereafter.  

Common
Stock Offering   

On the Closing Date, in connection with the
partial financing of the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 467,647 shares of common stock (the  PIPE Shares )
to FTVENTURES III, L.P., FTVENTURES III-N, L.P. and FTVENTURES III-T, L.P., each a stockholder of FTS, certain other stockholders
of FTS and an affiliate of Betsy Cohen, a director of the Company (collectively, the  PIPE Investors ), pursuant to
securities purchase agreements with the PIPE Investors dated July 27, 2016. The PIPE Shares were sold to the PIPE Investors in
a private placement transaction (the  PIPE Transaction ) exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Of the PIPE Shares sold in the PIPE Transaction, 350,000 shares were sold at a purchase price
of $10.00 per share, and the remaining 117,647 shares, which were sold to the affiliate of Mrs. Cohen, were sold at a purchase
price of $10.20 per share, the most recent closing bid price of the Company s common stock, as required by applicable NASDAQ
Listing Rules. The closing of the PIPE Transaction occurred immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. The Company used the
proceeds from the PIPE Transaction to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger, repay FTS s existing debt
in connection with the Merger, pay transaction expenses relating to the Merger and redeem shares of common stock in connection
with the Merger pursuant to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The Company incurred fees of
$299,041 in connection with issuing the PIPE Shares, which were recorded as an adjustment to Additional Paid-In Capital at closing. 

Warrants  

There are outstanding warrants to purchase
an aggregate of 10,300,000 shares of the Company s common stock. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of

Debt   

The
Company s long-term debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consisted of the following:  

Prior
Credit Facility   

In
connection with the Merger, FTS repaid the outstanding balance of $57,964,989 under its 2012 revolving credit facility and terminated
the facility.     

In connection with the Merger, on the Closing
Date, the Company, through Merger Sub, entered into a credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. ( BMO ), as administrative
agent, for a first lien credit facility (the  First Lien Facility ), and entered into a second lien credit agreement
with Babson Capital Finance LLC, also acting as administrative agent, for a second lien term loan facility (the  Second
Lien Facility ). Each facility is guaranteed by the Company and its two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CardConnect,
LLC and Princeton Payment Solutions, LLC, and secured by a pledge of all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Company capitalized debt issuance costs of $6,047,141 in connection with the credit agreements, which will be amortized to interest
expense over the term of the credit agreements. The capitalized debt issuance costs are reported net with their debt liabilities
on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs was $191,182 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

First
Lien Facility    

The
First Lien Facility consists of a $30 million senior secured first lien revolving credit facility and a $100 million senior secured
first lien term credit facility.  The Company may increase the First Lien Facility by up to $35 million (less amounts obtained
from the related expansion feature under the Second Lien Facility), subject to customary restrictions and conditions. The First
Lien Facility matures on July 29, 2021 and bears interest at rates based either on the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate,
or LIBOR, plus a margin of between 2.00% and 3.50%, or, at the Company s option, BMO s base rate plus a margin of
between 1.00% and 2.50%, with the margin in each case depending upon consolidated total net leverage ratios (described below).
The term loan portion of the First Lien Facility will amortize $1.25 million per quarter beginning with the quarter ending December
31, 2016 through the quarter ending September 30, 2018; thereafter $1.875 million per quarter through the quarter ending September
30, 2020; and finally $2.5 million per quarter through the quarter ending June 30, 2021. At September 30, 2016, the interest rate
on the outstanding balance of the first lien term credit facility was 4.02%.  

The
Company may prepay the first lien credit facilities, without premium. The First Lien Facility requires mandatory prepayments,
without premium, in the following amounts:  

100%
    of the net cash proceeds of (i) sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business, (ii) sales of debt securities, and
    (iii) casualty or condemnation events (subject to specified thresholds and exceptions, including permitted reinvestment periods);
    and   

Second
Lien Credit Facility   

The
Second Lien Facility consists of a $40 million senior secured second lien term loan which has a $35 million expansion feature
similar to, and coordinated with, the expansion feature of the First Lien Facility such that the maximum aggregate expansion for
both such financings cannot exceed $35 million. The Second Lien Facility matures on July 29, 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR
plus 9.50% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) or, at the Company s option, the base rate (generally, the Wall Street Journal
 prime rate ) plus 8.50% (with a base rate floor of 2.00%). The Second Lien Facility does not amortize and may not
be prepaid prior to the payment in full of the First Lien Facility, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is permitted to
make payments under the Second Lien Facility out of the  available amount  (as defined under the First Lien Facility).
If voluntary prepayments (in addition to those allowed to be made from the available amount) become permitted (following payment
of the First Lien Facility in full), there will be a prepayment fee of 2% of the outstanding loan amount during the first loan
year, 1% of the outstanding loan amount in the second loan year and no prepayment fee thereafter. Mandatory prepayments are the
same as under the First Lien Facility but are conditioned on the prior repayment in full of the First Lien Facility.  At
September 30, 2016, the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the second lien term credit facility was 10.50%.  

5.
Stock-Based Compensation   

FTS
Holding Corporation 2010 Stock Option Plan   

In connection with the Merger, on the
Closing Date all unvested stock options of FTS became fully vested and all vested stock options were then immediately settled for
$9,716,492 of cash and options to purchase 3,463,950 shares of common stock of the Company. The Company recognized compensation
expense of $2,205,334 and $3,054,066 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which included

No stock options of FTS remain outstanding at September 30, 2016. 

CardConnect
Corp. 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan   

In connection with the Merger, on the
Closing Date the Company s stockholders approved the CardConnect Corp. 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the  2016
Plan ). Also in connection with the Merger, on the Closing Date the Company issued 26,388 shares of restricted stock and
options to purchase 3,390,479 shares of common stock under the 2016 Plan, and on August 9, 2016, the Company issued options to
purchase 379,429 shares of common stock under the 2016 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, there were 3,796,296 shares authorized for
issuance under the 2016 Plan and no shares available for issuance. 

Stock-based compensation is recognized
as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The stock options
issued under the 2016 Plan vest in four equal installments over four years. The Company recognized compensation expense for stock
options of $687,672 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there were 3,626,352 nonvested
stock options and unrecognized compensation expense of $15,816,449 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 3.8 years. 

The restricted stock issued under the 2016 Plan vests on the earlier
of (i) one day prior to the next regularly scheduled annual shareholders meeting, or (ii) one year from the grant date. The Company
recognized compensation expense for restricted stock of $46,662 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September
30, 2016, there was $233,315 of unrecognized compensation expense for the restricted stock. 

6.
Earnings per Share   

Basic
(loss) income per share is calculated by dividing net (loss) income attributable to the Company s common shareholders for
period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In computing dilutive (loss) income per share,
basic (loss) income per share is adjusted for the assumed issuance of all applicable potentially dilutive share-based awards,
including common stock options, restricted stock and warrants.  

Below
are basic and diluted net (loss) income per share for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands except share and per share data):  

7.
Income Taxes   

The
Company s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for
discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter the Company updates its estimate of the
annual effective tax rate and, if the Company s estimated tax rate changes, it makes a cumulative adjustment in that period.  

The
provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the resulting effective tax rates
were as follows:  

The
effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the federal statutory rate due to the expected increase
of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and the impact of indefinitely-lived intangible assets, which increased
the Company s effective tax rate by 37.2% and 6.0%, respectively, partially offset by a state tax benefit, which decreased
the Company s effective tax rate by 2.3%. The effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 differs from
the federal statutory rate due to an expected increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and state taxes,
which increased the Company s effective tax rate by 16.7% and 2.5%, respectively. The effective rate for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 differs from the federal statutory rate due to the expected increase of the valuation allowance against
our deferred tax assets and the impact of indefinitely-lived intangible assets, which increased the Company s effective
tax rate by 37.2% and 6.0%, respectively, partially offset by a state tax benefit, which decreased the Company s effective
tax rate by 2.3%. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 differs from the federal statutory rate due
to an expected increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and state taxes, which increased the Company s
effective tax rate by 16.7% and 2.5%, respectively.  

The
Company regularly evaluates its tax positions for additional unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties,
if applicable. There are many factors that are considered when evaluating these tax positions including: interpretation of tax
laws, recent tax litigation on a position, past audit or examination history, and subjective estimates and assumptions, which
have been deemed reasonable by management. The Company does not expect any material changes to unrecognized tax benefits in the
next twelve months. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions
was $221,584 and $116,258, respectively.

Company is party to a contract with First Data Merchant Services Corporation ( FDMS ), under which FDMS provides services
related to transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization, and data capture and access to reporting tools.
The contract expires on December 31, 2021, with successive renewal options of two years. The Company is required to pay minimum
services fees equal to 70% of the prior year s services fees paid to FDMS. The minimum services fee to be paid to FDMS in

The contract expires on October 31, 2020, with successive renewal options of two years. The Company is required to pay minimum
services fees each month of the contract equal to the greater of the contractually agreed upon amount for each processing year
or 70% of the average monthly volume over the last three months of the prior processing year. The minimum services fees to be

legal proceedings, which include all claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including unasserted claims, which are probable
of being asserted, arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company has considered all such ordinary course legal proceedings
as of September 30, 2016 in formulating its disclosures and assessments. In the opinion of the Company s management, based
on consultations with outside counsel, material losses are not considered reasonably possible in connection with these ordinary
course legal proceedings. 

The
Company leases office equipment and office space under operating agreements expiring through 2023. Rent expense on operating leases

Segments   

The
Company s core business is providing Merchant Acquiring services to Small and Medium sized Businesses ( SMB ).
The Company also provides services to larger Enterprise customers that primarily utilize sophisticated Enterprise Resource Planning
( ERP ) systems to manage their business. These services are primarily ERP integration services utilizing the Company s
secure hosted payment gateway, and may also include secure, point-to-point encryption ( P2PE ) payment terminals and
acceptance devices. The Company also provides Merchant Acquiring services to certain of its Enterprise customers. Merchant Acquiring
services provided to both SMB and Enterprise customers are aggregated for financial reporting purposes in the Merchant Acquiring
segment, as they both provide processing services related to bankcard transactions, exhibit similar economic characteristics,
and share the same systems to provide services. The Enterprise services business activity does not meet applicable materiality
thresholds for separate segment disclosure but is included as the primary component of an  all other  category under
GAAP as set forth below. The other category also includes corporate overhead expenses and non-recurring charges unrelated to Merchant
Acquiring services and Enterprise services.

Overview   

General   

Our
primary business is to provide Merchant Acquiring services to merchants throughout the United States. Merchant Acquiring services
involves providing end-to-end electronic payment processing services to merchants by facilitating the exchange of information
and funds between them and cardholders  financial institutions. To accomplish this, we undertake, or facilitate with third
parties, merchant set-up and training, transaction authorization, settlement, merchant funding, merchant assistance and support,
and risk management. We also provide integrated payment solutions utilizing our proprietary payment gateway. Our card-accepting
customers are primarily SMB merchants.  

We
also provide services to Enterprise customers that primarily utilize sophisticated ERP systems to manage their businesses. These
services are primarily ERP integration services utilizing our secure hosted payment gateway, and also include secure, P2PE payment
terminals and acceptance devices. We also provide Merchant Acquiring services to certain of our Enterprise customers.  

How
We Assess the Performance of Our Business   

Merchant
Acquiring Services   

We
use bankcard volume, number of active SMB merchants and same store sales to measure the performance of our Merchant Acquiring
services.  

Our
total bankcard volume for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively,
representing a period to period growth rate of 33.9%. Our total bankcard volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $16.4 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, representing a period to period growth rate of 33.2%.  

An active SMB merchant is a merchant that
has processed transactions in the relevant period. The number of our active SMB merchants located across the United States was
51,699 at September 30, 2016, compared to 48,400 at December 31, 2015 and 40,825 at September 30, 2015, representing growth rates
of 6.8% and 26.6%, respectively, over the periods. Bankcard volume reflects the addition of new merchants and same store sales
of existing merchants, partially offset by merchants who attrited during the period. We grow the number of active SMB merchants
through various distribution channels, which include independent sales organizations, integrated software vendors and our direct
sales staff. We also grow the number of active SMB merchants through acquisitions of complementary businesses. In connection with
our acquisition of Vanco Payment Solutions, Inc. ( Vanco ) in the fourth quarter of 2015, we added approximately 6,400
of our active SMB merchants. 

Our
Merchant Acquiring revenue is recurring in nature, as we typically enter into five-year service contracts with our merchants.
Our Merchant Acquiring revenue is generated primarily from payment processing fees, which are a combination of a fee equal to
a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction. We make mandatory payments of
interchange fees to the card issuer through the card networks and pay dues, assessments and other network fees to Visa, MasterCard,
American Express and Discover. Our Merchant Acquiring revenue is largely driven by the Visa and MasterCard volume processed by
our merchants. We also realize card processing revenues from processing transactions for our merchants accepting American Express
and from processing Discover transactions.  

Enterprise
Services   

Revenues
from our Enterprise services are largely driven by recurring fees charged for ERP integration and hosting services, and recurring
P2PE device fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue includes $1.3 million and $895 thousand, respectively,
of revenue related to Enterprise services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue includes $3.6 million
and $2.5 million, respectively, of revenue related to Enterprise services.  

Subsequent
Events   

On October 28, 2016, our stockholders
approved an amendment and restatement of the CardConnect Corp. 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the  2016 Plan )
that authorized an additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2016 Plan. The amendment and restatement
of the 2016 Plan increased the total shares authorized for issuance from 3,796,296 shares to 4,796,296 shares. 

On November 2, 2016, we entered into
Amendment No. 1 to our First Lien Facility (as defined below) and Amendment No. 1 to our Second Lien Facility (as defined below).
These amendments permit us to repurchase up to $2.5 million of our outstanding warrants on the terms set forth in such amendments. 

On November 2, 2016, the Company received
a notice from the staff (the  Staff ) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq ) stating that the Staff

Components
of Revenues and Expenses   

Revenues   

Revenue . Revenue
consists of card processing fees charged to merchants for card-based processing services. We charge merchants various rates for
our services, which depend upon various factors including the type of bankcard, card brand, the merchant s charge volume,
the merchant s industry and the merchant s risk profile. Fees principally consist of bankcard volume and transaction
fees, which are a percentage of the dollar amount of each credit or debit transaction and fixed transaction fees. We also generate
card processing revenues by charging merchants a variety of service fees, including fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements,
statement fees, annual fees, and fees for other miscellaneous services, including handling chargebacks. We also generate revenues
by selling our technology solutions, which include hardware and software products, maintenance, and professional installation
and training services.  

Expenses   

Cost
of services .   Cost of services consists of interchange and pass-through and other cost of services. Interchange
and pass-through consists of interchange fees, dues and assessment, debit network fees and other pass-through costs. We expect
interchange and pass-through to increase proportionately as a percentage of revenue. Other cost of services consists of commissions
to our distribution partners and internal sales staff and other third-party processing costs attributable to payment processing
and related services to merchants. Cost of services also includes merchant supplies and service expenses.  

General
and administrative . General and administrative expenses include salaries and other employment costs, professional services,
rent and utilities and other operating costs.  

Stock-based
compensation . Stock-based compensation reflects the amortization of the estimated fair value of share-based awards. We
recognize stock-based compensation as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally
the vesting period.  

Depreciation
and amortization of intangibles . Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on our investments in property, equipment
and computer hardware and software, and our amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed software. Depreciation
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense for acquired
intangible assets is recognized using a proportional cash flow method. Amortization expense for internally developed software
is recognized over the estimated useful life of the asset.  

Interest
expense, net.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, our interest expense consists of interest
on our outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 revolving credit facility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
our interest expense consists of interest on our outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 revolving credit facility and our 2016
First Lien Facility and 2016 Second Lien Facility.  

Factors
Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations   

A
number of factors impact our business, result of operations and financial condition including:  

the
    amount and mix of volume being processed;   

the
    demand for our products and services;   

our
    ability to attract and retain distribution partners and merchants on reasonable terms;   

our
    ability to attract and obtain Enterprise customers;   

our
    ability to capitalize on recent acquisitions and identify and complete future acquisitions;   

general
    economic conditions and consumer spending trends;   

the
    emergence of new technologies and payment types;   

selling, general and administrative expenses relating to compliance with regulations and requirements related to public companies; and    

interest expense.    

Increases
in payment network fees and other related costs have not historically had a material effect on the growth of our business or results
of our operations as such costs are generally passed through to our merchants.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The
following table shows certain data from the statements of operations for the periods indicated:  

Revenue   

Revenue
increased $36.2 million, or 30.7%, from $117.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $154.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by merchant growth and increased bankcard volume of $1.5 billion,
or 33.9%. The growth in bankcard volume consisted of bankcard volume from new merchants and same store sales of existing merchants,
partially offset by merchants who attrited during the same period. See   Overview  and   How We
Assess the Performance of Our Business.   

Cost
of Services   

Cost
of services increased $30.9 million, or 29.3%, from $105.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $136.4 million
in for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by increased interchange and pass-through and increased
other cost of services. Interchange and pass-through increased $26.2 million, or 30.1%, from $86.8 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 to $112.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by increased
bankcard volume as discussed above. Other cost of services increased $4.8 million, or 25.5%, from $18.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to $23.4 million in for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by
merchant growth and increased bankcard volume, resulting in increased commission expense to be paid to our distribution partners
and direct sales staff of $4.1 million, an increase in third-party processing costs of $919 thousand and an increase in merchant
losses of $220 thousand. The increases in other cost of services were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of equipment
sales of $614 thousand.   

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses increased $22.5 million, or 385.2%, from $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015
to $28.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by Merger related costs of $20.8 million,
primarily advisory fees of $10.5 million, compensation cost of $7.8 million and legal costs of $2.3 million. The increase also
reflects an increase in employment costs of $1.4 million due to an increase in headcount.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

Stock-based
compensation increased $2.5 million, or 536.9%, from $462 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by $1.9 million of additional expense recognized due to
the accelerated vesting of all outstanding FTS stock options in connection with the Merger and compensation expense recognized
for stock options granted under the 2016 Plan of $734 thousand, partially offset by 2011 and 2012
grants that became fully vested in 2015 and 2016 of $255 thousand.   

Depreciation
and Amortization   

Depreciation
and amortization increased $388 thousand, or 7.2%, from $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $5.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by amortization of intangible assets acquired
in the Vanco acquisition of $797 thousand and depreciation of fixed assets placed into service of $201 thousand. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related intangibles, excluding Vanco, of $489 thousand and a
decrease in amortization of residual buyouts of $75 thousand.   

Provision
for Income Taxes   

The
provision for income taxes increased $457 thousand, or 144.9%, from $315 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015
to $772 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The effective tax rates were (3.6)% and 65.5% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 differs from
the federal statutory rate due to the expected increase of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and the impact
of indefinitely-lived intangible assets, which increased the Company s effective tax rate by 37.2% and 6.0%, respectively,
partially offset by a state tax benefit, which decreased the Company s effective tax rate by 2.3%. The effective rate for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 differs from the federal statutory rate due to an expected increase in the valuation
allowance against our deferred tax assets and state taxes, which increased the Company s effective tax rate by 16.7% and
2.5%, respectively.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The
following table shows certain data from the statements of operations for the periods indicated:  

Revenue   

Revenue
increased $101.4 million, or 30.6%, from $331.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $432.5 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by merchant growth and increased bankcard volume of $4.1 billion,
or 33.2%. The growth in bankcard volume consisted of bankcard volume from new merchants and same store sales of existing merchants,
partially offset by merchants who attrited during the same period. See   Overview  and   How We
Assess the Performance of Our Business.   

Cost
of Services   

Cost
of services increased $90.1 million, or 30.6%, from $294.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $384.8
million in for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by increased interchange and pass-through
and increased other cost of services. Interchange and pass-through increased $74.2 million, or 30.5%, from $243.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $317.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was
driven by increased bankcard volume as discussed above. Other cost of services increased $16.0 million, or 31.2%, from $51.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $67.3 million in for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This
increase was driven by merchant growth and increased bankcard volume, resulting in increased commission expense to be paid to
our distribution partners and direct sales staff of $10.7 million, an increase in third-party processing costs of $3.0
million, an increase in the cost of equipment sales of $1.2 million and an increase in merchant losses of $678
thousand.   

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses increased $25.3 million, or 153.2%, from $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
to $41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by Merger related costs of $20.8 million,
primarily advisory fees of $10.5 million, compensation cost of $7.8 million and legal costs of $2.3 million. The increase also
reflects an increase in employment costs of $3.6 million due to an increase in headcount.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

Stock-based
compensation increased $2.4 million, or 173.6%, from $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by $1.9 million of additional expense recognized due to
the accelerated vesting of all outstanding FTS stock options in connection with the Merger, compensation expense recognized for
stock options granted under the 2016 Plan of $734 thousand and compensation expense recognized for
stock options granted in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $291 thousand, partially offset by 2011 and 2012 grants that became fully
vested in 2015 and 2016 of $469 thousand.   

Depreciation
and Amortization   

Depreciation
and amortization increased $1.4 million, or 8.8%, from $15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $16.7 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven by amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Vanco
acquisition of $2.4 million and depreciation of fixed assets placed into service of $524 thousand. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease in acquisition related intangibles, excluding Vanco, of $1.4 million.  

Provision
for Income Taxes   

The
provision for income taxes decreased $250 thousand, or 19.1%, from $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to
$ 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The effective tax rates were (6.0)% and 59.7% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 differs from
the federal statutory rate due to the expected increase of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and the impact
of indefinitely-lived intangible assets, which increased the Company s effective tax rate by 37.2% and 6.0%, respectively,
partially offset by a state tax benefit, which decreased the Company s effective tax rate by 2.3%. The effective rate for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 differs from the federal statutory rate due to an expected increase in the valuation
allowance against our deferred tax assets and state taxes, which increased the Company s effective tax rate by 16.7% and
2.5%, respectively.  

Seasonality   

We
have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer
spending patterns and recognition of non-transaction based fees. Historically, our revenues have been strongest in our third and
fourth quarters, and weakest in our first quarter. Some variability results from seasonal retail events and the number of business
days in a month or quarter. Operating expenses do not typically fluctuate seasonally.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

General    

Liquidity
and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding we need to meet our short and long-term cash and
working capital needs. We have used our funding sources to build our merchant portfolio, our technology solutions, and to make
acquisitions with the expectation that these investments will generate cash flows sufficient to cover our working capital needs
and other anticipated needs for capital.  

Our
principal uses of cash are to pay commissions to our distribution partners and internal sales staff, residual buyouts and distribution
partner advances, operating expenses, income taxes and interest expense, invest in our technology infrastructure and fund acquisitions.  

Our working capital, defined as current
assets less current liabilities, was positive by $16.4 million and $8.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The increase in working capital was primarily due to net proceeds received in connection with the Merger of $5.2 million. At September
30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.6 million compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents
do not include restricted cash, which reflects $6.8 million restricted for dividends on our preferred stock at September 30, 2016
and amounts due to merchants for processing-related cash in transit and collateral of $1.9 million and $1.6 million at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Our long-term debt at September 30, 2016
represents the outstanding balances under our First Lien Facility and Second Lien facility. The balance at December 31, 2015 represents
the outstanding balance under our prior 2012 revolving credit facility. Historically, we have used borrowings under our credit
facilities to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. In addition to borrowings under our credit facilities, we fund
our cash needs primarily with cash flows from our operating activities. We believe that our current cash balance, cash generated
from operations and borrowing capacity will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for operating capital for
at least the next twelve months.  However, we are subject to business, operational and other risks that could adversely affect
our cash flow. We may supplement our cash generation with proceeds from financing activities, including borrowings under our credit
facilities and other borrowings, the issuance of debt or additional equity, the sale of assets and other transactions. 

Cash
Flows    

The
following tables reflect the changes in cash flows for the comparative periods.  

Cash
Flow (Used In) Provided By Operating Activities.   

We reported net cash used in operating
activities of $44 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash provided by operating activities
of $18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cash
used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects net loss as adjusted for non-cash operating
items including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Additionally, the net cash used for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 reflects increases in accounts receivable of $4.3 million, other assets of $1.3 million and prepaid expenses
of $718 thousand. These uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in deferred revenue of $1.6 million, residuals payable
of $749 thousand, prepaid income taxes of $694 thousand and processing liabilities of $612 thousand.  

Cash
provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects net income as adjusted for non-cash operating
items including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Additionally, the net cash provided for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 reflects a decrease in prepaid income taxes of $1.2 million and increases in deferred revenue of $713
thousand and accounts payable of $580 thousand. These sources of cash were partially offset by increases in other current assets
of $274 thousand, accounts receivable of $236 thousand, and prepaid expenses of $219 thousand, and a decrease in accrued expenses
of $548 thousand.  

Cash
Flow Used In Investing Activities.   

Net
cash used in investing activities was $9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $11.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cash
flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects funding of residual buyouts of $9.5 million,
additions to our internally developed software of $2.4 million and property and equipment and leasehold improvements of $1.2 million.  

Cash
flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects funding of residual buyouts of $6.7 million,
additions to our internally developed software of $2.1 million and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements
of $1.9 million.  

Cash
Flow Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities.   

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $4.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cash flows provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects proceeds from borrowings under the Company s First Lien and Second
Lien Facilities of $140.0 million, net of debt issuance costs of $6.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $88.8
million, proceeds from the issuance of Series A preferred stock of $37.5 million, net of fees of $570 thousand, and proceeds from
the private placement of common stock of $4.7 million, net of fees of $299 thousand. These sources of cash were partially offset
by payments to holders of FTS and FinTech common stock of $179.4 million and payments under our credit facilities of $62.0 million.  

Cash
flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects pre-payments under our revolving credit
facility of $7.0 million, payment of contingent consideration of $3.7 million in connection with prior acquisitions and the purchase
of treasury stock of $2.7 million from our then non-executive chairman. These uses of cash were partially offset by borrowings
under our revolving credit facility of $9.2 million.  

Credit
Facilities   

On
the Closing Date, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, FTS repaid and terminated its 2012 revolving credit
facility (see  Recent Events Credit Facilities ) and we, through Merger Sub, entered into the First Lien
Facility and Second Lien Facility. Each facility is guaranteed by us and our two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries,
CardConnect, LLC and Princeton Payment Solutions, LLC, and secured by a pledge of all our assets and all assets of our
subsidiaries.  

First
Lien Facility   

The
First Lien Facility consists of the following:  

a
    $30 million senior secured first lien revolving credit facility, with a $10 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters
    of credit and a $5 million sublimit for swing line loans; and   

a
    $100 million senior secured first lien term credit facility.    

We
may increase the First Lien Facility by up to $35 million (less amounts obtained from the related expansion feature under the
Second Lien Facility), subject to customary restrictions and conditions, including compliance with specified leverage ratios (as
described below).  

The
First Lien Facility matures on July 29, 2021 and bears interest at rates based either on the three-month London Interbank Offered
Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin of between 2.00% and 3.50%, or, at our option, BMO s base rate plus a margin of between 1.00%
and 2.50%, with the margin in each case depending upon consolidated total net leverage ratios (described below). The term loan
portion of the First Lien Facility will amortize $1.25 million per quarter beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2016
through the quarter ending September 30, 2018; thereafter $1.875 million per quarter through the quarter ending September 30,
2020; and finally $2.5 million per quarter through the quarter ending June 30, 2021.  

We
may prepay the First Lien Facility, without premium. The First Lien Facility requires mandatory prepayments, without premium,
in the following amounts:  

100%
    of the net cash proceeds of (i) sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business, (ii) sales of debt securities, and
    (iii) casualty or condemnation events (subject to specified thresholds and exceptions, including permitted reinvestment periods);
    and   

The
first lien credit agreement contains covenants that are usual and customary for loans of this type, including affirmative and
operational covenants and restrictive covenants regarding, among other matters, incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, investments
(including an aggregate cumulative limit of $100 million plus the  available amount  (generally, the proceeds of equity
raised plus the balance available above the  Excess Cash Flow  used for prepayments, less amounts used as otherwise
permitted by the First Lien Facility, including other acquisitions, dividends and debt repayments) on acquisitions in excess of
$10 million during the term of the First Lien Facility), mergers, dispositions and specified uses of cash (including payment of
dividends and distributions). The first lien credit agreement also contains covenants requiring that we maintain:  

We were in compliance   with
these covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

In
general, the  fixed charge coverage ratio  is defined as the ratio of EBITDA (less unfinanced capital expenditures,
cash taxes and restricted payments, as defined) to the sum of scheduled debt principal payments over the most recently ended four
quarters; the  first lien leverage ratio  is defined as the ratio of senior secured debt (net of unrestricted cash
not to exceed $5.0 million) to EBITDA for the four fiscal quarter period most recently ended; and the  total leverage ratio 
is defined as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness (net of unrestricted cash not to exceed $5.0 million) to EBITDA for the four
fiscal quarter period most recently ended, with EBITDA to be determined on a pro forma basis.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $138.0 million outstanding under the First Lien Facility and the weighted average interest rate
on outstanding borrowings under this facility was 4.02%.  

Second
Lien Credit Facility   

The
Second Lien Facility consists of a $40 million senior secured second lien term loan which has a $35 million expansion feature
similar to, and coordinated with, the expansion feature of the First Lien Facility such that the maximum aggregate expansion for
both such financings cannot exceed $35 million. The Second Lien Facility matures on July 29, 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR
plus 9.50% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) or, at our option, the base rate (generally, the Wall Street Journal  prime rate )
plus 8.50% (with a base rate floor of 2.00%). The Second Lien Facility does not amortize and may not be prepaid prior to the payment
in full of the First Lien Facility, notwithstanding the foregoing, we are permitted to make payments under the Second Lien Facility
out of the  available amount  (as defined under the First Lien Facility). If voluntary prepayments (in addition to
those allowed to be made from the available amount) become permitted (following payment of the First Lien Facility in full), there
will be a prepayment fee of 2% of the outstanding loan amount during the first loan year, 1% of the outstanding loan amount in
the second loan year and no prepayment fee thereafter. Mandatory prepayments are the same as under the First Lien Facility but
are conditioned on the prior repayment in full of the First Lien Facility. The representations and covenants in the Second Lien
Facility are the same as those for the First Lien Facility, modified to reflect the second lien status of the Second Lien Facility,
except that the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is 1.00 to 1.00, the maximum total leverage ratio is 5.50 to 1.50, reducing
periodically until it becomes 4.25 to 1.00 for quarters subsequent to June 30, 2019, and there is no first lien leverage ratio
requirement.  We were in
compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2016.   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $40.0 million outstanding under the Second Lien Facility and the weighted average interest rate
on outstanding borrowings under this facility was 10.50%.  

Equity
Issuances   

Series
A Preferred Stock Offering   

In
connection with the partial financing of the Merger, on the Closing Date we issued 1,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock and 480,544
shares of common stock (together, the  Shares ) to the Series A Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement
with the Series A Purchaser dated June 23, 2016. The Shares were sold to the Series A Purchaser in a private placement transaction
exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC.  

The aggregate purchase price for the Shares
was $37.5 million, of which $30.0 million was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger, to repay FTS s
existing debt in connection with the Merger, to pay transaction expenses relating to the Merger and for general corporate purposes,
and the remaining $7.5 million was placed in a separate restricted account for the sole purpose of funding the first two years
of cash dividends on the Preferred Stock. 

The
Preferred Stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of $37.5 million plus all unpaid dividends. During the first two years
following issuance, dividends accrue at a rate of 11.43% per annum, compounding quarterly, of which 10.0% will be payable in cash
and 1.43% will accrue and be payable in connection with a redemption of the Preferred Stock or a Change of Control (as defined
below). Thereafter, dividends accrue at 13.40% per annum, compounding quarterly, all of which will accrue and be payable in connection
with a redemption of the Preferred Stock or a Change of Control (as defined below).  

The
Preferred Stock is redeemable, at the Series A Purchaser s option, beginning seven years following the date of issuance
(the  Mandatory Redemption Date ) at a price equal to the then aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding
Preferred Stock. We have the right (the  Optional Redemption Right ) to redeem the Preferred Stock beginning three
and a half years following the date of issuance. The redemption price (the  Redemption Price ) will be 102% of the
liquidation preference if the redemption occurs during the first redemption year, 101% of the liquidation preference if the redemption
occurs during the second redemption year, and 100% of the liquidation value thereafter.  

If
on the Mandatory Redemption Date any shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the dividend rate on the outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock will increase by 1.0% per annum, with the rate per annum being increased an additional 1.0% on the first day
of each successive 180 day period thereafter. In addition, if at any time, (1) the ratio of our indebtedness (including for this
purpose, the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) to its 12 month trailing EBITDA, on a pro forma basis, exceeds 7.7x,
or (2) there is a payment or financial covenant default under the First Lien Facility (each, a  Trigger Event ), the
dividend rate on the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock will increase upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event by the greater
of (A) any increase in the interest rate of the Second Lien Facility or (B) 1.0%, with the rate per annum being increased an additional
1.0% on the first day of each successive 180 day period. Any such additional rate increase described in the prior sentence shall
remain in effect until the default or Trigger Event has been cured, resolved or waived by the applicable party.  

In
addition, upon certain  Changes of Control  (as defined in the Certificate of Designation for the Preferred Stock
(the  Certificate of Designation )), if the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
request redemption of the Preferred Stock, we must repurchase all outstanding Preferred Stock at a price equal to the then-applicable
Redemption Price, or, if the Change of Control occurs during the period when the we are not permitted to exercise its Optional
Redemption Right, at a price equal to the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock plus a  make whole  premium.
The  make whole  premium is equal to the total value of the Preferred Stock dividends that would otherwise have been
payable during the period prior to the commencement of our Optional Redemption Right, discounted at the rate applicable to U.S.
Treasury bills or notes of similar duration plus 50 basis points, plus 2.0%.  

The
Preferred Stock is non-voting; however, the following actions will require the consent of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock:  

Changes
    to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws that adversely affect the powers, preferences, or rights of the Preferred Stock.   

Issuances
    of additional shares of Preferred Stock or other of our equity securities senior to, or parri passu with, the Preferred Stock,
    or issuances of capital stock by any of our subsidiaries other than issuances to us or one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.   

Reclassifications,
    alterations or amendments to any existing security of ours that is junior to the Preferred Stock in a way that would make
    such security senior to, or parri passu with, the Preferred Stock.   

Purchases
    or redemptions of, or distributions on, any of our capital stock other than the Preferred Stock, and other than certain specified
    redemptions of our common stock.   

Issuances
    of any debt security or the incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money and capital leases, other than certain permitted
    indebtedness, that (a) would result in the ratio of our indebtedness to our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, on a pro forma
    basis, exceeding 6.0x for the first 12 months following the issuance of the Preferred Stock, and exceeding 5.5x thereafter,
    or (b) includes terms that could prohibit us from paying the cash dividends payable on the Preferred Stock.   

Affiliate
    transactions resulting in payments of more than $150,000 per year, subject to certain specified exceptions.   

Changes
    in our tax status.   

Consummation
    of a Change of Control pursuant to which the consideration payable to our stockholders would be allocated in a manner other
    than as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.   

If
any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding following the Mandatory Redemption Date, or if at any time the ratio of our total
indebtedness (including for these purposes the liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock less any accumulated
dividends on the Preferred Stock) to our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, on a pro forma basis, exceeds 7.7x, then the following
actions will also require the consent of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock:  

A
    sale, in one or more transactions, of in excess of 27.5% of our consolidated net assets, except pursuant to a directed sale
    of assets in connection with a foreclosure by the lenders under the First Lien Facility.   

The
    liquidation, dissolutions or winding up of our business and affairs, a voluntary filing for bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency
    or other relief from creditors, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors other than as contemplated by the definitive
    agreements for the First Lien Facility.   

The
    issuance of equity securities below fair market value other than in an underwritten public offering or in a private placement
    in which at least a majority of the securities are purchased by persons or entities that are our affiliates.    

Common
Stock Offering   

On
the Closing Date, we issued and sold 467,647 shares of our common stock in the PIPE Transaction for an aggregate purchase price
of $4,700,000 pursuant to securities purchase agreements, dated July 27, 2016, with the PIPE Investors. The PIPE Investors included
the following persons and entities (i) FTVENTURES III, L.P., FTVENTURES III-N, L.P. and FTVENTURES III-T, L.P., each a stockholder
FTS (together, the  FTV Entities ), (ii) certain other stockholders of FTS and (iii) an affiliate of Betsy Cohen,
who is one of our directors. Of the shares sold in the PIPE Transaction, 350,000 shares were sold at a purchase price of $10.00
per share, and the remaining 117,647 shares, which were sold to the affiliate of Mrs. Cohen, were sold at a purchase price of
$10.20 per share, the most recent closing bid price of our common stock, as required by applicable NASDAQ Listing Rules. The PIPE
Shares were sold to the PIPE Investors in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act.  

The
closing of the PIPE Transaction occurred immediately prior to the closing of the Merger and the proceeds of the PIPE Transaction
were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger, repay FTS s existing debt in connection with the Merger,
pay transaction expenses relating to the Merger and redeem shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger pursuant to
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.  

All
of the shares purchased by the PIPE Investors are subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to a letter agreement entered into
in connection with the Merger (the  Letter Agreement ), which provides that (i) our stockholders party thereto will
not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock for a period of 180 days following the consummation
of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) certain of our stockholders waive their registration rights under the registration
rights agreement they entered into in connection with FinTech s initial public offering in February 2015.  

All
PIPE Shares purchased by the PIPE Investors, other than shares held by the affiliate of Betsy Cohen, are entitled to registration
rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Merger.  

Contractual
Obligations   

The card brand networks generally allow
chargebacks up to four months after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service
to the cardholder. If the merchant incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank, we are required
to do so. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we experienced merchant losses of $546 thousand and $326 thousand,
respectively, or 0.9 basis points and 0.7 basis points, respectively, on total bankcard dollar volumes processed of $5.8 billion
and $4.4 billion, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we experienced merchant losses of $1.8 million
and $1.1 million, respectively, or 1.1 basis points and 0.9 basis points, respectively, on total bankcard dollar volumes processed
of $16.4 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively. These losses are included in cost of services in our consolidated statements
of operations. 

The
following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments for the periods indicated as of September 30, 2016.  

(a)  
      We
    have agreements with our third-party processors to provide to us, on a non-exclusive basis, payment processing and transmittal,
    transaction authorization and data capture services, and access to various reporting tools. Our agreements with third-party
    processors require us to submit a minimum annual number of transactions or volume for processing. If we submit a number of
    transactions or volume that is lower than the minimum, we are required to pay the third-party processors the fees that they
    would have received if we had submitted the required minimum number or volume of transactions.   

(b)  
      Interest
    on long-term debt includes monthly and quarterly interest on First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility at interest rates
    of 4.02% and 10.50%, respectively, and a 0.50% unused commitment fee on the unused balance of the first lien revolving credit
    facility.   

Unrecognized
Tax Benefits .    

At
September 30, 2016, we had gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits of $222 thousand. As of September 30, 2016, we were unable
to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority, therefore the unrecognized
tax benefits have been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any transactions with third parties or unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated
retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent
liabilities or other obligations other than for chargebacks.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that such estimates have been based on reasonable and supportable assumptions
and the resulting estimates are reasonable for use in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. Our significant estimates include estimates for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets,
fair value of deliverables in multiple element arrangements, stock-based compensation and income tax valuation allowances. 

Accounting policies are an integral part of our financial
statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations
and our financial position. Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates involve the most difficult
management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. For a description of our critical accounting
policies, refer to  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  in  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our Form S-1 filed with the SEC on August 25, 2016. There have been
no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and we adopted
the following policy for our Series A Preferred Stock. 

Preferred Stock  

We
classify our Series A Preferred Stock, issued in connection with the Merger, on our consolidated balance sheets using the guidance
in ASC 480-10-S99. The Series A Preferred Stock contains certain provisions that allow the holder to redeem the preferred stock
for cash beginning seven years following the date of issuance or if certain events occur, such as a change in control. As redemption
under these circumstances is not solely within our control, we have classified the Series A Preferred Stock as temporary equity.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

See
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of
recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on us.  

Effects
of Inflation   

While
inflation may impact our revenues and cost of services, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations
and financial condition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial
condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.  

Qualitative
and Quantitative Disclosure about Market Risk   

Interest
rate risk   

Our
credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin. As of September 30, 2016, we had $138.0
million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in the interest rate on
our indebtedness as of September 30, 2016 would have increased or decreased cash interest expense on our indebtedness by approximately
$1.4 million per annum.  

Foreign
exchange risk   

Invoices
for our services are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not expect our future operating results to be significantly affected by
foreign currency transaction risk.  

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures    

Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management establishes and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
to ensure that the information we disclose under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is properly and timely reported. We provide
this information to our chief executive and chief financial officers as appropriate to allow for timely decisions.  

Our
controls and procedures are based on assumptions. Additionally, even effective controls and procedures only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our controls and procedures will succeed or be
adhered to in all circumstances.  

We
have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures with the participation, and under the supervision, of our management, including
our chief executive and chief financial officers. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive and chief financial officers have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) occurred during
the period covered by this report that has affected or is reasonably likely to affect materially our internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings    

We
are party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that
as of September 30, 2016, none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.  

Item 1A.
Risk Factors    

In
addition to the information set forth below, see  Risk Factors Risks Relating to CardConnect s Business 
beginning on page 25 of the Prospectus, which is incorporated herein by reference.  

Risk
Relating to Indebtedness   

We
have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect its results of
operations and financial condition.    

As
of September 30, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $138.0 million, consisting of amounts outstanding under the First Lien Facility
and the Second Lien Facility entered into in connection with the Merger.  

Our
indebtedness may have important consequences to our investors, including, but not limited to:  

increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;   

requiring
    the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on,
    its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
    joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;   

limiting
    our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment; and   

limiting
    our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.   

Pursuant
to the credit agreements for the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility (together, the  Credit Facilities ),
interest rates payable with respect to the First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility vary at stated margins above either LIBOR
or BMO s base rate. An increase in interest rates would adversely affect our profitability.  

Upon
the occurrence of an event of default relating to our Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to accelerate payments due and
terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Consequently, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the amounts outstanding
under the Credit Facilities, as well as other secured and unsecured indebtedness.    

The
credit agreements for the Credit Facilities provide that upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders will be able
to elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments
to lend additional funds. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders for the Credit Facilities could proceed to foreclose
against the collateral we granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We pledged substantially all of our and our subsidiaries 
assets as collateral for the Credit Facilities. If the lenders for the Credit Facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings,
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, as well
as any other secured and unsecured indebtedness, and if the lenders foreclose on our assets, it could render our common stock
worthless.  

The
credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and the terms of our outstanding Preferred Stock issued as partial financing for the
Merger contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to conduct business.    

The
credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and the terms of our Preferred Stock contain operating covenants and financial covenants
that may in each case limit management s discretion with respect to certain business matters. Among other things, these
covenants restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, change the nature of our business, sell or otherwise
dispose of assets, make acquisitions, and merge or consolidate with other entities. As a result of these covenants and restrictions,
we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or other financing to compete effectively
or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive
covenants. Failure to comply with such restrictive covenants may lead to default and acceleration under the credit agreements
for the Credit Facilities and may impair our ability to conduct business. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these
covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants,
which may result in foreclosure on our assets and our common stock becoming worthless.  

Risks
Relating to Our Corporate Structure and the Merger   

Following
the consummation of the Merger, our only significant asset is ownership of CardConnect s business through our 100% ownership
interest in Merger Sub. If CardConnect s business is not profitably operated, Merger Sub may be unable to pay us dividends
or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.    

Following
the consummation of the Merger, we have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of Merger Sub,
which, through its subsidiaries, operates CardConnect s business. We will depend on profits generated by CardConnect s
business for distributions, debt repayment and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations,
including our expenses as a publicly traded company, and to pay any dividends with respect to our capital stock. Legal and contractual
restrictions in the credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and any future indebtedness, as well as our financial condition
and operating requirements, may limit our ability to receive distributions from Merger Sub and the CardConnect business.  

Provisions
in our charter and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in
the future for our common stock and could entrench management.    

Our
charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best
interests. These provisions include the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred
shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment
of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.  

A
market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.    

The
price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market s reaction to the Merger and general market and economic
conditions. An active trading market for our securities following the Merger may never develop or, if developed, it may not be
sustained.  

NASDAQ may not continue to list our securities on its
exchange, and we may be unable to satisfy listing requirements in the future, which could limit investors  ability to effect
transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.   

As a result of the Merger, NASDAQ rules
require that we apply to continue the listing of our common stock and warrants. While we have applied to have our common stock
and warrants continue to be listed on NASDAQ upon consummation of the Merger, we must meet NASDAQ s initial listing requirements.
We may be unable to meet those requirements. Even if our securities are listed on NASDAQ following the Merger, we may be unable
to maintain the listing of our securities in the future. 

If we fail to meet the initial listing requirements
and NASDAQ does not list our securities on its exchange, or if we are delisted, there could be significant material adverse consequences,
including: 

a
    limited availability of market quotations for our securities;   

a
    limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the combined Company; and   

a
    decreased ability to obtain capital or pursue acquisitions by issuing additional equity or convertible securities.    

We
will incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.    

As
a privately held company, FTS was not required to comply with many corporate governance and financial reporting practices and
policies required of a publicly traded company. As a publicly traded company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and
other expenses that FTS did not incur in the recent past. These expenses will increase once we are no longer an  emerging
growth company  as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. In addition, new and
changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure for public companies, including
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, regulations related hereto and
the rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ, have increased the costs and the time that must be devoted to compliance matters.
We expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial costs and lead to a diversion of management time and
attention from revenue-generating activities.  

For
as long as we remain an  emerging growth company  as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies. 
We may remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years from FinTech s initial public offering (the
 IPO ) or until such earlier time that we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700.0 million
in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year
period. To the extent we choose not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, or if we no longer
can be classified as an  emerging growth company,  we expect that we will incur additional compliance costs, which
will reduce our ability to operate profitably.  

As
an  emerging growth company,  we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to  emerging
growth companies  will make our common stock less attractive to investors.    

As
an  emerging growth company,  we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
are applicable to other public companies, including not being required to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions
from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which we have elected to do.  

We
cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors
find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for our common stock, our share price may
be more volatile and the price at which our securities trade could be less than if we did not use these exemptions.  

If
we do not develop and implement all required accounting practices and policies, we may be unable to provide the financial information
required of a U.S. publicly traded company in a timely and reliable manner.    

Prior
to the Merger, FTS was a privately held company and as such was not required to adopt all of the financial reporting and
disclosure procedures and controls required of a U.S. publicly traded company. We expect that the implementation of all required
accounting practices and policies and the hiring of additional financial staff will increase our operating costs following the
Merger and could require our management to devote significant time and resources to such implementation. If we fail to develop
and maintain effective internal controls and procedures and disclosure procedures and controls, we may be unable to provide financial
information and required SEC reports that are timely and reliable. Any such delays or deficiencies could harm us, including by
limiting our ability to obtain financing, either in the public capital markets or from private sources and damaging our reputation,
which in either cause could impede our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, any such delays or deficiencies
could result in our failure to meet the requirements for continued listing of our common stock on NASDAQ.  

We
may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities without stockholder approval, which would dilute out existing
shareholder s ownership interests in us and may depress the market price of our common stock.    

We
may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities in the future in connection with, among other things, future
acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness without shareholder approval in a number of circumstances.  

Our
issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities could have one or more of the following effects:  

our
    existing shareholders  proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;   

the
    amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;   

the
    relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of common stock may be diminished; and   

the
    market price of our common stock may decline.    

If
our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our securities may decline.    

If
our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, fluctuations in the
price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the Merger, there was no public
market for FTS s stock and trading in FinTech s common stock was not active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to
the Company and our common stock in the Merger may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following
the Merger. Even if an active market for our common stock exists, the market price of our common stock could be volatile and subject
to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could
have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  

Factors
affecting the market price of our common stock may include:  

actual
    or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to
    be similar to us;   

changes
    in the market s expectations about our operating results;   

success
    of competitors;   

our
    operating results failing to meet market expectations in a particular period;   

changes
    in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the payments processing industry and market
    in general;   

operating
    and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;   

our
    ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;   

changes
    in laws and regulations affecting our business;   

commencement
    of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;   

changes
    in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;   

the
    volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;   

any
    significant change in our board or management;   

sales
    of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception
    that such sales could occur; and   

general
    economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and
    acts of war or terrorism.   

Broad
market and industry factors may depress the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock
market in general and NASDAQ have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our
securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for financial technology stocks or the stocks
of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects,
financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock also could adversely affect our
ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.  

Warrants
to purchase our common stock are currently exercisable, which could increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in
the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.    

There
are outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,300,000 shares of our common stock. These warrants consist of 10,000,000
warrants originally included in the units issued in the IPO and 300,000 warrants included in the placement units issued in connection
with the IPO. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $12.00 per share
and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on July 29, 2021, or earlier upon our liquidation. To the extent warrants are exercised,
additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and increase
the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market
could depress the market price of our common stock.  

We
may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 that will be applicable to us after the Merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.    

As
a private company, FTS was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, following the Merger, we are required
to provide management s attestation on internal controls commencing with the Company s annual report for the year
ending December 31, 2017. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly
more stringent than those required of FTS as a privately-held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement
controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable
to us after the Merger. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with
adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which
may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and lead to a decrease in the market price
of our common stock.  

Pursuant
to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an  emerging
growth company.     

Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm
will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an  emerging growth company.  We will be an  emerging growth company 
until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 12, 2020, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b)
in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day
of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during
the prior three-year period. Accordingly, until we cease being an  emerging growth company  stockholders will not
have the benefit of an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our interest comfort environment.  

Our
ability to successfully operate the business depends largely upon the efforts of certain key personnel. The loss of such key personnel
could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the post-combination business.    

Our
ability to recognize certain benefits of the Merger and successfully operate CardConnect s business following the Merger
will depend upon the efforts of certain key personnel of FTS. The unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations
and profitability. In addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and retain key personnel to succeed
senior management. Furthermore, our key personnel include the key personal of FTS. While the skills, abilities and qualifications
of the key FTS personnel were closely scrutinized during the due diligence process in connection with the Merger, the assessment
may not prove to be correct. If such personnel do not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities expected or those necessary
to manage a public company, our operations and profitability of our business may be negatively impacted.  

Our
ability to meet expectations and projections in any research or reports published by securities or industry analysts, or a lack
of coverage by securities or industry analysts, could result in a depressed market price and limited liquidity for our common
stock.    

The
trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish
about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover the combined Company,
our stock price would likely be less than if we had such coverage and the liquidity, or trading volume of our common stock may
be limited, making it more difficult for a stockholder to sell shares at an acceptable price or amount. The projections of any
analysts that do cover the combined Company may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our
share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of research analysts covering us. Similarly, if one
or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our
business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on
us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.  

Future
sales of our common stock issued to FTS shareholders may reduce the market price of our common stock that you might otherwise
obtain.    

Under
the Merger Agreement, the FTS shareholders received as consideration in the Merger, among other things, an aggregate of15,162,470
shares of our common stock and options to purchase 3,463,950 shares of our common stock. Certain FTS stockholders also purchased
an aggregate of 350,000 shares of unregistered common stock in the PIPE Transaction. The FTS stockholders are restricted from
transferring any shares of our common stock that they receive as a result of the Merger until the earlier of (i) the completion
of a secondary underwritten offering (the  Follow On Offering ) that we are required to consummate within 12 months
following the Merger pursuant the registration rights agreement described in the following paragraph, and (ii) 180 days after
the closing of the Merger, subject to certain limited exceptions.  

Upon
the closing of the Merger we entered into a registration rights agreement with the FTS stockholders (the  Registration Rights
Agreement ), with respect to the shares of our common stock that were issued to former FTS stockholders under the Merger
Agreement and in the PIPE Transaction. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Follow On Offering, which will be a registered underwritten public offering of shares of our common
stock held by any FTS holder that elects to participate in such offering. Under the Registration Rights Agreement have also agreed
to file a registration statement to register any shares of our common stock held by the FTV Entities for resale (the  FTV
Shelf Registration Statement ). If the FTV Shelf Registration Statement is unavailable, the FTV Entities will have certain
demand and piggyback registration rights.  

Upon
expiration of the lockup period applicable to shares of our common stock held by the FTS stockholders, effectiveness of the registration
statement we file for the Follow On Offering, or effectiveness of the FTV Shelf, these parties may sell large amounts of our stock
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The registration and availability of such a significant number of
shares of common stock for trading in the public market may increase the volatility in our stock price or put significant downward
pressure on the price of our stock. In addition, we may use shares of our common stock as consideration for future acquisitions,
which could further dilute our stockholders.  

Under
the Merger Agreement we have no right to seek indemnification from FTS shareholders following the Merger.    

The
representations, warranties and covenants made by FTS in the Merger Agreement did not survive closing and are not subject to indemnification.
As a result, if FTS is found to have breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in the Merger Agreement,
other than those covenants that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part at or after the closing of the
Merger, we have no recourse against FTS s former shareholders other than for actual fraud.  

We
may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges following the Merger that could
have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to
lose some or all of your investment.    

Although
FinTech s management conducted a due diligence examination of FTS, we cannot assure you that this examination revealed all
material issues that may be present in FTS s business, or that factors outside of our and FTS s control will not later
arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment
or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence successfully identified certain risks, unexpected risks
may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though
these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this
nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause
us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.

    resulting in a total payment to redeeming stockholders of approximately $11,201,701.

 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH SCOTT DOWTY, AS AMENDED

Exhibit 10.13  

CARDCONNECT, LLC    

AMENDED
AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   

This
AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the   Agreement  ) is made as of July 29, 2016, by and between 
 FinTech Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (  Parent  ), CardConnect, LLC (f/k/a   Financial
Transaction Services, LLC), a   Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the   Company  ),
and Scott Dowty (  Executive  ).  

WHEREAS,
effective as of the date hereof, FTS Holding Corporation, the Company s parent corporation, merged with and into FinTech
Merger Sub, Inc. (the   Merger  ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and the entity surviving the merger changed
its name to FTS Holding Corporation (  FTS  );  

WHEREAS,
in connection with the Merger, the Company and the Executive desire to modify certain terms of the Employment Agreement between
such parties dated as of September 12, 2014, as amended October 2015 (the   Original Employment Agreement  );
and  

WHEREAS,
this Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Original Employment Agreement.  

In
consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:  

1.                 
 Employment . Parent and the Company shall employ Executive, and Executive hereby accepts employment with Parent and the
Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement for the period beginning on the date hereof and ending as provided
in  Section 4  hereof (the   Employment Period  ).  

2.                 
 Position and Duties .  

(a)         
During the Employment Period, Executive shall serve as the Executive Vice President   Enterprise Sales of Parent, the Company
and their Subsidiaries (as defined below) and shall have the normal duties, responsibilities, and authority of an executive serving
in such position subject to the direction of Parent s Chief Executive Officer and Parent s board of directors (the
  Board  ).  

(b)        
Executive shall report to Parent s Chief Executive Officer and the Board and shall devote his best efforts and full business
time and attention (except for permitted vacation periods and reasonable periods of illness or other incapacity) to the business
and affairs of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries. Executive shall perform his duties, responsibilities and functions
to Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries hereunder in good faith and to the best of his abilities in a diligent, trustworthy,
professional and efficient manner and shall comply with Parent s , the Company s and their Subsidiaries  policies
and procedures in all material respects. So long as Executive is employed by Parent or the Company, Executive shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Board (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), accept other employment or perform
other services for compensation;  provided , that Executive may (i) serve as an officer or director of or otherwise participate
in purely educational, welfare, social, religious and civic organizations so long as such activities do not materially interfere
with Executive s services and obligations hereunder, (ii) serve as an officer or director of the board for the Astound Group
in Toronto, Canada, so long as such activities do not materially interfere with Executive s services and obligations hereunder
and (iii) make and manage personal investments of his choice so long as such activities do not materially interfere with
Executive s services and obligations hereunder.  

(c)         
Executive shall perform his duties hereunder in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is understood that Executive shall undertake such business
travel as reasonably required by Parent or the Company to perform his duties and responsibilities.  

(d)        
For purposes of this Agreement   Subsidiaries   shall mean any corporation or other entity of which the securities
or other ownership interests having the voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing body are,
at the time of determination, owned by Parent or the Company, directly or through one of more Subsidiaries.  

3.                 
 Compensation and Benefits .  

(a)         
During the Employment Period, Executive s base salary shall be two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per annum,
subject to increase as approved by Parent s compensation committee (the   Base Salary  ), which salary
shall be payable by Parent in regular installments in accordance with Parent s general payroll practices (in effect from
time to time).   In addition, during the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to participate in all of Parent s
and the Company s vacation, paid holidays, medical and other employee benefit programs for which members of Parent, the
Company and their Subsidiaries  executive management team are generally eligible. Executive shall be entitled to six (6)
weeks of paid time off each calendar year, which if not taken during any year may not be carried forward to any subsequent year
and no compensation shall be payable in lieu thereof, except as otherwise required by law.  

(b)       
During the Employment Period, Parent shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable business expenses incurred by Executive in the
course of performing his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement which are consistent with Parent s policies in
effect from time to time with respect to travel, entertainment and other business expenses, subject to Parent s requirements
with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses.  

(c)          All expenses or other reimbursements under this Agreement which would be deemed taxable income to the Executive shall be made
on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive.
Any right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and no such reimbursement,
expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible
for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year.  

(d)         
In addition to the Base Salary, Executive shall be eligible to receive, in respect of each full calendar year, subject to his
continued employment through the last day of each calendar year and at the discretion of Parent s compensation committee,
a bonus based on the performance of the Company, as measured by the Company s achievement of certain target(s) approved
by Parent s compensation committee. All amounts payable pursuant to this subsection shall be payable in cash to Executive
within fourteen (14) days following completion of the annual accounting audit of Parent and the Company, but in any event no later
than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third month following the fiscal year in respect of which such payment is earned or as soon
as administratively practicable within the meaning of Code Section 409A (as defined below).  

4.                 
 Term .  

(a)        
The Employment Period shall end on the   fifth (5th) anniversary of the date hereof and shall automatically be renewed on
the same terms and conditions set forth herein as modified from time to time by the parties hereto for additional one-year periods
beginning on such fifth (5th) anniversary unless either party notifies the other no later than sixty (60) days prior to the end
of the then current term that it does not wish to renew the Agreement;  provided , that (i) the Employment Period shall terminate
immediately upon Executive s resignation with Good Reason or without Good Reason, death or Disability, and (ii) the Employment
Period may be terminated by Parent at the sole discretion of the Board at any time for Cause or without Cause. Any termination
of the Employment Period by Parent shall be effective as specified in a written notice from Parent to Executive.  

(b)        
If the Employment Period is terminated by Parent without Cause (other than as a result of Executive s Disability) or by
Executive with Good Reason, Executive shall be entitled to (i) a lump sum cash payment within fourteen (14) days following the
date of his termination of employment equal to the sum of (A) his accrued but unused vacation, (B) Base Salary payable through
the date of termination, (C) any accrued but unpaid bonus or incentive compensation earned by Executive for a prior fiscal year,
(D) any bonus which would have been payable to Executive under  Section 3(d)  with respect to the year in which the Employment
Period was terminated but for such termination of the Employment Period, prorated on the basis of the number of full days of service
rendered by Executive during such year, and (E) any unreimbursed business expenses that are reimbursable in accordance with  Section
3(b) , and (ii) an amount equal to twelve (12) months of Executive s Base Salary, less applicable withholdings and deductions,
such amounts payable in regular installments in accordance with Parent s normal payroll practices at the time of termination
over a period of twelve (12) months commencing on the date the Employment Period is terminated (the   Severance Period  ),
in each case if and only if Executive has executed and delivered to Parent and the Company the Parent s standard, a general
release in form and substance satisfactory to the Board (the   Release  ) within thirty (30) days of such termination
and only so long as Executive has not revoked or breached the provisions of such Release or breached the provisions of  Sections
5 ,  6  and  7  hereof during the Severance Period. Executive shall forfeit all rights to payment under clause (ii)
of this  Section 4(b)  unless the Release is signed and delivered (and no longer subject to revocation, if applicable) within
thirty (30) days following the date of Executive s termination of employment. Subject to the provisions of  Section 24 ,
if the general release is executed and delivered and no longer subject to revocation as provided in the preceding sentence, then
payments under clause (ii) of this  Section 4(b)  shall be made or commence upon the thirtieth (30 th ) day following
Executive s termination of employment. The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would
have been due prior thereto under the terms of this Agreement had such payments commenced immediately upon Executive s termination
of employment, and any payments made thereafter shall continue in accordance with Parent  s payroll practices at the time
of termination. In addition, if Executive elects to continue and pays his health insurance coverage under Section 4980B of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (  COBRA  ), following the termination of Executive s employment,
then Parent shall pay or reimburse Executive for the portion of the monthly premium under COBRA for such coverage in excess of
the portion paid by active employees for similar coverage until the earliest of (x) the expiration of the Severance Period
and (y) the date Executive receives substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment
or self-employment.  

(c)         
If the Employment Period is terminated (i) by Parent for Cause, (ii) due to Executive s death or Disability, or (iii) by
Executive s resignation without Good Reason, Executive shall be entitled to receive his Base Salary through the date of
such termination, any accrued but unused vacation, any accrued but unpaid bonus or incentive compensation earned by Executive
for a prior fiscal year, and unreimbursed business expenses that are reimbursable in accordance with  Section 3(b) , all
of which shall be payable in a lump sum cash payment within fourteen (14) days following the date of his termination of employment.  

(d)        
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Executive shall not be entitled to any other salary, bonuses, employee benefits
or compensation from Parent, the Company or their Subsidiaries after the termination of the Employment Period and all of Executive s
rights to salary, bonuses, employee benefits and other compensation hereunder which would have accrued or become payable after
the termination of the Employment Period (other than vested retirement or other benefits accrued on or prior to the termination
of the Employment Period (including, without limitation, any vested rights under any equity incentive plan of Parent or the Company)
or other amounts owing hereunder as of the date of such termination that have not yet been paid) shall cease upon such termination,
other than those expressly required under applicable law (such as COBRA).  

(e)        
Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries may offset any amounts Executive owes Parent, the Company or such Subsidiaries against
any amounts Parent, the Company or such Subsidiaries, as applicable, owes Executive hereunder, except as provided in  Section
24(e)  or under applicable law.  

(f)         
For purposes of this Agreement,   Cause   shall mean with respect to Executive one or more of the following:
(i) the conviction of, or plea of no contest by, Executive with respect to a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude offense
if, and only if, it is determined by the Board that such event has occurred and merits termination of the Executive s employment
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the commission of any other act or omission by Executive involving misappropriation, embezzlement,
dishonesty, theft or fraud with respect to Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their business relationships,
(iii) Executive s illegal possession of a controlled substance, use of illegal drugs or repetitive abuse of alcohol or other
behavior which materially interferes with the performance of his duties to Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary or which compromises
the integrity and reputation of Executive, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiaries, (iv) Executive s failure to substantially
perform material duties as reasonably directed by Parent s Chief Executive Officer or the Board in accordance with this
Agreement continuing beyond thirty (30) days  prior written notice of such failure, (v) Executive s willful act
or omission aiding or abetting a competitor of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries to the material disadvantage or
detriment of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries, (vi) Executive s willful failure to comply in all material respects
with Parent and the Company s material policies, procedures and guidelines, including corporate governance and human relations
policies, and applicable laws with respect to Parent s and the Company s business operations, (vii) Executive s
breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries,
or (viii) any other material breach by Executive of this Agreement which is not cured to the Board s reasonable satisfaction
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Executive. For purposes of clauses (v), (vi) and (vii) above, no act or
failure to act on the part of Executive shall be considered  willful  unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by
Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that Executive s action or omission was in the best interests of Parent
or the Company.  

(g)         
The Executive s   Disability   shall be deemed to have occurred only if, as a result of his incapacity
due to physical or mental illness, Executive is considered disabled under the Company s or Parent s long-term disability
insurance plans.  

(h)        
For purposes of this Agreement,   Good Reason   shall mean if Executive resigns from employment with Parent or
the Company prior to the end of the Employment Period as a result of one or more of the following reasons: (i) any material breach
by Parent or the Company of this Agreement including a reduction in Executive s Base Salary or target annual bonus opportunity
or a material reduction in Executive s employee benefits in the aggregate under this Agreement, (ii) a material reduction
or diminution of Executive s duties, authority or responsibilities (including any change in his reporting requirements),
or (iii) a material change in Executive s principal place of employment to a location more than 25 miles outside of Las
Vegas, Nevada. Notwithstanding the above, the occurrence of any of the events described in (i), (ii) or (iii) above will not constitute
a  Good Reason  unless Executive gives Parent written notice, within sixty (60) calendar days after the occurrence
of any such events that such circumstances constitute  Good Reason,  and Parent or the Company thereafter fails to
cure such circumstances within 30 days after receipt of such notice. The termination of the Employment Period for Cause shall
preclude Executive s resignation with Good Reason.  

(i)          
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the severance benefits contemplated by this Agreement, nor will any Earnings that
Executive may receive from any other source reduce any such severance benefits.  

5.                 
 Confidential Information .  

(a)         
Executive acknowledges that the continued success of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries and affiliates, depends upon the
use and protection of a large body of confidential and proprietary information. All of such confidential and proprietary information
now existing or to be developed in the future will be referred to in this Agreement as   Confidential Information . 
Confidential Information will be interpreted as broadly as possible to include all information of any sort (whether merely remembered
or embodied in a tangible or intangible form) that is (i) related to Parent s, the Company s or their Subsidiaries 
or affiliates  current or potential business, and (ii) is not generally or publicly known. Confidential Information
includes, without specific limitation, the information, observations and data obtained by him whether before or after the date
of this Agreement concerning the business and affairs of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries and affiliates, information
concerning acquisition opportunities in or reasonably related to Parent, the Company s or their Subsidiaries  or affiliates 
business or industry of which Executive becomes aware, the persons or entities that are current, former or prospective business
relations, as well as development, transition and transformation plans, methodologies and methods of doing business, strategic,
marketing and expansion plans, including plans regarding planned and potential sales, financial and business plans, employee lists
and telephone numbers, locations of sales agents, new and existing programs and services, prices and terms, merchant service,
integration processes, requirements and costs of providing service, support and equipment. Therefore, Executive agrees that he
shall not disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his own account any of such Confidential Information without the Board s
prior written consent, unless and to the extent that any Confidential Information (i) becomes generally known to and available
for use by the public other than as a result of Executive s acts or omissions to act, or (ii) is required to be disclosed
pursuant to any applicable law or court order. Executive agrees to deliver to Parent at the end of the Employment Period, or at

Subsidiaries or affiliates, or (iii) in the case of materials, property or information belonging to any former employer or
other person to whom Executive has an obligation of confidentiality, approved for such use in writing by such former employer
or person. If at any time during employment with Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary, Executive believes he is being asked to
engage in work that will, or will be likely to, jeopardize any confidentiality or other obligations Executive may have to former
employers or other persons, Executive shall immediately advise the Board so that Executive s duties can be modified appropriately.  

(c)          Executive shall immediately notify the Board of any intended or unintended, unauthorized disclosure or use of any trade secrets

 above, Executive will hold Third Party Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose to anyone (other than
personnel of Parent, the Company or their Subsidiaries and affiliates who need to know such information in connection with their
work for Parent, the Company or such Subsidiaries and affiliates) or use, except in connection with his work for Parent, the Company

or other examination, supply any information and execute and deliver any applications or other instruments in writing as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain and constitute such insurance. Executive hereby represents that he has no reason to believe that
his life is not insurable at rates now prevailing for healthy men of his age.

pursuant hereto shall be settled by arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before three (3) arbitrators pursuant to the National
Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the   Association  ).
Arbitration may be commenced at any time by any party hereto giving written notice to each other party to a dispute that such
dispute has been referred to arbitration under this  Section 20 . Each of the parties hereto shall select one (1) arbitrator
within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice referred to above and the third arbitrator shall be a state or federal court

(20) days after their selection by the parties hereto, the selection shall be made pursuant to the rules of, and from the panels
of arbitrators maintained by, the Association. Any award rendered by the arbitrators shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto;  provided ,  however , that any such award shall be accompanied by a written opinion of the arbitrators
giving the reasons for the award. This provision for arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and the decision
of the arbitrators in accordance herewith shall be final and binding and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom. Each party
shall pay its own expenses of arbitration and the expenses of the arbitrators shall be equally shared;  provided ,  however ,
that if in the opinion of the arbitrators any claim for indemnification or any defense or objection thereto was unreasonable,
the arbitrators may assess, as part of their award, all or any part of the arbitration expenses of the other party (including
reasonable attorneys  fees) and of the arbitrators against the party raising such unreasonable claim, defense or objection.
To the extent that arbitration may not be legally permitted hereunder and the parties to any dispute hereunder may not at the
time of such dispute mutually agree to submit such dispute to arbitration, the resolution of such dispute shall be subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this  Section 20  shall prevent the parties from settling any
dispute by mutual agreement at any time.

Agreement or the matters contemplated hereby.

 Executive s Cooperation . During the Employment Period and for one (1) year thereafter, Executive shall, subject to

appearing at the Company s request to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process, volunteering
to the Company all pertinent information and turning over to the Company all relevant documents which are or may come into Executive s

The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and
the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively   Code Section 409A  ) and, accordingly, to
the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever shall
the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or damages
for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.  

(b)        
A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for
the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation
from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references
to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.   

(c)        
Notwithstanding any other payment schedule provided herein to the contrary, if Executive is deemed on the date of termination
to be a  specified employee  within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then each of the following
shall apply:  

(i)                
With regard to any payment that is considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A payable on account of a  separation
from service,  such payment shall be made on the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period
measured from the date of such  separation from service  of Executive, and (B) the date of Executive s death
(the   Delay Period  ) to the extent required under Code Section 409A. Upon the expiration of the Delay Period,
all payments delayed pursuant to this Section (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments
in the absence of such delay) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum, and all remaining payments due under this Agreement shall
be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein; and  

(ii)              
To the extent that any benefits to be provided during the Delay Period is considered deferred compensation under Code Section
409A provided on account of a  separation from service,  and such benefits are not otherwise exempt from Code Section
409A, Executive shall pay the cost of such benefits during the Delay Period, and the Company shall reimburse Executive, to the
extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have
been provided by the Company at no cost to Executive, the Company s share of the cost of such benefits upon expiration of
the Delay Period, and any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the procedures
specified herein.  

(d)         
For purposes of Code Section 409A, Executive s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.  

(e)        
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that
constitutes  deferred compensation  for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset, counterclaim or recoupment
by any other amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.

                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and    

5.    The
                                         registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
                                         evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors
                                         and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing

(a)    All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and    

(b)    Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal controls over financial reporting.

a.     Purchase
                                         and Issuance of the Shares . Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
                                         Agreement, Investor hereby irrevocably agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company
                                         hereby agrees to sell to Investor, on the Closing Date, 190,000 shares of Common Stock

                                         On the Closing Date, upon receipt of payment therefor in accordance with this Agreement,
                                         the Company shall deliver to the Investor the Securities in book entry form through the
                                         Company s transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company s obligation
                                         to deliver the Securities and the Investor s obligation to pay the Purchase Price
                                         shall be contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the
                                         merger of FTS Holding Corporation with and into FinTech Merger Sub, Inc. (the   Merger  )
                                         set forth in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 7, 2016, as may be

                                         prior to or simultaneously with, the closing of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.    

d.     Termination .
                                         This Agreement and each of the rights and obligations of the Company and Investor shall
                                         terminate upon the termination of the Merger Agreement or by the written agreement of
                                         the parties hereto.    

e.     Tax
                                         Free Reorganization . For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that
                                         the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be integrated with the transactions contemplated
                                         by the Merger Agreement and thus be treated as part of a reorganization within the meaning
                                         of Section 368(a) of the Code (as described in Section 2.14 of the Merger Agreement).    

2.     Representations
                                         and Warranties of Investor     

Investor
represents and warrants to the Company that:  

a.     No
                                         Government Recommendation or Approval . Investor understands that no federal or state
                                         agency has passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the
                                         Offering of the Securities.    

b.     Accredited
                                         Investor  .  Investor represents that it is an  accredited investor 
                                         as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933,
                                         as amended (the   Securities Act  ), and acknowledges that the sale
                                         contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement
                                         exemption to  accredited investors  under the Securities Act and similar
                                         exemptions under state law.    

c.     Intent .
                                         Investor is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for Investor s
                                         own account and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, and not with
                                         a view to the distribution thereof and Investor has no present arrangement to sell the
                                         Securities to or through any person or entity. Investor shall not engage in hedging transactions
                                         with regard to the Securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act.    

d.     Restrictions
                                         on Transfer.  Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are being offered
                                         in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning
                                         of the Securities Act. The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
                                         and, if in the future Investor decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
                                         the Securities, such Securities may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
                                         only (A) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities
                                         Act, (B) pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 promulgated under
                                         the Securities Act, if available, or (C) pursuant to any other available exemption
                                         from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance
                                         with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
                                         the foregoing, Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are subject to transfer
                                         restrictions as described in Section 3(b) hereof. Investor agrees that, if any transfer
                                         of the Securities or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent
                                         to any such transfer Investor may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of
                                         counsel satisfactory to the Company with respect to such transfer. Absent registration
                                         or another available exemption from registration, Investor agrees it will not transfer
                                         the Securities. Investor further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell company,
                                         Rule 144 may not be available to Investor for the resale of the Securities until the
                                         one year anniversary following consummation of the Merger, despite technical compliance
                                         with the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer
                                         restrictions.    

e.     Sophisticated
                                         Investor.     

i.    FTVentures
                                         Management III, LLC, the general partner of each Investor, is sophisticated in financial
                                         matters and able to evaluate the risks and benefits of the investment in the Securities.    

ii.    Investor
                                         is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial
                                         risks because, among other things, the Securities have not been registered under the
                                         Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
                                         Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available, and Investor may
                                         suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. Investor is able
                                         to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period
                                         of time.    

f.     Independent
                                         Investigation.  Investor, in making the decision to purchase the Securities, has relied
                                         upon an independent investigation of the Company and has not relied upon any information
                                         or representations made by any third parties or upon any oral or written representations
                                         or assurances from the Company, its officers, directors or employees or any other representatives
                                         or agents of the Company, other than as set forth in this Agreement. Investor is familiar
                                         with the business, operations and financial condition of the Company and has had an opportunity
                                         to ask questions of, and receive answers from the Company s officers and directors
                                         concerning the Company and the terms and conditions of the offering of the Securities
                                         and has had full access to such other information concerning the Company as Investor
                                         has requested. Investor confirms that all documents that it has requested have been made
                                         available and that Investor has been supplied with all of the additional information
                                         concerning this investment which Investor has requested.    

g.     Organization
                                         and Authority.  Each Investor is duly organized, validly existing and in
                                         good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and it possesses all requisite
                                         power and authority necessary to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    

h.     Authority.
                                          This Agreement has been validly authorized, executed and delivered by Investor and

                                         Act requires there be no general solicitation of purchasers of the Securities. In this
                                         regard, if the Registration Statement were deemed to be a general solicitation with respect
                                         to the purchase of the Securities by Investor, the offer and sale of the Securities may
                                         not be exempt from registration and, if not, Investor may have a right to rescind its

                                         from claims that may adversely affect the Company or the interests of its stockholders,
                                         Investor hereby agrees to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any
                                         claims, right to sue or rights in law or arbitration, as the case may be, to seek rescission
                                         of its purchase of the Securities. Investor acknowledges and agrees this waiver is being
                                         made in order to induce the Company to sell the Securities to Investor. Investor agrees
                                         the foregoing waiver of rescission rights shall apply to any and all known or unknown
                                         actions, causes of action, suits, claims or proceedings against the Trust Account (collectively,
                                           Claims  ) and related losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities
                                         and damages, whether compensatory, consequential or exemplary, and expenses in connection
                                         therewith, including reasonable attorneys  and expert witness fees and disbursements
                                         and all other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
                                         any Claims, whether pending or threatened, in connection with any present or future actual
                                         or asserted right to rescind the purchase of the Securities hereunder or relating to
                                         the purchase of the Securities and the transactions contemplated hereby.    

b.    Investor
                                         agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever in connection
                                         with its purchase of the Securities or any Claim that may arise now or in the future.

                                         beneficiaries of this Section 5.     

d.    Investor
                                         agrees that, to the extent any waiver of rights under this Section 5 is ineffective as
                                         a matter of law, Investor has offered such waiver for the benefit of the Company as an
                                         equitable right that shall survive any statutory disqualification or bar that applies
                                         to a legal right. Investor acknowledges the receipt and sufficiency of consideration

                                         that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature

                                         data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing
                                         (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect without said provision; provided that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 no such severability shall be effective if it materially changes the economic benefit of this Agreement to any

NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Investor hereby agree as follows:  

1.     Purchase
                                         of Securities     

a.     Purchase
                                         and Issuance of the Shares . Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
                                         Agreement, Investor hereby irrevocably agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company
                                         hereby agrees to sell to Investor, on the Closing Date, 100,000 shares of Common Stock

                                         On the Closing Date, upon receipt of payment therefor in accordance with this Agreement,
                                         the Company shall deliver to the Investor the Securities in book entry form through the
                                         Company s transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company s obligation
                                         to deliver the Securities and the Investor s obligation to pay the Purchase Price
                                         shall be contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the
                                         merger of FTS Holding Corporation with and into FinTech Merger Sub, Inc. (the   Merger  )

                                         acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Purchase Price may be settled by deducting
                                         the amount of the Purchase Price from the cash consideration payable to Investor pursuant

a.     No
                                         Government Recommendation or Approval . Investor understands that no federal or state
                                         agency has passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the
                                         Offering of the Securities.    

b.     Accredited
                                         Investor  .  Investor represents that it is an  accredited investor 
                                         as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933,
                                         as amended (the   Securities Act  ), and acknowledges that the sale
                                         contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement
                                         exemption to  accredited investors  under the Securities Act and similar
                                         exemptions under state law.    

c.     Intent .
                                         Investor is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for Investor s
                                         own account and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, and not with
                                         a view to the distribution thereof and Investor has no present arrangement to sell the
                                         Securities to or through any person or entity. Investor shall not engage in hedging transactions
                                         with regard to the Securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act.    

d.     Restrictions

                                         and, if in the future Investor decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
                                         the Securities, such Securities may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
                                         only (A) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities
                                         Act, (B) pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 promulgated under
                                         the Securities Act, if available, or (C) pursuant to any other available exemption
                                         from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance
                                         with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
                                         the foregoing, Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are subject to transfer
                                         restrictions as described in Section 3(b) hereof. Investor agrees that, if any transfer
                                         of the Securities or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent
                                         to any such transfer Investor may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of
                                         counsel satisfactory to the Company with respect to such transfer. Absent registration
                                         or another available exemption from registration, Investor agrees it will not transfer
                                         the Securities. Investor further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell company,
                                         Rule 144 may not be available to Investor for the resale of the Securities until the
                                         one year anniversary following consummation of the Merger, despite technical compliance
                                         with the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer
                                         restrictions.    

e.     Sophisticated
                                         Investor.     

i.    The
                                         Investor, is sophisticated in financial matters and able to evaluate the risks and benefits
                                         of the investment in the Securities.    

ii.    Investor
                                         is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial
                                         risks because, among other things, the Securities have not been registered under the
                                         Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
                                         Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available, and Investor may
                                         suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. Investor is able
                                         to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period
                                         of time.    

f.     Independent
                                         Investigation.  Investor, in making the decision to purchase the Securities, has relied
                                         upon an independent investigation of the Company and has not relied upon any information
                                         or representations made by any third parties or upon any oral or written representations
                                         or assurances from the Company, its officers, directors or employees or any other representatives
                                         or agents of the Company, other than as set forth in this Agreement. Investor is familiar
                                         with the business, operations and financial condition of the Company and has had an opportunity
                                         to ask questions of, and receive answers from the Company s officers and directors
                                         concerning the Company and the terms and conditions of the offering of the Securities
                                         and has had full access to such other information concerning the Company as Investor
                                         has requested. Investor confirms that all documents that it has requested have been made
                                         available and that Investor has been supplied with all of the additional information
                                         concerning this investment which Investor has requested.

                                         Right Waiver and Indemnification.     

a.    Investor
                                         understands and acknowledges an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
                                         Act requires there be no general solicitation of purchasers of the Securities. In this
                                         regard, if the Registration Statement were deemed to be a general solicitation with respect
                                         to the purchase of the Securities by Investor, the offer and sale of the Securities may
                                         not be exempt from registration and, if not, Investor may have a right to rescind its
                                         purchase of the Securities. In order to facilitate the completion of the Offering and
                                         in order to protect the Company, its stockholders and the amounts in the Trust Account
                                         from claims that may adversely affect the Company or the interests of its stockholders,
                                         Investor hereby agrees to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any
                                         claims, right to sue or rights in law or arbitration, as the case may be, to seek rescission
                                         of its purchase of the Securities. Investor acknowledges and agrees this waiver is being
                                         made in order to induce the Company to sell the Securities to Investor. Investor agrees
                                         the foregoing waiver of rescission rights shall apply to any and all known or unknown
                                         actions, causes of action, suits, claims or proceedings against the Trust Account (collectively,
                                           Claims  ) and related losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities
                                         and damages, whether compensatory, consequential or exemplary, and expenses in connection
                                         therewith, including reasonable attorneys  and expert witness fees and disbursements
                                         and all other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
                                         any Claims, whether pending or threatened, in connection with any present or future actual
                                         or asserted right to rescind the purchase of the Securities hereunder or relating to
                                         the purchase of the Securities and the transactions contemplated hereby.    

b.    Investor
                                         agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever in connection
                                         with its purchase of the Securities or any Claim that may arise now or in the future.    

c.    Investor
                                         acknowledges and agrees that the stockholders of the Company are and shall be third-party
                                         beneficiaries of this Section 5.     

d.    Investor
                                         agrees that, to the extent any waiver of rights under this Section 5 is ineffective as
                                         a matter of law, Investor has offered such waiver for the benefit of the Company as an
                                         equitable right that shall survive any statutory disqualification or bar that applies
                                         to a legal right. Investor acknowledges the receipt and sufficiency of consideration
                                         received from the Company hereunder in this regard.

by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to a jury trial

                                         Agreement, Investor hereby irrevocably agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company
                                         hereby agrees to sell to Investor, on the Closing Date, 30,000 shares of Common Stock

a.     No
                                         Government Recommendation or Approval . Investor understands that no federal or state
                                         agency has passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the
                                         Offering of the Securities.    

b.     Accredited
                                         Investor  .  Investor represents that it is an  accredited investor 
                                         as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933,
                                         as amended (the   Securities Act  ), and acknowledges that the sale
                                         contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement
                                         exemption to  accredited investors  under the Securities Act and similar
                                         exemptions under state law.    

c.     Intent .
                                         Investor is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for Investor s
                                         own account and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, and not with
                                         a view to the distribution thereof and Investor has no present arrangement to sell the
                                         Securities to or through any person or entity. Investor shall not engage in hedging transactions
                                         with regard to the Securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act.    

d.     Restrictions
                                         on Transfer.  Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are being offered
                                         in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning
                                         of the Securities Act. The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
                                         and, if in the future Investor decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
                                         the Securities, such Securities may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
                                         only (A) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities
                                         Act, (B) pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 promulgated under
                                         the Securities Act, if available, or (C) pursuant to any other available exemption
                                         from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance
                                         with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
                                         the foregoing, Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are subject to transfer
                                         restrictions as described in Section 3(b) hereof. Investor agrees that, if any transfer
                                         of the Securities or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent
                                         to any such transfer Investor may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of
                                         counsel satisfactory to the Company with respect to such transfer. Absent registration
                                         or another available exemption from registration, Investor agrees it will not transfer
                                         the Securities. Investor further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell company,
                                         Rule 144 may not be available to Investor for the resale of the Securities until the
                                         one year anniversary following consummation of the Merger, despite technical compliance
                                         with the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer
                                         restrictions.    

e.     Sophisticated
                                         Investor.     

i.    The
                                         Investor, is sophisticated in financial matters and able to evaluate the risks and benefits
                                         of the investment in the Securities.    

ii.    Investor
                                         is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial
                                         risks because, among other things, the Securities have not been registered under the
                                         Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
                                         Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available, and Investor may
                                         suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. Investor is able
                                         to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period
                                         of time.    

f.     Independent
                                         Investigation.  Investor, in making the decision to purchase the Securities, has relied
                                         upon an independent investigation of the Company and has not relied upon any information
                                         or representations made by any third parties or upon any oral or written representations
                                         or assurances from the Company, its officers, directors or employees or any other representatives
                                         or agents of the Company, other than as set forth in this Agreement. Investor is familiar
                                         with the business, operations and financial condition of the Company and has had an opportunity
                                         to ask questions of, and receive answers from the Company s officers and directors
                                         concerning the Company and the terms
and conditions of the offering of the Securities and has had full access to such other information concerning the Company as Investor
has requested. Investor confirms that all documents that it has requested have been made available and that Investor has been
supplied with all of the additional information concerning this investment which Investor has requested.    

g.     Organization
                                         and Authority.  Each Investor is duly organized, validly existing and in
                                         good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and it possesses all requisite

h.     Authority.
                                          This Agreement has been validly authorized, executed and delivered by Investor and
                                         is a valid and binding agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
                                         such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
                                         moratorium, reorganization, or similar laws relating to, or affecting generally the enforcement

                                         and except as enforcement of rights to indemnity and contribution may be limited by federal
                                         and state securities laws or principles of public policy.    

i.     No
                                         Conflicts . The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation
                                         by Investor of the transactions contemplated hereby do not violate, conflict with or
                                         constitute a default under (i) Investor's charter documents, (ii) any agreement
                                         or instrument to which Investor is a party or (iii) any law, statute, rule or regulation
                                         to which Investor is subject, or any agreement, order, judgment or decree to which Investor
                                         is subject.

5.     Rescission
                                         Right Waiver and Indemnification.     

a.    Investor
                                         understands and acknowledges an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
                                         Act requires there be no general solicitation of purchasers of the Securities. In this
                                         regard, if the Registration Statement were deemed to be a general solicitation with respect
                                         to the purchase of the Securities by Investor, the offer and sale of the Securities may
                                         not be exempt from registration and, if not, Investor may have a right to rescind its
                                         purchase of the Securities. In order to facilitate the completion of the Offering and
                                         in order to protect the Company, its stockholders and the amounts in the Trust Account
                                         from claims that may adversely affect the Company or the interests of its stockholders,
                                         Investor hereby agrees to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any
                                         claims, right to sue or rights in law or arbitration, as the case may be, to seek rescission
                                         of its purchase of the Securities. Investor acknowledges and agrees this waiver is being
                                         made in order to induce the Company to sell the Securities to Investor. Investor agrees
                                         the foregoing waiver of rescission rights shall apply to any and all known or unknown
                                         actions, causes of action, suits, claims or proceedings against the Trust Account (collectively,
                                           Claims  ) and related losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities
                                         and damages, whether compensatory, consequential or exemplary, and expenses in connection
                                         therewith, including reasonable attorneys  and expert witness fees and disbursements
                                         and all other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
                                         any Claims, whether pending or threatened, in connection with any present or future actual
                                         or asserted right to rescind the purchase of the Securities hereunder or relating to
                                         the purchase of the Securities and the transactions contemplated hereby.    

b.    Investor
                                         agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever in connection
                                         with its purchase of the Securities or any Claim that may arise now or in the future.

                                         beneficiaries of this Section 5.     

d.    Investor
                                         agrees that, to the extent any waiver of rights under this Section 5 is ineffective as
                                         a matter of law, Investor has offered such waiver for the benefit of the Company as an
                                         equitable right that shall survive any statutory disqualification or bar that applies
                                         to a legal right. Investor acknowledges the receipt and sufficiency of consideration
                                         received from the Company hereunder in this regard.

Notwithstanding
the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties hereto, the parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to a jury trial
in connection with any litigation pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Investor hereby agree as follows:  

1.     Purchase
                                         of Securities     

a.     Purchase
                                         and Issuance of the Shares . Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
                                         Agreement, Investor hereby irrevocably agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company
                                         hereby agrees to sell to Investor, on the Closing Date, 30,000 shares of Common Stock
                                         for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000 (the   Purchase Price  ).
                                         On the Closing Date, upon receipt of payment therefor in accordance with this Agreement,
                                         the Company shall deliver to the Investor the Securities in book entry form through the
                                         Company s transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company s obligation
                                         to deliver the Securities and the Investor s obligation to pay the Purchase Price
                                         shall be contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the
                                         merger of FTS Holding Corporation with and into FinTech Merger Sub, Inc. (the   Merger  )

                                         acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Purchase Price may be settled by deducting
                                         the amount of the Purchase Price from the cash consideration payable to Investor pursuant

represents and warrants to the Company that:  

a.     No
                                         Government Recommendation or Approval . Investor understands that no federal or state
                                         agency has passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the
                                         Offering of the Securities.    

b.     Accredited
                                         Investor  .  Investor represents that it is an  accredited investor 
                                         as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933,
                                         as amended (the   Securities Act  ), and acknowledges that the sale
                                         contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement
                                         exemption to  accredited investors  under the Securities Act and similar
                                         exemptions under state law.    

c.     Intent .
                                         Investor is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for Investor s
                                         own account and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, and not with
                                         a view to the distribution thereof and Investor has no present arrangement to sell the
                                         Securities to or through any person or entity. Investor shall not engage in hedging transactions
                                         with regard to the Securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act.    

d.     Restrictions
                                         on Transfer.  Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are being offered
                                         in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning
                                         of the Securities Act. The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
                                         and, if in the future Investor decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
                                         the Securities, such Securities may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
                                         only (A) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities
                                         Act, (B) pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 promulgated under
                                         the Securities Act, if available, or (C) pursuant to any other available exemption
                                         from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance
                                         with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
                                         the foregoing, Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are subject to transfer
                                         restrictions as described in Section 3(b) hereof. Investor agrees that, if any transfer
                                         of the Securities or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent
                                         to any such transfer Investor may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of
                                         counsel satisfactory to the Company with respect to such transfer. Absent registration
                                         or another available exemption from registration, Investor agrees it will not transfer
                                         the Securities. Investor further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell company,
                                         Rule 144 may not be available to Investor for the resale of the Securities until the
                                         one year anniversary following consummation of the Merger, despite technical compliance
                                         with the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer
                                         restrictions.    

e.     Sophisticated
                                         Investor.     

i.    The
                                         Investor, is sophisticated in financial matters and able to evaluate the risks and benefits
                                         of the investment in the Securities.    

ii.    Investor
                                         is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial
                                         risks because, among other things, the Securities have not been registered under the
                                         Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
                                         Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available, and Investor may
                                         suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. Investor is able
                                         to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period
                                         of time.    

f.     Independent

                                         exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and (iii) in compliance
                                         herewith and with the Letter Agreement.    

d.     Registration
                                         Rights.  Investor will be entitled to certain registration rights with respect to
                                         the Securities which will be governed by the registration rights agreement between, among
                                         others, Investor and the Company, to be entered into in connection with the Merger and
                                         to be dated as of the Closing Date.     

5.     Rescission
                                         Right Waiver and Indemnification.     

a.    Investor
                                         understands and acknowledges an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
                                         Act requires there be no general solicitation of purchasers of the Securities. In this
                                         regard, if the Registration Statement were deemed to be a general solicitation with respect
                                         to the purchase of the Securities by Investor, the offer and sale of the Securities may
                                         not be exempt from registration and, if not, Investor may have a right to rescind its
                                         purchase of the Securities. In order to facilitate the completion of the Offering and
                                         in order to protect the Company, its stockholders and the amounts in the Trust Account
                                         from claims that may adversely affect the Company or the interests of its stockholders,
                                         Investor hereby agrees to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any
                                         claims, right to sue or rights in law or arbitration, as the case may be, to seek rescission
                                         of its purchase of the Securities. Investor acknowledges and agrees this waiver is being
                                         made in order to induce the Company to sell the Securities to Investor. Investor agrees
                                         the foregoing waiver of rescission rights shall apply to any and all known or unknown
                                         actions, causes of action, suits, claims or proceedings against the Trust Account (collectively,
                                           Claims  ) and related losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities
                                         and damages, whether compensatory, consequential or exemplary, and expenses in connection
                                         therewith, including reasonable attorneys  and expert witness fees and disbursements
                                         and all other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
                                         any Claims, whether pending or threatened, in connection with any present or future actual
                                         or asserted right to rescind the purchase of the Securities hereunder or relating to
                                         the purchase of the Securities and the transactions contemplated hereby.    

b.    Investor
                                         agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever in connection
                                         with its purchase of the Securities or any Claim that may arise now or in the future.    

c.    Investor
                                         acknowledges and agrees that the stockholders of the Company are and shall be third-party
                                         beneficiaries of this Section 5.     

d.    Investor
                                         agrees that, to the extent any waiver of rights under this Section 5 is ineffective as
                                         a matter of law, Investor has offered such waiver for the benefit of the Company as an
                                         equitable right that shall survive any statutory disqualification or bar that applies
                                         to a legal right. Investor acknowledges the receipt and sufficiency of consideration
                                         received from the Company hereunder in this regard.    

6.     Governing
                                         Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial     

Notwithstanding
the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties hereto, the parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to a jury trial
in connection with any litigation pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                         (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect without said provision; provided that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 no such severability shall be effective if it materially changes the economic benefit of this Agreement to any
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 party.

                                         Government Recommendation or Approval . Investor understands that no federal or state
                                         agency has passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Company or the
                                         Offering of the Securities.    

b.     Accredited
                                         Investor  .  Investor represents that it is an  accredited investor 
                                         as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933,
                                         as amended (the   Securities Act  ), and acknowledges that the sale
                                         contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement
                                         exemption to  accredited investors  under the Securities Act and similar
                                         exemptions under state law.    

c.     Intent .
                                         Investor is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for Investor s
                                         own account and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, and not with
                                         a view to the distribution thereof and Investor has no present arrangement to sell the
                                         Securities to or through any person or entity. Investor shall not engage in hedging transactions
                                         with regard to the Securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act.    

d.     Restrictions
                                         on Transfer.  Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are being offered
                                         in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning
                                         of the Securities Act. The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
                                         and, if in the future Investor decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
                                         the Securities, such Securities may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
                                         only (A) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities
                                         Act, (B) pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 promulgated under
                                         the Securities Act, if available, or (C) pursuant to any other available exemption
                                         from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance
                                         with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
                                         the foregoing, Investor acknowledges and understands the Securities are subject to transfer
                                         restrictions as described in Section 3(b) hereof. Investor agrees that, if any transfer
                                         of the Securities or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent
                                         to any such transfer Investor may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of
                                         counsel satisfactory to the Company with respect to such transfer. Absent registration
                                         or another available exemption from registration, Investor agrees it will not transfer
                                         the Securities. Investor further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell company,
                                         Rule 144 may not be available to Investor for the resale of the Securities until the
                                         one year anniversary following consummation of the Merger, despite technical compliance
                                         with the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer
                                         restrictions.    

e.     Sophisticated

                                         of the investment in the Securities.    

ii.    Investor
                                         is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial
                                         risks because, among other things, the Securities have not been registered under the
                                         Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
                                         Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available, and Investor may
                                         suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. Investor is able
                                         to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period
                                         of time.    

f.     Independent

                                         upon an independent investigation of the Company and has not relied upon any information
                                         or representations made by any third parties or upon any oral or written representations
                                         or assurances from the Company, its officers, directors or employees or any other representatives
                                         or agents of the Company, other than as set forth in this Agreement. Investor is familiar
                                         with the business, operations and financial condition of the Company and has had an opportunity
                                         to ask questions of, and receive answers from the Company s officers and directors
                                         concerning the Company and the terms and conditions of the offering of the Securities
                                         and has had full access to such other information concerning the Company as Investor
                                         has requested. Investor confirms that all documents that it has requested have been made
                                         available and that Investor has been supplied with all of the additional information
                                         concerning this investment which Investor has requested.

5.     Rescission
                                         Right Waiver and Indemnification.     

a.    Investor
                                         understands and acknowledges an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
                                         Act requires there be no general solicitation of purchasers of the Securities. In this
                                         regard, if the Registration Statement were deemed to be a general solicitation with respect
                                         to the purchase of the Securities by Investor, the offer and sale of the Securities may
                                         not be exempt from registration and, if not, Investor may have a right to rescind its
                                         purchase of the Securities. In order to facilitate the completion of the Offering and
                                         in order to protect the Company, its stockholders and the amounts in the Trust Account
                                         from claims that may adversely affect the Company or the interests of its stockholders,
                                         Investor hereby agrees to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any
                                         claims, right to sue or rights in law or arbitration, as the case may be, to seek rescission
                                         of its purchase of the Securities. Investor acknowledges and agrees this waiver is being
                                         made in order to induce the Company to sell the Securities to Investor. Investor agrees
                                         the foregoing waiver of rescission rights shall apply to any and all known or unknown
                                         actions, causes of action, suits, claims or proceedings against the Trust Account (collectively,
                                           Claims  ) and related losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities
                                         and damages, whether compensatory, consequential or exemplary, and expenses in connection
                                         therewith, including reasonable attorneys  and expert witness fees and disbursements
                                         and all other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
                                         any Claims, whether pending or threatened, in connection with any present or future actual
                                         or asserted right to rescind the purchase of the Securities hereunder or relating to
                                         the purchase of the Securities and the transactions contemplated hereby.    

b.    Investor
                                         agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever in connection
                                         with its purchase of the Securities or any Claim that may arise now or in the future.    

c.    Investor
                                         acknowledges and agrees that the stockholders of the Company are and shall be third-party
                                         beneficiaries of this Section 5.     

d.    Investor
                                         agrees that, to the extent any waiver of rights under this Section 5 is ineffective as
                                         a matter of law, Investor has offered such waiver for the benefit of the Company as an
                                         equitable right that shall survive any statutory disqualification or bar that applies
                                         to a legal right. Investor acknowledges the receipt and sufficiency of consideration
                                         received from the Company hereunder in this regard.    

6.     Governing
                                         Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial     

Notwithstanding
the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties hereto, the parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to a jury trial
in connection with any litigation pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                         the parties as to the subject matter thereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions,

                                         signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, waiver, discharge
                                         or termination is sought.

                                         upon Successors.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of

                                         to have been received when delivered personally, on the scheduled arrival date when sent
                                         by next day or 2nd-day courier service, or if sent by facsimile upon receipt of confirmation

9.     Counterparts .
                                         This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which when taken together
                                         shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts
                                         have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood
                                         that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature
                                         is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a  pdf  format
                                         data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing
                                         (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if
                                         such facsimile or  .pdf  signature page were an original thereof.

a.     Survival.
                                          The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto shall
                                         survive the Closing.    

b.     Severability.
                                          In the event that any provision of this Agreement becomes or is declared by a court
                                         of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall
                                         continue in full force and effect without said provision; provided that no such severability
                                         shall be effective if it materially changes the economic benefit of this Agreement to
                                         any party.
