GLADSTONE LAND CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   
  NOTE 1.  BUSINESS 
  Business 
  Gladstone Land Corporation is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that was re-incorporated in Maryland on   March 24, 2011  , having been previously re-incorporated in Delaware on   May 25, 2004  , and having been originally incorporated in California on   June 14, 1997  .  We are primarily in the business of owning and leasing farmland, and we conduct substantially all of our operations through a subsidiary, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership.  The Company owned   89.2%   and   100.0%   of the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership ("OP Units") as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively (see Note 7, "Equity," for additional discussion regarding OP Units). 
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and pursuant to contractual agreements, our business is managed by Gladstone Management Corporation (the  Adviser ), a Delaware corporation, and administrative services are provided to us by Gladstone Administration, LLC (the  Administrator ), a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser and Administrator are both affiliates of ours. 
  All further references herein to  we,   us,   our  and the  Company  refer, collectively, to Gladstone Land Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where indicated otherwise. 
   
  NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Interim Financial Information 
  Our interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted.  In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period have been included.  The interim financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on February 23, 2016 (the  Form 10-K ).  The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or for the full fiscal year. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain line items on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , and the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on previously-reported stockholders  equity or net income. 
  Non-controlling Interests 
  Non-controlling interests are interests in the Operating Partnership not owned by us. We evaluate whether non-controlling interests are subject to redemption features outside of our control.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the non-controlling interests in the Operating Partnership are redeemable for cash or, at our option, shares of our common stock and thus are reported in the equity section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet but separate from stockholders  equity.  The amount reported for non-controlling interests on the Condensed Statement of Operations represents the portion of income from the Operating Partnership not attributable to us.

     Table of Contents  

Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions, and the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties.  A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K.  There were no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs.  ASU 2015-03 requires the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred financing cost.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and we adopted this provision during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  As of both   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had unamortized deferred financing costs related to mortgage notes and bonds payable of approximately   $1.1 million  , which costs have been reclassified from Deferred financing costs, net, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , in the Form 10-K, to Mortgage notes and bonds payable, net on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  All periods presented have been retroactively adjusted. 
  The following table summarizes the retrospective adjustment and the overall impact on the previously-reported consolidated financial statements:   

(1)   
    Included as part of Deferred financing costs, net, as reported on the   Consolidated Balance Sheet   in the Form 10-K. 
     In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ), which codifies an SEC staff announcement that entities are permitted to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements as assets.  ASU 2015-15 was effective immediately.  As of each   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately   $0.1 million   related to our line of credit, and we will continue to present debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements as an asset on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted accounting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810,  Consolidations: Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities,  ( ASC 810 ), which modifies the analysis we must perform to determine whether we should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest model entities, but it modifies the requirements to qualify as a voting interest model entity.  Under the revised guidance, our Operating Partnership will qualify as a VIE; however, as we already consolidate the Operating Partnership in our balance sheets, the identification of our Operating Partnership as a VIE has no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of this guidance.  In addition, there were no other voting interest model entities under prior existing guidance determined to be VIEs under the revised guidance. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842): An Amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  ( ASU 2016-02 ).  The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the leases is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee, which classification determines whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis, respectively, over the term of the lease.  A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months, regardless of the classification.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases.  The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.  ASU 2016-02 supersedes the previous leasing standard, ASC 840,  Leases,  and is effective on January 1, 2019, with  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the overall impact of ASU 2016-02.  We expect our legal expenses to increase marginally, as the new standard requires us to expense indirect leasing costs that were previously capitalized; however, we do not expect ASU 2016-02 to materially impact our consolidated financial statements, as we do not currently have any lease arrangements for which we are the lessee. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)" ("ASU 2016-15"), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-15 and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control" ("ASU 2016-17"), which amends the consolidation guidance in ASU 2015-02 regarding the treatment of indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control.  ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-17 and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Real Estate 
  The following table sets forth the components of our investments in tangible real estate assets as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  : 

Real estate depreciation expense on these tangible assets was   $1,224,612   and   $3,161,434   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $595,539   and   $1,647,177   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Included in the figures above are amounts related to improvements on certain of our properties paid for by our tenants but owned by us, or tenant improvements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded tenant improvements, net of accumulated depreciation, of   $1,882,114   and   $1,302,009  , respectively.  We recorded both depreciation expense and additional rental revenue related to these tenant improvements of   $30,753   and   $98,225   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $14,780   and   $27,502   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Intangible Assets and Liabilities 
  The following table summarizes the carrying values of lease intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  : 

Total amortization expense related to these lease intangible assets was   $207,234   and   $582,095   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $193,621   and   $645,448   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following table summarizes the carrying values of certain lease intangible assets or liabilities included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related accumulated amortization or accretion, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1)   
    Above-market lease values are included as part of Other assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related amortization is recorded as a reduction of rental income.

     Table of Contents  

(2)   
    Below-market lease values and deferred revenue are included as a part of Other liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related accretion is recorded as an increase to rental income. 
     Total amortization related to above-market lease values and deferred revenue was   $1,627   and   $4,882   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $4,496   and   $15,286   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Total accretion related to below-market lease values and deferred revenue was   $8,951   and   $23,613   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $52,591   and   $160,324   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  New Real Estate Activity 
  Certain acquisitions during the periods presented were accounted for as business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, as there was a prior leasing history on the property.  As such, the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined in accordance with ASC 805, and all acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred, other than those costs directly related to reviewing or assigning leases that we assumed upon acquisition, which were capitalized as part of leasing costs.  For acquisitions accounted for as asset acquisitions under ASC 360, all acquisition-related costs were capitalized and included as part of the fair value allocation of the identifiable tangible assets acquired, other than those costs that directly related to originating new leases we executed upon acquisition, which were capitalized as part of leasing costs. 
  In addition, total consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities, such as OP Units.  When OP Units are issued in connection with acquisitions, we determine the fair value of the OP Units issued based on the number of units issued multiplied by the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of acquisition. 
  2016 New Real Estate Activity 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   13   new farms in   seven   separate transactions, which are summarized in the table below. 

(1)   
    Annualized straight-line amount is based on the minimum cash rental payments guaranteed under the lease, as required under GAAP. 
               (2)   
    As partial consideration for the acquisition of this property, we issued   745,879   OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately   $6.5 million   as of the acquisition date.  We incurred   $25,500   of legal costs in connection with the issuance of these OP Units. 
               (3)   
    Acquisition accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805.  In aggregate,   $9,520   of these costs related to direct leasing costs incurred in connection with these acquisitions. 
               (4)   
    Acquisition accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 360. 
               (5)   
    Lease provides for a variable rent component based on the gross crop revenues earned on the property.  The figure above represents only the minimum cash rents guaranteed under the lease. 
               (6)   
    As partial consideration for the acquisition of this property, we issued   125,677   OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately   $1.5 million   as of the acquisition date.  We incurred approximately   $8,235   of legal costs in connection with the issuance of these OP Units. 
               (7)   
    As partial consideration for the acquisition of this property, we issued   343,750   OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately   $3.9 million   as of the acquisition date.  We incurred approximately   $21,732   of legal costs in connection with the issuance of these OP Units.

Pro-Forma Financials 
  During each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we acquired   six   farms in transactions that qualified as business combinations.  The following table reflects pro-forma consolidated financial information as if each farm acquired as part of a business combination was acquired on January 1 of the respective prior fiscal year.  In addition, pro-forma earnings have been adjusted to assume that acquisition-related costs related to these farms were incurred at the beginning of the previous fiscal year. 

The pro-forma consolidated results are prepared for informational purposes only.  They are not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated financial condition or results of operations actually would have been assuming the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the respective previous periods, nor do they purport to represent our consolidated financial position or results of operations for future periods. 
  Significant Existing Real Estate Activity 
  On February 1, 2016, we completed certain irrigation improvements on Sycamore Road to increase overall water availability at a total cost of   $993,319  .  As stipulated in the lease agreement with our tenant, we will earn additional rent on the total cost commensurate with the annual yield on the farmland, which will result in additional straight-line rental income of   $53,550   per year throughout the remaining lease term. 
    
  On February 8, 2016, we renewed the lease with the tenant occupying one of our McIntosh Road farms, which was set to expire on June 30, 2016.  The lease was renewed for an additional   three years  , through   June 30, 2019  , with annualized, straight-line rental income of   $63,000  , representing a   17.9%   increase over that of the previous lease. 
    
  On April 5, 2016, we reimbursed the tenant occupying Wauchula Road for   $569,607   of costs incurred to construct certain irrigation improvements on the farm.  As stipulated in the lease, as of April 1, 2016, we began earning an additional   $92,634   of annualized, straight-line rental income on this farm throughout the remaining lease term. 
    
  On April 5, 2016, we reimbursed the tenant occupying Parrish Road for   $500,000   of our portion of the costs incurred to construct certain irrigation improvements on the farm.  As stipulated in the lease, as of April 1, 2016, we began earning an additional   $139,073   of annualized, straight-line rental income on this farm throughout the remaining lease term.  In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Parrish Road in March 2015, we committed to providing   $745,000   as additional compensation and reimbursements of certain costs, contingent upon the approval by a local water management district of increases in certain water permits on the property.  These water permits were approved on June 28, 2016, and we remitted   $745,000   to the tenant, who was also the seller of the property, on June 30, 2016. 
    
  On July 5, 2016, we received payment of approximately   $164,000   (including   $4,000   of accrued interest) from the California Department of Transportation ("CalTrans") in connection with the settlement of the eminent domain lawsuit for   4.5   acres of nonfarmable land on Espinosa Road.  The portion of this payment allocated to our cost basis of the   4.5   nonfarmable acres was approximately   $156,000  , which was previously included in Investments in real estate, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  On July 15, 2016, we terminated the lease with the tenant occupying Colding Loop prior to its expiration, and, on August 5, 2016, we entered into a new lease with a new tenant to occupy the property.  The new lease is scheduled to expire on August 4, 2017, and provides for minimum rental payments of   $72,400   over its term.  In connection with the early termination of the previous lease, we wrote off   $20,697   and   $84,600   of deferred rent asset balances to bad debt expense during the   three and nine

months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed   $8,635   of unamortized leasing costs associated with the previous lease. 
    
  On August 25, 2016, we renewed the lease with the tenant occupying Espinosa Road, which was originally set to expire on October 31, 2016.  The lease was renewed for an additional   four years  , through   October 31, 2020  , with annualized, straight-line rental income of   $997,017  , representing a   28.1%   increase over that of the previous lease.  In connection with the renewal, we also assumed the responsibility for the property taxes on Espinosa Road, which were the tenant's responsibility under the old lease.  Property taxes on Espinosa Road are approximately   $144,000   for the property tax assessment year ending June 30, 2017. 
  Portfolio Diversification and Concentrations

  The following table summarizes the geographic locations, by state, of our properties with leases in place as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Concentrations 
  Credit Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our farms were leased to   39   different, third-party tenants, with certain tenants leasing more than one farm. Dole Food Company ( Dole ) leases   two   of our farms, and aggregate rental revenue attributable to Dole accounted for approximately   $2.2 million  , or   17.8%   of the rental revenue recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  If Dole fails to make rental payments or elects to terminate its leases, and the properties cannot be re-leased on satisfactory terms, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  No other individual tenant represented greater than   10.0%   of the total rental revenue recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Geographic Risk 
  21   of our   56   farms owned as of   September 30, 2016  , are located in California, and   15   farms are located in Florida.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our farmland in California accounted for   6,516   acres, or   19.3%   of the total acreage we owned.  Furthermore, these farms accounted for approximately   $7.0 million  , or   56.4%   of the rental revenue recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  However, these farms are spread across   three   of the many different growing regions within California.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our farmland in Florida accounted for   5,567   acres, or   16.5%   of the total acreage we owned, and these farms accounted for approximately   $2.4 million  , or   19.4%  , of the rental revenue recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster occur where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  No other single state accounted for more than   10.0%   of the total rental revenue recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 4.  BORROWINGS 
  Our borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are summarized below: 

(2)   
    The MetLife Facility (as defined below) was amended subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  See Note 10, "Subsequent Events," for further discussion on the amendment. 
               (3)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , if the facility was not fully utilized by   December 31, 2017  , MetLife had the option to be relieved of its obligations to disburse the additional funds under the loan.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , our ability to draw under this facility was extended to   December 31, 2018  .  See Note 10, "Subsequent Events," for further discussion. 
               (4)   
    Based on the properties that were pledged as collateral under the MetLife Facility, as of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum additional amount we could draw under the facility was approximately   $0.6 million  .  Our availability under this facility was increased by approximately   $28.3 million   subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  See Note 10, "Subsequent Events," for further discussion. 
               (5)   
    Includes borrowings from Farm Credit CFL and Farm Credit West, each as defined below. 
               (6)   
    Rate is before interest patronage.  2015 interest patronage (as described below) received resulted in a   16.1%   reduction to the stated interest rate on such borrowings. 
               (7)   
    If facility is not fully utilized by   December 11, 2018  , Farmer Mac has the option to be relieved of its obligations to purchase additional bonds under the facility. 
               (8)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   no   additional availability to draw under this facility, as   no   additional properties had been pledged as collateral. 
     The weighted-average interest rate charged on all of our borrowings, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs and before any interest patronage, or refunded interest, was   3.29%   and   3.08%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   3.41%   and   3.51%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  2015 interest patronage from all Farm Credit Notes Payable (as defined below), which patronage was received during the three months ended March 31, 2016, resulted in a   16.1%   reduction to the stated interest rates on such borrowings.  We are unable to estimate the amount of patronage to be received, if any, related to interest accrued during 2016 on our Farm Credit Notes Payable. 
  MetLife Facility 
  On May 9, 2014, we closed on a facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife ) that consists of a   $100.0 million   long-term note payable that is scheduled to mature on   January 5, 2029   (the  2015 MetLife Term Note ), and a   $25.0 million   revolving equity line of credit that is scheduled to mature on   April 5, 2024   (the  2015 MetLife Line of Credit  and, together with the 2015 MetLife Term Note, the  MetLife Facility ).  As amended on September 3, 2015, advances under the 2015 MetLife Term Note bear interest at a fixed rate of   3.35%   per annum, plus an unused line fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts, and interest rates for subsequent disbursements will be based on prevailing market rates at the time of such disbursements.  The interest rates on advances and subsequent disbursements will be subject to adjustment every   five years  , with the next interest rate adjustment date scheduled to occur on   August 31, 2020  .  If the full commitment amount of   $100.0 million   is not drawn by   December 31, 2017  , MetLife has the option to be relieved of its obligation to disburse the additional funds under this loan.  Advances under the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of   2.25%  , with a minimum annualized rate of   2.50%  , plus an unused fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts.  The interest rate spread on borrowings under the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit will be subject to adjustment on   April 5, 2017  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the MetLife Facility. 
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we amended the MetLife Facility.  See Note 10, "Subsequent Events," for further discussion of this amendment.

  Farmer Mac Facility 
  On December 5, 2014, we, through certain subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, entered into a bond purchase agreement (the  Bond Purchase Agreement ) with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac ) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation (the  Bond Purchaser ), for a secured note purchase facility that provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate principal amount of   $75.0 million   (the  Farmer Mac Facility ).  On June 16, 2016, we amended the facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from   $75.0 million   to   $125.0 million   and extend the term of the Bond Purchase Agreement by   two   years, to   December 11, 2018  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued the following bonds under the Farmer Mac Facility: 

(1)     Proceeds from this bond were used in the acquisition of Gunbarrel Road. 
            (2)   
    Proceeds from this note were used in the acquisition of Lithia Road.

Fair Value 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate fair value of our long-term, fixed-rate mortgage notes and bonds payable was approximately   $170.1 million  , as compared to an aggregate carrying value of   $167.0 million  .  The fair value of our long-term, fixed-rate mortgage notes and bonds payable is valued using Level 3 inputs under the hierarchy established by ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  and is calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using discount rates based on management s estimates of market interest rates on long-term debt with comparable terms.  Due to their short-term nature and the lack of changes in market credit spreads, the aggregate fair value of our short-term, variable-rate mortgage notes and bonds payable as of   September 30, 2016  , is deemed to approximate their aggregate carrying value of approximately   $1.9 million  .  Further, due to the revolving nature of the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit and the lack of changes in market credit spreads, its fair value as of   September 30, 2016  , is deemed to approximate its carrying value of   $22.5 million  .  
   
  NOTE 5.  MANDATORILY-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK 
  On   August 17, 2016  , we completed a public offering of   1,000,000   shares of   6.375%   Series A Cumulative Term Preferred Stock, par value   $0.001   per share (the "Term Preferred Stock"), at a public offering price of   $25.00   per share.  Simultaneous with the closing of the offering and on the same terms and conditions, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase an additional   150,000   shares of the Term Preferred Stock to cover over-allotments.  As a result of this offering, we issued a total of   1,150,000   shares of the Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately   $28.8 million   and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses borne by us, of approximately   $27.6 million  .  These proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness, to fund new property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.  The Term Preferred Stock is traded under the ticker symbol, "LANDP," on the NASDAQ Global Market.  The Term Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common stock or any other securities.   
  Generally, we may not redeem shares of the Term Preferred Stock prior to   September 30, 2018  , except in limited circumstances to preserve our qualification as a REIT.  On or after   September 30, 2018  , we may redeem the shares at a redemption price of   $25.00   per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date of redemption.  The shares of the Term Preferred Stock have a mandatory redemption date of   September 30, 2021  .  We incurred approximately   $1.2 million   in total offering costs related to this issuance, which have been recorded net of the Term Preferred Stock as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we will amortize these costs over the redemption period, which ends on   September 30, 2021  . 
  The Term Preferred Stock is recorded as a liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with ASC 480, "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity," which states that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments should be classified as liabilities.  In addition, the related dividend payments are treated as a component of interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our Term Preferred Stock was approximately   $29.7 million  , as compared to the carrying value, exclusive of offering costs, of   $28.8 million  .  The fair value of our Term Preferred Stock is valued using Level 1 inputs under the hierarchy established by ASC 820-10, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," and is calculated based on the closing share price as of September 30, 2016, of   $25.80  .

In addition,   two   of our executive officers, Mr. Gladstone and Terry Brubaker (our vice chairman and chief operating officer), serve as directors and executive officers of each of our Adviser and Administrator, and Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary, serves as our Administrator s president. 
  The current advisory agreement with our Adviser (the  Advisory Agreement ) and the current administration agreement with our Administrator (the  Administration Agreement ) became effective February 1, 2013.  A summary of each of these agreements is provided in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K.  There were no material changes to either agreement during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  NOTE 7.  EQUITY 
  Stockholders  Equity 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   18,000,000   shares of common stock, par value   $0.001   per share, authorized, with   10,024,875   shares issued and outstanding.  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   20,000,000   shares of common stock, par value   $0.001   per share, authorized, with   9,992,941   shares issued and outstanding. 
  Non-Controlling Interests in Operating Partnership 
  We consolidate our Operating Partnership, which is a majority-owned partnership.  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we owned approximately   89.2%   and   100.0%  , respectively, of the outstanding OP Units. 
  On or after 12 months after becoming a holder of OP Units, each limited partner, other than the Company, has the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such units in exchange for cash or, at the Company s option, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.    The cash redemption per OP Unit would be based on the market price of our common stock at the time of redemption.  A limited partner will not be entitled to exercise redemption rights if the delivery of common stock to the redeeming limited partner would breach restrictions on the ownership of common stock imposed under our charter and other limitations thereof. 
  Regardless of the rights described above, the Operating Partnership will not have an obligation to issue cash to a unitholder upon a redemption request if the Company elects to redeem the OP Units for shares of its common stock.  When a non-Company unitholder redeems an OP Unit, non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership is reduced, and stockholders  equity is increased. 
  The Operating Partnership is required to make distributions on each OP Unit in the same amount as those paid on each share of the Company s common stock, with the distributions on the OP Units held by the Company being utilized to make distributions to the Company s common stockholders. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   1,215,306   OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners.

The same amounts were paid as distributions on each OP Unit held by non-controlling limited partners of the Operating Partnership as of the above record dates. 
  We will provide information related to the federal income tax characterization of our 2016 distributions in an IRS Form 1099-DIV, which will be mailed to our stockholders in January 2017. 
  Registration Statement 
  We filed a universal registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-194539) with the SEC on March 13, 2014, which the SEC declared effective on April 2, 2014.  This universal registration statement permits us to issue up to an aggregate of   $300.0 million   in securities, consisting of common stock, senior common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities and depository shares, including through separate, concurrent offerings of   two   or more of such securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have issued a total of   2,188,014   shares of common stock for gross proceeds of   $23.6 million   and   1,150,000   shares of preferred stock for gross proceeds of   $28.8 million   under this universal registration statement. 
  At-the-Market Program 
  On August 7, 2015, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. and Ladenburg Thalmann   Co., Inc. (each a  Sales Agent ), under which we may issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock up to   $30.0 million   (the  ATM Program ).  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued and sold   31,934   shares of our common stock at an average sales price of   $11.29   per share under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of   $360,472   and net proceeds of   $355,057  .  Through   September 30, 2016  , we have issued and sold a total of   64,561   shares of our common stock at an average sales price of   $10.23   per share for gross proceeds of   $660,176   and net proceeds of   $650,266  .

NOTE 8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Operating Obligations 
  In connection with the lease we executed upon our acquisition of Bear Mountain in September 2015, we agreed to fund the development of the property into an almond orchard.  The development will include the removal of   274   acres of old grape vineyards, the installation of a new irrigation system, including the drilling of   three   new wells, and the planting of over   800   acres of new almond trees.  The project is estimated to cost approximately   $8.0 million   and is expected to be completed during the three months ending December 31, 2016.  As stipulated in the lease, we will earn additional rent on the total cost of the development project commensurate with the yield on the initial acquisition and based on the timing of related cash disbursement made by us.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have expended or accrued approximately   $7.9 million   related to this project; however, we are unable to estimate the total amount of additional rent to be earned related to this project at this time. 
  Litigation 
  We are not currently subject to any material known or threatened litigation. 
   
  NOTE 9.  EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.  The non-controlling limited partners  outstanding OP Units (which may be redeemed for shares of common stock) have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as there would be no effect on the amounts since the non-controlling limited partners  share of income would also be added back to net income.  Net income figures are presented net of non-controlling interests in the earnings per share calculations. 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average number of OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners was   854,116   and   613,446  , respectively.  There were   no   OP Units held by anyone other than the Company during 2015. 
   
  NOTE 10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  Investing Activity  
  On October 13, 2016, we acquired   an   almond orchard comprised of   197   acres in Fresno County, California ( Central Avenue ), for   $6.5 million  .  At closing, we executed a new   10  -year, triple-net lease with a new tenant that includes   two  ,   5  -year extension options.  The lease consists of a fixed cash rent component plus a variable rent component based on gross crop revenues earned on the property and provides for minimum annualized, straight-line cash rents of approximately   $325,000  .  We will account for this acquisition as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 360; however, the initial accounting for this transaction is not yet complete, making certain disclosures unavailable at this time. 
  Financing Activity 
  MetLife Facility 
  On October 5, 2016, we entered into an agreement with MetLife to amend the MetLife Facility.  Pursuant to the amendment, the MetLife Facility now consists of the 2015 MetLife Term Note, the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit, a   $50.0 million   long-term note payable (the "2016 MetLife Term Note") and a   $25.0 million   revolving equity line of credit (the "2016 MetLife Line of Credit"). 
  The 2016 MetLife Term Note is scheduled to mature on   January 5, 2029  , and advances will initially bear interest at a fixed rate of   3.16%   per annum, plus an unused fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts.  The interest rate for subsequent disbursements under  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

the 2016 MetLife Term Note will be based on prevailing market rates at the time of such disbursements.  The interest rate on the initial advance and any subsequent disbursements will be subject to adjustment on January 5, 2027.  If the full commitment of   $50.0 million   is not drawn by   December 31, 2018  , MetLife has the option to be relieved of its obligation to disburse the remaining funds under the 2016 MetLife Term Note. 
  The 2016 MetLife Line of Credit is scheduled to mature on   April 5, 2024  , and advances will initially bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of   2.25%  , with a minimum annualized rate of   2.50%  , plus an unused fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts.  The interest rate spread on borrowings under the 2016 MetLife Line of Credit will be subject to adjustment on   October 5, 2019  . 
  As part of the amendment, we paid aggregate loan fees of   $225,000  .  Simultaneous with the closing of the amendment, we drew approximately   $21.6 million   under the 2016 MetLife Term Note, with   $21.0 million   of the proceeds being used to repay the balance previously outstanding under the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit. 
  Among other changes, the amendment to the MetLife Facility: 
             
    increased the overall loan-to-value ratio on the underlying properties pledged as collateral under the MetLife Facility from   58%   to   60%  ; 
        All other material items of the MetLife Facility remained unchanged. 
  In addition, we updated the appraisals of certain properties that serve as collateral under the MetLife Facility, which resulted in increased overall valuations, and pledged   three   additional properties as collateral under the facility.  In conjunction with the increase in the loan-to-value ratio on the underlying collateral, these events increased our overall availability under the MetLife Facility by approximately   $28.3 million  . 
  Farm Credit West Note Payable 
  On October 13, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Central Avenue, we closed on a loan from Farm Credit West for approximately   $3.9 million  .  The mortgage note is scheduled to mature on   November 1, 2041  , and will bear interest (before interest patronage) at a fixed rate of   3.94%   per annum through September 30, 2026, thereafter converting to a variable rate determined by Farm Credit West, unless another fixed rate is established. 
  Distributions 
  On   October 11, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared the following monthly cash distributions to common stockholders and holders of our Term Preferred Stock: 

The same amounts paid to common stockholders will be paid as distributions on each OP Unit held by non-controlling limited partners of the Operating Partnership as of the above record dates.

  OVERVIEW 
  General 
  We are an externally-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that is engaged primarily in the business of owning and leasing farmland; we are not a grower, nor do we farm the properties we own.  We currently own   57   farms comprised of   33,997   acres across   seven   states in the U.S. (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska and Oregon).  We also own several farm-related facilities, such as cooling facilities, box barns, packinghouses, processing facilities and various storage facilities.  These farms and facilities are currently leased to   40   different, unrelated tenants that are either independent or corporate farming operations.  We intend to acquire more farmland in these and other states in our regions of focus that is already or will be leased to farmers, and we expect that most of our future tenants will also be independent or corporate farming operations that are unrelated to us.  We also expect to acquire more property related to farming, such as cooling facilities, freezer buildings, packinghouses, box barns, silos, storage facilities, greenhouses, processing plants and distribution centers.  We generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, an arrangement under which, in addition to rent, the tenant is required to pay the related taxes, insurance costs (including drought insurance if we were to acquire properties that depend upon rainwater for irrigation), maintenance and other operating costs.  We may also elect to sell farmland at certain times, such as when the land could be developed by others for urban or suburban uses. 
  We were incorporated in 1997, primarily for the purpose of operating strawberry farms through our former subsidiary, Coastal Berry Company, LLC ( Coastal Berry ), an entity that provided growing, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh berries and other agricultural products.  We operated Coastal Berry as our primary business until 2004, when it was sold to Dole Food Company ( Dole ).  Since 2004, our operations have consisted of leasing our farms to third-party tenants.  We do not currently intend to enter into the business of growing, packing or marketing farmed products; however, if we do so in the future, we expect that it would be through a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ). 
  We conduct substantially all of our investment activities through, and all of our properties are held, directly or indirectly, by, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ).  Gladstone Land Corporation controls the Operating  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

Partnership as its sole general partner and currently owns approximately   89.2%   of the units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ). 
  We intend to continue to lease our farms and farm-related facilities to independent or corporate farming operations that sell their products through national corporate marketers-distributors.  We expect to continue to earn rental and interest income from our investments. 
  Gladstone Management Corporation (our  Adviser ) manages our real estate portfolio pursuant to an advisory agreement, and Gladstone Administration, LLC (our  Administrator ) provides administrative services to us pursuant to an administration agreement.  Our Adviser and our Administrator collectively employ all of our personnel and pay directly their salaries, benefits and general expenses. 
  Leases 
  General 
  Most of our agricultural leases are on a triple-net basis and have original terms ranging from   3   to   10   years for farms growing row crops and   5   to   15   years for farms growing permanent crops, often with options to extend the lease further.  Rent is generally payable to us up front on either an annual or semi-annual basis.  Further, most of our leases contain provisions that provide for annual increases in the rental amounts payable by the tenants, often referred to as escalation clauses.  The escalation clauses may specify fixed dollar amount or percentage increases each year, or it may be variable, based on standard cost of living or inflation indices.  In addition, some leases that are longer-term in nature may require a regular survey of comparable land rents, with the rent owed per the lease being adjusted to reflect then-current market rents.  We also have leases that include variable rents based on the success of the harvest each year.  In these types of agreements, we will generally require the lease to include the guarantee of a minimum amount of rental income that satisfies our investment return criteria.  Currently, our   57   farms are leased under agricultural leases with original terms ranging from   3   to   15   years, with   39   farms leased on a pure triple-net basis, and   18   farms leased on a partial-net basis, with the landlord responsible for all or a portion of the related property taxes.  Additionally,   five   of our farms are leased under agreements that include a variable rent component. 
  We monitor our tenants  credit quality on an ongoing basis by, among other things, periodically conducting site visits of the properties to ensure farming operations are taking place and to assess the general maintenance of the properties.  To date, we have not identified any changes to credit quality of our tenants, and all tenants continue to pay pursuant to the terms of their respective leases. 
  Lease Expirations 
  Farm leases are often short-term in nature, so in any given year, we may have multiple leases up for renewal or extension.  As of January 1, 2016, we had   two   agricultural leases that were originally due to expire in 2016.  One lease was on a farm in Florida, and we renewed the lease for an additional   three years   at an annualized, straight-line rental rate representing an increase of   17.9%   over that of the previous lease.  The second lease was on a farm in California, and we renewed the lease for an additional   four years   at an annualized, straight-line rental rate representing an increase of   28.1%   over that of the previous lease.  However, in connection with the renewal of the lease on our California farm, we also assumed the responsibility for the property taxes on the property, which were the tenant's responsibility under the old lease.  Factoring in the additional property tax expense with the increased rental rate, the expected overall increase in annualized net income from the property under the term of the new lease is expected to be   9.0%   higher than that under the old lease. 
  We have begun negotiations with the existing tenants on our farms that have leases scheduled to expire in 2017, and we anticipate being able to renew each of the leases prior to their respective expirations.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the leases at rates favorable to us, if at all, or be able to find replacement tenants, if necessary.

     Recent Developments 
  Investment, Leasing and Other Portfolio Activity 
  Property Acquisitions 
  Since July 1, 2016, through the date of this filing, we have acquired   ten   farms in   six   separate transactions, which are summarized in the table below: 

(1)   
    Annualized straight-line amount is based on the minimum cash rental payments guaranteed under the lease, as required under GAAP. 
               (2)   
    Acquisition accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 360.  As such, all acquisition-related costs were capitalized and allocated among the identifiable assets acquired.  The figures above represent only the costs paid or accrued for as of the date of this filing. 
               (3)   
    Acquisition accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805.  As such, all acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred, other than direct leasing costs, which were capitalized.  In aggregate, we incurred   $4,850   of direct leasing costs in connection with these acquisitions. 
               (4)   
    As partial consideration for the acquisition of this property, we issued   125,677   OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately   $1.5 million   as of the acquisition date.  We incurred approximately   $8,235   of legal costs in connection with the issuance of these OP Units. 
               (5)   
    As partial consideration for the acquisition of this property, we issued   343,750   OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately   $3.9 million   as of the acquisition date.  We incurred approximately   $21,732   of legal costs in connection with the issuance of these OP Units. 
               (6)   
    Lease also provides for a variable rent component based on the gross crop revenues earned on the property.  The figure above represents only the minimum cash rents guaranteed under the lease. 
     Existing Properties 
  Since July 1, 2016, the following significant events occurred with regard to our already-existing properties:    
             
    Espinosa Road: 
                
    On July 5, 2016, we received payment of approximately   $164,000   (including   $4,000   of accrued interest) from the California Department of Transportation ("CalTrans") in connection with the settlement of an eminent domain lawsuit for   4.5   acres of nonfarmable land on Espinosa Road (the "CalTrans Settlement").  The portion of this payment allocated to our cost basis of the   4.5   nonfarmable acres was approximately   $156,000  . 
                
    On August 25, 2016, we renewed the lease with the tenant occupying Espinosa Road, which was originally set to expire on October 31, 2016.  The lease was renewed for an additional   four years  , through   October 31, 2020  , with annualized, straight-line rental income of   $997,017  , representing   28.1%   increase over that of the previous lease.  In connection with the renewal, we also assumed responsibility for the property taxes on Espinosa Road, which were the tenant's responsibility under the old lease.  Factoring in the additional property tax  
     
   27 

     Table of Contents  

expense with the increased rental rate, the expected overall increase in annualized net income from the property over the term of the new lease is expected to be   9.0%   higher than that under the old lease. 
  Colding Loop.    On July 15, 2016, we terminated the lease with the tenant occupying Colding Loop and subsequently entered into a new lease with a new tenant to occupy the property on August 5, 2016.  The new lease is scheduled to expire on August 4, 2017, and provides for minimum rental payments of   $72,400   over its term.  In connection with the early termination of the previous lease, we wrote off   $20,697   and   $84,600   of deferred rent asset balances to bad debt expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  In addition, during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we expensed   $8,635   of unamortized leasing costs associated with the previous lease. 
  Financing Activity 
  MetLife Facility 
  On October 5, 2016, we closed on an amendment to our credit facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife ), which previously consisted of a   $100.0 million   long-term note payable (the "2015 MetLife Term Note") and a   $25.0 million   revolving equity line of credit (the "2015 MetLife Line of Credit" and, together with the 2015 MetLife Term Note, the "MetLife Facility").  Pursuant to the amendment, the MetLife Facility now consists of the 2015 MetLife Term Note, the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit, a   $50.0 million   long-term note payable (the "2016 MetLife Term Note") and a   $25.0 million   revolving equity line of credit (the "2016 MetLife Line of Credit").  Simultaneous with the closing of the amendment, we drew approximately   $21.6 million   under the 2016 MetLife Term Note, with   $21.0 million   of the proceeds being used to repay the balance previously outstanding under the 2015 MetLife Line of Credit. 
  The 2016 MetLife Term Note is scheduled to mature on   January 5, 2029  , and bears interest at a fixed rate of   3.16%   per annum (which rate is fixed until   January 5, 2027  ), plus an unused fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts.  The 2016 MetLife Line of Credit is scheduled to mature on   April 5, 2024  , and bears interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of   2.25%  , with a minimum annualized rate of   2.50%  , plus an unused fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts. 
  Among other changes, the amendment to the MetLife Facility: 
             
    increased the overall loan-to-value ratio on the underlying properties pledged as collateral under the MetLife Facility from   58%   to   60%  ; 
        All other material items of the MetLife Facility remained unchanged. 
  In addition, we updated the appraisals of certain properties that serve as collateral under the MetLife Facility, which resulted in increased overall valuations, and pledged three additional properties as collateral under the facility.  In conjunction with the increase in the loan-to-value ratio on the underlying collateral, these events increased our overall availability under the MetLife Facility by approximately   $28.3 million  . 
  Farm Credit 
  Farm Credit CFL 
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we received interest patronage, or refunded interest, from Farm Credit of Central Florida, FLCA ( Farm Credit CFL ), representing a   16.1%   refund of the interest accrued on all borrowings from Farm Credit CFL during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  This interest patronage reduced the interest rates on our borrowings from Farm Credit CFL during the year ended   December 31, 2015  , from a weighted-average stated interest rate of   3.42%   to a weighted-average effective interest rate of   2.87%  .  We are unable to estimate the amount of interest patronage to be received, if any, related to interest accrued during 2016 on our Farm Credit CFL borrowings. 
  On July 1, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Orange Avenue, we closed on a loan from Farm Credit CFL for approximately   $3.1 million  . Terms of this note are summarized in the following table:

     Table of Contents  

On October 13, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Central Avenue, we closed on a loan from Farm Credit West, FLCA ("Farm Credit West"), for approximately   $3.9 million  .  Terms of this note are summarized in the following table: 

(1)   
    Rate represents the stated interest rate, before interest patronage. 
     Farmer Mac 
  Pursuant to a bond purchase agreement we entered into with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ("Farmer Mac") and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Farmer Mac, for a secured note purchase facility that provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate principal amount of   $125.0 million   (the "Farmer Mac Facility"), we issued one bond on August 22, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Lithia Road on August 11, 2016.  The terms of the bond issuance are summarized in the following table: 

Term Preferred Stock 
  On   August 17, 2016  , we completed a public offering of   6.375%   Series A Cumulative Term Preferred Stock, par value   $0.001   per share (the "Term Preferred Stock"), at a public offering price of   $25.00   per share.  As a result of this offering, including the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, we issued a total of   1,150,000   shares of the Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately   $28.8 million   and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses borne by us, of approximately   $27.6 million  .  These proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness, to fund new property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.  The Term Preferred Stock is traded under the ticker symbol, "LANDP," on the NASDAQ Global Market.  The Term Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common stock or any other securities.   
  Generally, we may not redeem shares of the Term Preferred Stock prior to   September 30, 2018  , except in limited circumstances to preserve our qualification as a REIT.  On or after   September 30, 2018  , we may redeem the shares at a redemption price of   $25.00   per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends to but excluding the date of redemption.  The shares of the Term Preferred have a mandatory redemption date of   September 30, 2021  .  We incurred approximately   $1.2 million   in total offering costs related to this issuance, which have been recorded net of the Term Preferred Stock as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we will amortize these costs over the redemption period, which ends on   September 30, 2021  . 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate distributions on our Term Preferred Stock of   $218,919  , or approximately   $0.19   per share. 
  At-the-Market Program 
  On August 7, 2015, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. and Ladenburg Thalmann   Co., Inc. (each a  Sales Agent ), under which we may issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock up to   $30.0 million   (the  ATM Program ).  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued and sold   31,934   shares of our common stock at an average sales price of   $11.29   per share under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of   $360,472   and net proceeds of   $355,057  .  To date, we have sold   64,561   shares of our common stock at an average sales price of   $10.23   per share under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of   $660,176   and net proceeds of   $650,266  .

Portfolio Diversity 
  Since our initial public offering in January 2013 (the  IPO ), we have expanded our original portfolio of   12   farms leased to   7   different, unrelated tenants to a current portfolio of   57   farms leased to   40   different, unrelated tenants.  While our focus remains in farmland suitable for growing fresh produce annual row crops, such as berries and vegetables, we have also begun to diversify our portfolio into farmland suitable for other crop types, including permanent crops, consisting primarily of almonds, pistachios and blueberries, and certain commodity crops, consisting primarily of corn and beans.  The following table summarizes the different sources of revenues for our properties with leases in place as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    Includes berries and other fruits, such as melons, raspberries and strawberries, and vegetables, such as cabbage, carrots, celery, cilantro, cucumbers, edamame, green beans, lettuce, mint, onions, peas, peppers, potatoes, radicchio, spinach and tomatoes.

    Consists primarily of rental revenue from: (i) farm-related facilities, such as coolers, packinghouses, distribution centers, residential houses for tenant farmers and other farm-related buildings; (ii) a surface area lease with an oil company on a small parcel of one of our properties; and (iii) unimproved or nonfarmable acreage on certain of our farms. 
     Our acquisition of   45   farms since our IPO has also allowed us to further diversify our portfolio geographically.  The following table summarizes the different geographic locations of our properties with leases in place as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Our Adviser and Administrator 
  We are externally managed pursuant to a contractual investment advisory arrangement (the  Advisory Agreement ) with our Adviser, under which our Adviser directly employs certain of our personnel and pays their payroll, benefits and general expenses directly, and our Administrator provides administrative services to us pursuant to a separate administration agreement with our Administrator (the  Administration Agreement ). Both our Adviser and Administrator are affiliates of ours, as their parent company is owned and controlled by Mr. David Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer. In addition, two of our executive officers, Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Terry Brubaker (our vice chairman and chief operating officer), serve as directors and executive officers of each of our Adviser and Administrator. Mr. Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary, also serves as our Administrator s president. A summary of each of these agreements is provided in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K. There were no material changes to either of these agreements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature to make certain estimates and assumptions. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  For the purposes of the following discussions on certain operating revenues and expenses, with regard to each of the comparisons between the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   2015  :

     Operating Revenues 
  Same-property Analysis

     Table of Contents  

NM = Not Meaningful 
    
  Rental revenues on a same-property basis increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, primarily due to our ability to renew existing leases at higher rates and earn additional revenue on capital improvements constructed on certain properties.  Rental revenues from acquired properties increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, due to the additional revenues recorded from owning the 5 and 9 new farms we acquired during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, for the full   three  - and   nine  -month periods in   2016  , coupled with the additional revenues earned from the   15   new farms we acquired subsequent to   September 30, 2015   (through   September 30, 2016  ).  Rental revenues from properties with vacancy decreased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, due to one property that was vacant during a portion of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The previous lease on this property was terminated early, and we entered into a new, one-year lease agreement with a new tenant at a lower rental rate than the previous lease.  While we expect to be able to renew the new lease on the property at an increase to the current rental rate upon its expiration, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the lease at a rate favorable to us, if at all, or be able to find a replacement tenant, if necessary. 
  Other Operating Revenues 
  Tenant recovery revenue represents real estate taxes and insurance premiums paid on certain of our properties that, per the leases, are required to be reimbursed by the tenant.  Corresponding amounts were also recorded as property operating expenses during the respective periods. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Same-property Analysis 

NM = Not Meaningful 
  Depreciation and amortization expense on a same-property basis increased for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year period, primarily due to additional depreciation on site improvements completed on certain properties subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , and decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year period, primarily as a result of certain lease intangible amortization periods expiring subsequent to   September 30, 2015  .  Depreciation and amortization expenses from acquired properties increased for both the    three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, due to the additional depreciation and amortization expense recorded from owning the 5 and 9 new farms we acquired during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, for the full   three  - and   nine  -month periods in   2016  , coupled with the additional depreciation and amortization expense incurred on the   15   new farms we acquired subsequent to   September 30, 2015   (through   September 30, 2016  ).  Depreciation and amortization expense on properties with vacancy increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, primarily due to the write-off of approximately $9,000 of unamortized leasing costs during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as a result of an early lease termination.

  Property operating expenses consist primarily of real estate taxes, insurance expense and other overhead expenses paid for certain of our properties.  Property operating expenses on a same-property basis decreased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, primarily due to a decrease in aggregate property tax expense on those properties, as two partial-net leases converted to pure, triple-net leases during the three months ended   December 31, 2015  , and, beginning in 2016, certain other properties were entered into land conservation contracts under the California Land Conservation Act, restricting the land to agricultural use and reducing the property tax assessments on those properties.  Property operating expenses on acquired properties increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, primarily due to additional property taxes owed on certain of the new farms we acquired during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , and subsequent to   September 30, 2015  .  On our overall portfolio, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we accrued approximately   $111,000   and   $355,000  , respectively, of aggregate real estate taxes related to certain of our farms, which included the recognition of certain prior-period supplemental taxes as a result of stepped-up tax assessments of those properties after our acquisitions of them, as compared to approximately   $153,000   and   $438,000   during the respective prior-year periods. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  Acquisition-related expenses generally consist of legal fees and fees incurred for third-party reports prepared in connection with potential acquisitions and the related due diligence analyses.  Acquisition-related expenses increased for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the differences in accounting treatment (i.e., as an asset acquisition under ASC 360 versus a business combination under ASC 805) of such expenses incurred in connection with the properties acquired during each of the respective periods, as well as due to acquiring farms in larger transaction sizes during the current-year period.  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   three   new farms that qualified as business combinations under ASC 805 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $28.9 million  , as compared to   two   farms for approximately   $11.0 million   in the prior-year period.  Acquisition-related expenses decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due  to additional state document stamp taxes on deed transfers incurred in connection with the acquisition of certain properties during the prior-year period. 
  The aggregate net fees to our Adviser, including both the management and incentive fees, increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the gross management fee increased by approximately   $29,000   and   $177,000  , respectively, primarily due to additional common equity raised over the prior 12 months.  Since   September 30, 2015  , we have raised approximately   $8.1 million   of net proceeds from follow-on common stock offerings, increasing the base (the book value of our common stockholders' equity) on which the management fee is calculated.  In addition, on a net basis, the net management fee increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, as a result of a finder's fee of approximately   $321,000   earned by our Adviser in connection with one of our acquisitions during the three months ended March 31, 2015, which the Adviser applied as a credit to the management fee for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Our Adviser also earned an incentive fee of approximately   $22,000   and   $181,000   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to our pre-incentive fee funds from operations exceeding the required hurdle rate of our total stockholders' equity at the end of the quarter, as stipulated in our Advisory Agreement.  The increase in our pre-incentive fee funds from operations was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues earned on properties acquired during and subsequent to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , coupled with a decrease in operating expenses other than depreciation and amortization expense.  No incentive fee was earned in either prior-year period. 
  The administration fee paid to our Administrator remained relatively flat for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods.  The increase for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to higher overall costs incurred by our Administrator and us using a higher share of our Administrator s resources in relation to those used by other funds serviced by our Administrator during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

General and administrative expenses increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, primarily as a result of additional legal costs incurred related to obtaining certain permits on one of our California properties and completing the CalTrans Settlement on Espinosa Road, increased accounting fees related to a higher volume of acquisitions during the current-year periods, additional costs associated with updating the valuations of certain of our farms and additional advertising and marketing expenses incurred during the current-year periods.  These increases were partially offset by lower overhead insurance expense.  In addition, during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we wrote off approximately   $21,000   and   $85,000  , respectively, of deferred rent asset balances related to a lease on one of our properties that was terminated prior to its expiration and subsequently re-leased to a new tenant. 
  Other Income (Expense) 
  Other income, which consists primarily of interest earned on short-term investments, state income tax refunds and interest patronage received from Farm Credit CFL, decreased for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to state income tax refunds from prior years that were received during the   three   month ended   September 30, 2015  , and increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to additional interest patronage received from Farm Credit CFL.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we received approximately   $94,000   from Farm Credit CFL of interest patronage related to interest accrued during 2015, compared to   $15,000   of interest patronage received during the prior-year period.  The receipt of this interest patronage resulted in a   16.1%   decrease in our effective interest rate on our aggregate borrowings from Farm Credit CFL during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Interest expense increased for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective prior-year periods, primarily due to increased overall borrowings.  The weighted-average principal balance of our aggregate borrowings for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $181.1 million   and   $179.9 million  , respectively, as compared to   $121.2 million   and   $109.8 million  , respectively, for the respective prior-year periods.  Including interest patronage received on our Farm Credit CFL borrowings, the overall effective interest rate charged on our aggregate borrowings, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, was   3.3%   and   3.0%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   3.4%   and   3.5%   for the respective prior-year periods. 
  During both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate distributions on our Term Preferred Stock, which distributions are treated as a component of interest expense, of approximately   $219,000  .  There was no Term Preferred Stock outstanding during 2015. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we received additional insurance proceeds as a result of a fire on one of our properties in California.  This claim was closed during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Overview 
  Since our IPO in January 2013, we have invested approximately   $271.8 million   into   45   new farms, and we have expended or accrued an additional   $15.5 million   for capital improvements on existing properties.  Our current short- and long-term sources of funds include cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, borrowings, including the undrawn commitments available under the MetLife Facility and the Farmer Mac Facility, and issuances of additional equity securities.  Our current available liquidity is approximately   $30.7 million  , consisting of   $3.0 million   in cash and, based on the current level of collateral pledged,   $27.7 million   of availability under the MetLife Facility, subject to compliance with covenants. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio (including our Term Preferred Stock as debt), at book value, was   71.6%  , which is up from   64.7%   as of   December 31, 2015  .  However, using the fair value basis of our farmland portfolio, our total-debt-to-total capitalization ratio (including our Term Preferred Stock as debt) as of   September 30, 2016  , was   58.9%  , which is up from   50.2%   as of   December 31, 2015   (see  Non-GAAP Financial Information Net Asset Value  below for an explanation of our fair value process).  We are currently exploring additional options for further access to capital. 
  Future Capital Needs 
  Our short- and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of making distributions to stockholders (including non-controlling OP Unitholders) to maintain our qualification as a REIT, funding our general operating costs, making principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings, making dividend payments on our Term Preferred Stock and funding new farmland acquisitions and other investments consistent with our investment strategy.  We intend to use a significant portion of our available liquidity to purchase additional farms and farm-related properties.  Our pipeline of potential acquisitions remains healthy, as we continue to actively seek and evaluate acquisitions of additional farms that satisfy our investment criteria.  We

     Table of Contents  

currently have   one   property under a signed purchase and sale agreement for a proposed purchase price of approximately   $13.1 million  , which we expect to be consummated during the three months ending December 31, 2016, and we have properties constituting an aggregate proposed purchase price of approximately   $54.0 million   under signed, non-binding letters of intent that we expect to be consummated during the three months ending March 31, 2017.  We currently have the capital required to complete these transactions for the proposed purchase price amounts, a portion of which is expected to be paid in OP Units.  We also have many other properties that are in various other stages of our due diligence process.  However, all potential acquisitions will be subject to our due diligence investigation of such properties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or acquiring any properties in the future. 
  We believe that our current and short-term cash resources will be sufficient to fund our distributions to stockholders (including non-controlling OP Unitholders), service our debt, pay dividends on our Term Preferred Stock and fund our current operating costs in the near term.  We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future equity issuances (including OP Units through our Operating Partnership as consideration for future acquisitions), long-term mortgage indebtedness and bond issuances and other secured and unsecured borrowings. 
  Cash Flow Resources 
  The following table summarizes total cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Operating Activities 
  The majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments we receive from our tenants, which is first used to fund our property-level operating expenses, with any excess cash being primarily used for principal and interest payments on our borrowings, management fees to our Adviser, administrative fees to our Administrator and other corporate-level expenses.  The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily due to additional rental payments received from farms we have acquired during the past 12 months, particularly prepaid rent received on the   13   farms acquired during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This increase was partially offset by increases in certain operating expenses as a result of increased acquisition activity, as well as an increase in cash paid for interest due to increased borrowings and distributions paid on our Term Preferred Stock (which distributions are treated as a component of interest expense) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Investing Activities 
  The increase in cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily due to additional capital improvements made on existing properties, as well as an increase in the cash paid for acquisitions of new farms during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which, in aggregate, exceeded that of the prior-year period by approximately   $12.0 million  . 
  Financing Activities 
  The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, was due to the   $27.6 million   of net proceeds received from the issuance of our Term Preferred Stock.  This increase was partially offset by the following:  (i) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we received approximately   $13.8 million   of net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock; (ii) net borrowings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $4.9 million   less than that during the prior-year period; and (iii) distributions paid on our common stock and OP Units held outside of the Company during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , exceeded that of the prior year by approximately   $1.0 million  , primarily due to an increased distribution run rate declared by our Board of Directors, as well as additional OP Units being issued as partial consideration in connection with certain properties we acquired during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Debt Capital 
  MetLife Facility 
  As amended on October 5, 2016, in aggregate, the MetLife Facility consists of   $150.0 million   of term notes and   $50.0 million   of revolving equity lines of credit.  In aggregate, we currently have approximately   $107.5 million   outstanding under the term notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of   3.16%   per annum (which rate is fixed until   January 5, 2027  ) and approximately   $4.2 million   outstanding under the lines of credit that bear interest at a variable rate of   3.11%  .  While approximately   $86.8 million   of the full commitment amount under the MetLife Facility remains undrawn, based on the current level of collateral pledged, we currently have approximately   $27.7 million   of availability under the facility. 
  Farm Credit Notes Payable 
  Farm Credit CFL Notes Payable 
  Since September 19, 2014, we have closed on   nine   separate loans with Farm Credit CFL for an aggregate amount of approximately   $25.3 million   (the "Farm Credit CFL Notes Payable").  We currently have approximately   $23.9 million   outstanding under the Farm Credit CFL Notes Payable that bear interest at an expected weighted-average effective rate (net of expected interest patronage) of   2.92%   and have a weighted-average maturity date of   March 2030  .  While we do not currently have any additional availability under our program with Farm Credit CFL based on the properties currently pledged as collateral, we may enter into additional borrowing agreements with Farm Credit CFL in connection with certain potential new acquisitions. 
  Farm Credit West Note Payable 
  Since April 4, 2016, we have closed on two separate loans with Farm Credit West for an aggregate amount of approximately $13.2 million (the "Farm Credit West Notes Payable").  We currently have approximately   $13.1 million   outstanding under the Farm Credit West Notes Payable that bear interest at an expected weighted-average effective interest rate (net of expected interest patronage) of   2.91%   and have a weighted-average maturity date of   February 2041  .  While we do not currently have any additional availability under our program with Farm Credit West based on the property currently pledged as collateral, we expect to enter into additional borrowing agreements with Farm Credit West in connection with certain potential new acquisitions. 
  Farmer Mac Facility 
  As amended on June 16, 2016, our agreement with Farmer Mac provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate amount of   $125.0 million  .  To date, we have issued aggregate bonds of approximately   $50.3 million   under the facility, and we currently have   $49.7 million   outstanding that bear interest at a weighted-average interest rate of   2.94%   and have a weighted-average maturity date of   October 2020  .  While approximately   $74.7 million   of the full commitment balance remains undrawn, we currently have   no   additional availability under the Farmer Mac Facility based on the current level of collateral pledged.  However, we expect to pledge certain potential new property acquisitions as collateral under the Farmer Mac Facility to utilize some or all of this remaining commitment balance.  If we have not issued bonds such that the aggregate bond issuances total   $125.0 million   by December 11, 2018, Farmer Mac has the option to be relieved of its obligation to purchase additional bonds under this facility. 
  Term Preferred Stock 
  On August 17, 2016, we raised   $27.6 million   in net proceeds through the issuance of   1,150,000   shares of our Term Preferred Stock.  These proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness, fund new property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes, and all proceeds from this issuance have been exhausted. 
  Equity Capital 
  Including approximately   $29.3 million   reserved for issuance under our ATM Program, we currently have the ability to raise up to   $247.6 million   of additional equity capital through the sale and issuance of securities that are registered under our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-194539) in one or more future offerings.  However, in the future, we may be limited in the amount of securities we may sell on Form S-3 should the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates decrease below   $75.0 million  , as has been the case at certain times during the past 12 months.  As we are currently above the   $75.0 million   threshold, this limitation will not impact us until the next measurement period, which will be when we file our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be above the   $75.0 million   threshold at that time.

In addition, we have the ability to, and may in the future, issue additional OP Units to third parties as consideration in future property acquisitions. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
  Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) developed funds from operations ( FFO ) as a relative non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the same basis determined under GAAP.  FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We further present core FFO ( CFFO ) and adjusted FFO ( AFFO ) as additional non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe both CFFO and AFFO improve comparability on a period-over-period basis and are more useful supplemental metrics for investors to use in assessing our operational performance on a more sustainable basis than FFO.  We believe that net income is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure to each of FFO, CFFO and AFFO. 
  We calculate CFFO by adjusting FFO for the following items: 

Acquisition-related expenses.    Acquisition-related expenses (i.e., due diligence costs) are incurred for investment purposes and do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our existing portfolio.  Further, due to the inconsistency in which these costs are incurred and how they are treated for accounting purposes, we believe the exclusion of these expenses improves comparability of our results on a period-to-period basis. 
                
    Acquisition-related accounting fees  .  Certain auditing and accounting fees we incur are directly related to acquisitions and vary depending on the number and complexity of acquisitions completed during a period.  Due to the inconsistency in which these costs are incurred, we believe the exclusion of these expenses improves comparability of our results on a period-to-period basis. 
                
    Other adjustments  .  We will adjust for certain non-recurring charges and receipts and will explain such adjustments accordingly. 
     Further, we calculate AFFO by adjusting CFFO for the following items: 

Cash rent adjustment.    This adjustment removes the effects of straight-lining rental income, as well as the amortization related to above-market lease values and accretion related to below-market lease values, deferred revenue and tenant improvements, resulting in rental income reflected on a modified accrual cash basis.  In addition to these adjustments, beginning with the three months ended June 30, 2015, we modified our calculation in our definition of AFFO to provide greater consistency and comparability due to the period-to-period volatility in which cash rents are received.  To coincide with our tenants  harvest seasons, our leases typically provide for cash rents to be paid at various points throughout the lease year, usually annually or semi-annually.  As a result, cash rents received during a particular period may not necessarily be comparable to other periods or represent the cash rents indicative of a given lease year.  Therefore, we have adjusted AFFO to normalize the cash rent received pertaining to a lease year over that respective lease year on a straight-line basis, resulting in cash rent being recognized ratably over the period in which the cash rent is earned.  We will apply the same modified definition of AFFO for all prior-year periods presented to provide consistency and better comparability. 
                
    Amortization of deferred financing costs  .  The amortization of costs incurred to obtain financing is excluded from AFFO, as it is a non-cash expense item that is not directly related to the performance of our properties.

The following table provides a reconciliation of our FFO, CFFO and AFFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), and a computation of diluted FFO, CFFO and AFFO per share, computed using the weighted-average number of total shares (including shares of our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners) outstanding during the respective periods. 

(1)   
    2015 adjustments consist of the removal of (i) a credit we received from our Advisor related to a new property acquisition during the three months ended March 31, 2015, (ii) repairs incurred as a result of a fire that were expensed during the three months ended March 31, 2015, and (iii) insurance proceeds received during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of the same fire. 
               (2)   
    Includes only OP Units held by third parties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   1,215,306   OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners, representing   10.8%   of all OP Units issued and outstanding.  There were no OP Units held by anyone other than the Company during 2015. 
     FFO, CFFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, which, unlike FFO, CFFO and AFFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income, and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.  Comparisons of FFO, CFFO and AFFO, using the NAREIT definition for FFO and the definitions above for CFFO and AFFO, to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the definitions used by such REITs. 
  Diluted funds from operations ( Diluted FFO ), diluted core funds from operations ( Diluted CFFO ) and diluted adjusted funds from operations ( Diluted AFFO ) per share are FFO, CFFO and AFFO, respectively, divided by the weighted-average number of total shares (including shares of our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners) outstanding on a fully-diluted basis during a period. We believe that diluted earnings per share is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure to each of Diluted FFO, CFFO and AFFO per share. 
  We believe that FFO, CFFO and AFFO and Diluted FFO, CFFO and AFFO per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO, CFFO and AFFO results in the same manner that investors use net income and EPS in evaluating net income.  In addition, because many REITs provide FFO, CFFO and AFFO and Diluted FFO, CFFO and AFFO per share information to the investment community, we believe these are useful supplemental measures when comparing us to other REITs. 
  Net Asset Value 
  Real estate companies are required to record real estate using the historical cost basis of the real estate, adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization, and, as a result, the carrying value of the real estate does not typically change as the fair value of the assets change.  Thus, a difficulty in owning shares of an asset-based company is determining the fair value  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

of the assets so that stockholders can see the value of the assets increase or decrease over time.  For this reason, we believe determining the fair value of our real estate assets is useful to our investors. 
  Determination of Fair Value 
  Our Board of Directors reviews and approves the valuations of our properties pursuant to a valuation policy approved by our Board of Directors (the  Valuation Policy ).  Such review and approval occurs in three phases: (i) prior to its quarterly meetings, the Board of Directors receives written valuation recommendations and supporting materials that are provided by professionals of the Adviser and Administrator, with oversight and direction from the chief valuation officer, who is also employed by the Administrator (collectively, the  Valuation Team  (ii) the valuation committee of the Board of Directors (the  Valuation Committee ), which is comprised entirely of independent directors, meets to review the valuation recommendations and supporting materials; and (iii) after the Valuation Committee concludes its meeting, it and the chief valuation officer present the Valuation Committee s findings to the entire Board of Directors so that the full Board of Directors may review and approve the fair values of our properties in accordance with the Valuation Policy.  Further, on a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors reviews the Valuation Policy to determine if changes thereto are advisable and also reviews whether the Valuation Team has applied the Valuation Policy consistently. 
  Per the Valuation Policy, our valuations are derived based on the following: 
             
    For properties acquired within 12 months prior to the date of valuation, the purchase price of the property will generally be used as the current fair value unless overriding factors apply.  In situations where OP Units are issued as partial or whole consideration in connection with the acquisition of a property, the fair value of the property will generally be the lower of:  (i) the agreed-upon purchase price between the seller and the buyer (as shown in the purchase and sale agreement or contribution agreement and using the agreed-upon pricing of the OP Units, if applicable), or (ii) the value as determined by an independent, third-party appraiser. 
                
    For real estate we acquired more than one year prior to the date of valuation, we determine the fair value either by relying on estimates provided by independent, third-party appraisers or through an internal valuation process.  In addition, if significant capital improvements take place on a property, we will typically have those properties reappraised upon completion of the project by an independent, third-party appraiser.  In any case, we intend to have each property valued by an independent, third-party appraiser at least once every three years, with interim values generally being determined by our internal valuation process. 
     Various methodologies were used, both by the appraisers and in our internal valuations, to determine the fair value of our real estate on a fee simple,  As Is  basis, including the sales comparison, income capitalization (or a discounted cash flow analysis) and cost approaches of valuation.  In performing their analyses, the appraisers (i) performed site visits to the properties, (ii) discussed each property with our Adviser and reviewed property-level information, including, but not limited to, property operating data, prior appraisals (as available), existing lease agreements, farm acreage, location, access to water and water rights, potential for future development and other property-level information, and (iii) reviewed information from a variety of sources about regional market conditions applicable to each of our properties, including, but not limited to, recent sale prices of comparable farmland, market rents for similar farmland, estimated marketing and exposure time, market capitalization rates and the current economic environment, among others.  In performing our internal valuations, we will consider the most recent appraisal available and use similar methodologies in determining an updated fair value.  We will also obtain updated market data related to the property, such as updated sales and market rent comparisons and market capitalization rates, and perform an updated assessment of the tenants  credit risk profiles, among others.  Sources of this data may come from market inputs from recent acquisitions of our own portfolio of real estate, recent appraisals of properties we own that are similar in nature and in the same region (as applicable) as the property being valued, market conditions and trends we observe in our due diligence process and conversations with appraisers, brokers and farmers. 
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

A breakdown of the methodologies used to value our properties and the aggregate value as of   September 30, 2016  , determined by each method is shown in the table below: 

(1)   
    Consists of the initial acquisition price (including the costs allocated to both tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed), plus subsequent improvements and other capitalized costs paid for by the Company that were associated with the properties, and adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. 
               (2)   
    97.9%   of this valuation, or approximately   $64.6 million  , is supported by values as determined by third-party appraisals performed between   April 2014   and   July 2015  .  The difference of   $1.4 million   represents the net appreciation of those properties since the time of such appraisals, as determined according to our Valuation Policy. 
      Some of the significant assumptions used by appraisers and the Valuation Team in valuing our portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , include land values per farmable acre, market rental rates per farmable acre and capitalization rates, among others.  These assumptions were applied on a farm-by-farm basis and were selected based on several factors, including comparable land sales, surveys of both existing and current market rates, discussions with other brokers and farmers, soil quality, size, location and other factors deemed appropriate.  A summary of these significant assumptions is provided in the following table: 

The table above applies only to the farmland portion of our portfolio and exclude assumptions made relating to farm-related property, such as cooling facilities and box barns, and other structures on our properties, including residential housing and horticulture, as their aggregate value was considered to be insignificant in relation to that of the farmland. 
  Our Valuation Team reviews the appraisals, including the significant assumptions and inputs used in determining the appraised values, and considers any developments that may have occurred since the time the appraisals were performed.  Developments considered that may have an impact on the fair value of our real estate include, but are not limited to, changes in tenant credit profiles; changes in lease terms, such as expirations and notices of non-renewals or to vacate; and potential asset sales, particularly those at prices different from the appraised values of our properties. 
  Management believes that the purchase prices of the farms acquired during the previous 12 months, the most recent appraisals available for the farms acquired prior to the previous 12 months that were not valued internally and the farms that were valued internally during the previous 12 months fairly represent the current market values of the properties as of   September 30, 2016  , and, accordingly, did not make any adjustment to these values. 
  A quarterly roll-forward of the change in our portfolio value for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from the prior value basis as of December 31, 2015, is provided in the table below: 

Management also determined fair values of all of its long-term borrowings.  Using a discounted cash flow analysis, management determined that the fair value of all long-term encumbrances on our properties as of   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $170.1 million  , as compared to a carrying value (excluding unamortized related debt issuance costs) of   $167.0 million  .  In addition, using the closing stock price as of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Term Preferred stock was  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

determined to be approximately   $29.7 million  , as compared to a carrying value (excluding unamortized related issuance costs) of   $28.8 million  . 
  Calculation of Estimated Net Asset Value 
  To provide our stockholders with an estimate of the fair value of our real estate assets, we intend to estimate the fair value of our farm properties, expressed in terms of net asset value ( NAV ), and provide that to our stockholders on a quarterly basis.  NAV is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial position of an equity REIT and is calculated as total equity, adjusted for the increase or decrease in fair value of our real estate assets and long-term borrowings (including any preferred stock required to be treated as debt for GAAP purposes) relative to their respective costs bases.  Further, we calculate NAV per common share by dividing NAV by our total common shares outstanding (consisting of our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners).  A reconciliation of NAV to total equity, which the Company believes is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, is provided below. 
  The fair values presented above and their usage in the calculation of net asset value per share presented below have been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management.  PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, has neither examined, compiled nor performed any procedures with respect to the fair values or the calculation of net asset value per common share, which utilizes information that is not disclosed within the financial statements, and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate our NAV per common share to be   $13.68  , as detailed below  : 

(1)   
    Per Net Cost Basis as presented in the table above. 
               (2)   
    Per Current Fair Value as presented in the table above. 
               (3)   
    Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of mortgage notes and bonds payable) and the Term Preferred Stock. 
               (4)   
    Long-term mortgage notes and bonds payable were valued using a discounted cash flow model.  The Term Preferred Stock was valued based on its closing stock price as of September 30, 2016. 
      A quarterly roll-forward in the estimated NAV per common share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is provided below: 

(1)   
    The net change in unrealized appreciation of farmland portfolio consists of three components: (i) an increase of   $0.22   due to the net appreciation in value of   18   farms that were valued during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , (ii) an increase of   $0.13   due to the aggregate depreciation and amortization expense recorded during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and (iii) a decrease of   $0.10   due to capital improvements made on certain properties that have not been considered in the determination of the respective properties  estimated fair values. 
               (2)   
    Includes common shares issued under the ATM Program and OP Units issued in connection with the acquisition of new farms. 
     
   42 

     Table of Contents  

Comparison of estimated NAV and estimated NAV per common share, using the definitions above, to similarly-titled measures for other REITs, may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the calculation or application of the definition of NAV used by such REITs.  In addition, the trading price of our common shares may differ significantly from our most recent estimated NAV per common share calculation.  For example, while we estimated the NAV per share as of   September 30, 2016  , to be   $13.68   per the calculation above, the closing price of our common stock on   September 30, 2016  , was   $10.59  , and it has subsequently traded between   $9.51   and   $10.92   per share. 
  While management believes the values presented reflect current market conditions, the ultimate amount realized on any asset will be based on the timing of such dispositions and the then-current market conditions.  There can be no assurance that the ultimate realized value upon disposition of an asset will approximate the estimated fair value above. 
  We intend to report any adjustments to the estimated NAV, as well as to the values of our properties, in this section on a quarterly basis, but in no case less than annually.  However, the determination of estimated NAV is subjective and involves a number of assumptions, judgments and estimates, and minor adjustments to these assumptions, judgments or estimates may have a material impact on our overall portfolio valuation.  In addition, many of the assumptions used are sensitive to market conditions and can change frequently.  Changes in the market environment and other events that may occur during our ownership of these properties may cause the values reported above to vary from the actual fair value that may be obtained in the open market.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments.  The primary market risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk.  Certain of our existing leases contain escalations based on market indices, and certain of our existing borrowings are subject to variable interest rates.  Further, the interest rates on certain of our fixed-rate borrowings are either fixed for a finite period before converting to variable rate or are subject to periodic adjustments.  Although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring certain provisions into many of our leases, such as escalation clauses or adjusting the rent to prevailing market rents at two- to three-year intervals, these features do not eliminate this risk.  To date, we have not entered into any derivative contracts to attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings outstanding, which accounted for approximately   87.2%   of our total indebtedness, at cost, as of   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $170.1 million  .  However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings.  If market interest rates had been one percentage point lower or higher than those rates in place as of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings would have increased or decreased by approximately   $6.6 million   or   $6.1 million  , respectively. 
  There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from that disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of necessarily achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any such material legal proceedings threatened against us. 
   
                 Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 

Our business is subject to certain risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities.  For a discussion of these risks, please refer to this section and the section captioned  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed by us with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2016.  The risks described below and in our Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. 
  We may enter into tax protection agreements in the future if we issue OP Units in connection with the acquisition of properties, which could limit our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties. 
  Our Operating Partnership may enter into tax protection agreements in connection with issuing OP Units to acquire additional properties which could provide that if we dispose of any interest in the protected acquired property prior to a certain time, we will indemnify the other party for its tax liabilities attributable to the built-in gain that exists with respect to such property.  Therefore, although it may be in our stockholders  best interests that we sell one of these properties, it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so if we are a party to such a tax protection agreement.  While we do not currently have any of these tax protection agreements in place currently, we cannot guarantee that we will not enter into such agreements in the future. 
  Our redemption of OP Units could result in the issuance of a large number of new shares of our common stock and/or force us to expend significant cash, which may limit our funds necessary to make distributions on our common stock. 
  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, third parties owned approximately   10.81215685%   of the outstanding OP Units.  Following any contractual lock-up provisions, including the one-year mandatory holding period, a non-controlling limited partner of our Operating Partnership may require us to redeem the OP Units it holds for cash.  At our election, we may satisfy the redemption through the issuance of shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.  However, the limited partners  redemption right may not be exercised if and to the extent that the delivery of the shares upon such exercise would result in any person violating the ownership and transfer restrictions set forth in our charter.  If a large number of OP Units were redeemed, it could result in the issuance of a large number of new shares of our common stock, which could dilute our existing stockholders  ownership.  Alternatively, if we were to redeem a large number of OP Units for cash, we may be required to expend significant amounts to pay the redemption price, which may limit our funds necessary to make distributions on our common stock.  Further, if we do not have sufficient cash on hand at the time the OP Units are tendered for redemption, we may be forced to sell additional shares of our common stock in order to raise cash, which could cause dilution to our existing stockholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
  Holders of our Term Preferred Stock and future holders of any securities ranking senior to our common stock have dividend and/or liquidation rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock.  Additional issuances of securities senior to our common stock may negatively impact the value of our common stock and further restrict the ability of holders of our common stock to receive dividends and/or liquidation rights. 
  Our capital structure includes issuance of our Term Preferred Stock.  In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity securities or issue debt securities.  Upon liquidation, holders of our Term Preferred Stock and other preferred stock we may issue in the future, holders of our debt securities, if any, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, including our line of credit, would receive a distribution of our available assets in full prior to the holders of our common stock.  Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.  Thus, our common stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us.  Further, holders of our Term Preferred Stock rank senior in priority of dividend payments, which may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends to our common stock holders at the current rate or at all. 
  We may not have sufficient earnings and profits in order for distributions on the Term Preferred Stock to be treated as dividends. 
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

The dividends payable by us on the Term Preferred Stock may exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, at the time of payment.  If that were to occur, it would result in the amount of dividends that exceed our earnings and profits being treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the holder s adjusted tax basis in the Term Preferred Stock and then, to the extent of any excess over such adjusted tax basis, as capital gain.

    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Sales of Unregistered Securities 
  As partial consideration in connection with the acquisition of 7,384 acres of farmland in Baca County, Colorado, on September 1, 2016, the Operating Partnership issued 125,677 OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately $1.5 million as of the acquisition date, subject to adjustment pursuant to the related contribution agreement, to the seller upon consummation of the transaction. 
  As partial consideration in connection with the acquisition of an aggregate 2,487 acres of real property located in Stanislaus and Merced Counties, California, on September 14, 2016, the Operating Partnership issued 343,750 OP Units, constituting an aggregate fair value of approximately $3.9 million as of the acquisition date, subject to adjustment pursuant to the related contribution agreement, to the seller upon consummation of the transaction.   
  With regard to the OP Units issued in connection with each of the transactions described above, following a one-year holding period, the OP Units will be redeemable for cash or, at the Company s discretion, exchangeable for shares of the Company s common stock, in accordance with the terms of the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. 
  The exchanges of the OP Units pursuant to the related contribution agreements were consummated without registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon the exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as transactions not involving any public offering.

Report of Independent Auditors 
  To the Shareholders of Gladstone Land Corporation 
  We have audited the accompanying Historical Statement of Revenues (the  Historical Statement ) of the Diego and Nevada Ranches (the  Properties ) for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statement 
  Management of Gladstone Land Corporation (the  Company ) is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Historical Statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the Historical Statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
  Auditor's Responsibility 
  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Historical Statement based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Statement is free from material misstatement.   
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Statement.  The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Historical Statement, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the Historical Statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Statement.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
  Opinion 
  In our opinion, the Historical Statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenues, as described in Note 2, of the Properties for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    
  Other Matter 
  The accompanying Historical Statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission as described in Note 2 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Properties  revenues.  Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Diego and Nevada Ranches 
  Notes to Statements of Revenues 
  Note 1.  Business 
  The accompanying historical statement of revenues relates to the operations of the Diego and Nevada Ranches (collectively, the  Property ), consisting of the revenue of   2,487   total acres of real property located in Stanislaus and Merced Counties, California. Gladstone Land Corporation, through its wholly-owned operating partnership, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership, and, collectively with Gladstone Land Corporation, the  Company ), acquired the Property from an unaffiliated party on   September 14, 2016  , for total consideration of (i) approximately   $23.4 million   in cash, and (ii)   343,750   units of limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ).  The OP Units issued were valued at   $11.21   per unit as of the acquisition date, resulting in total consideration paid for the Property of approximately   $27.2 million  , exclusive of closing costs, and subject to certain other credits and debits as set forth in the acquisition agreements. 
  Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The accompanying historical statements of revenues were prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X, as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, in connection with the Company s acquisition of the Property.  The historical statements are not representative of the actual operations of the Property for the periods presented, nor indicative of future operations; however, the Company is not aware of any material factors relating to the Property that would cause the reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating results.  In addition, certain expenses, primarily amortization and interest expense, which may not be comparable to the expenses expected to be incurred by the Company in future operations of the Property, have been excluded.  Additionally, the Company s lease with the tenant is structured in such a way that the tenant is responsible for substantially all of the Property s operating expenses.  The Company does not expect to incur any significant operating expenses in the future operations of the Property, so those expenses have been excluded from this historical statement. 
  Revenue Recognition  
  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with the terms of the related lease.  
  Use of Estimates  
  The preparation of this historical statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
  Note 3.  Leases 
  On August 7, 2012, the Property entered into two 7-year, triple-net lease agreements with a single tenant for the entire Property.  Each lease is scheduled to expire on November 15, 2019, and includes three, 5-year extension options, followed by one, 3-year extension option. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , aggregate future minimum rent payments to be received by the Property under the leases were as follows: 

Major Tenant  
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Property s total rental income of   $1,155,606   was attributable to only one tenant.

Note 4.  Unaudited Interim Statements 
  The historical statement of revenues for the   six months ended June 30, 2016  , is unaudited.  As a result, this interim historical statement should be read in conjunction with the historical statement and notes included in the   December 31, 2015  , historical statement of revenues.  The interim historical statement reflects all adjustments which management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of the historical statement of revenues for the interim period presented.  These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The historical statement of revenues for such interim period is not necessarily indicative of the results of the entire year.  
  Note 5.  Subsequent Events  
  The Company evaluated all events that have occurred subsequent to   December 31, 2015  , through   November 14, 2016  , the date the historical statement was issued.

GLADSTONE LAND CORPORATION 
  UNAUDITED PRO-FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  On   September 14, 2016  , Gladstone Land Corporation, through its wholly-owned operating partnership, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership, and, collectively with Gladstone Land Corporation, the  Company ), acquired approximately   2,487   total acres of real property located in Stanislaus and Merced Counties, California (the  Property ), for total consideration of (i) approximately   $23.4 million   in cash, and (ii)   343,750   units of limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ).  The OP Units issued were valued at   $11.21   per unit as of the acquisition date, resulting in total consideration of approximately   $27.2 million  , exclusive of acquisition-related costs of approximately   $104,000  .  The Company funded this acquisition by drawing   $21.0 million   on its line of credit with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife ) and by using approximately   $2.4 million   of proceeds from the issuance of its   6.375%   Series A cumulative term preferred stock (the  Term Preferred Stock ), which issuance was completed in August 2016.  In evaluating the Property as a potential acquisition and determining the appropriate amount of consideration to be paid, the Company considered a variety of factors, including location, water and soil quality, credit quality of the tenant, terms of the in-place lease, comparative land values, and comparative rents.  At closing, the Company assumed the existing leases on the Property with a single tenant that has leased the Property for over four years.  Each of the assumed leases expires on November 15, 2019, and includes three, 5-year extension options, followed by one, 3-year extension option.  In aggregate, the leases provide for annualized, straight-line rents of approximately   $1.2 million  . 
  The pro-forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   June 30, 2016  , and the pro-forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and the   six months ended June 30, 2016  , have been prepared to comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The pro-forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   June 30, 2016  , is presented as if the acquisition of the Property was completed on    June 30, 2016  .  The pro-forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and the   six months ended June 30, 2016  , are presented as if the acquisition of the Property was completed on   January 1, 2015  .  The pro-forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   June 30, 2016  , and the pro-forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and the   six months ended June 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of what the actual financial position and operating results would have been had the Property acquired in the current year been acquired on   June 30, 2016  , and   January 1, 2015  , respectively, nor do they purport to represent the Company s future financial position or operating results. 
  The unaudited pro-forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Gladstone Land Corporation and the accompanying notes thereto in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2016, and the historical statements of revenues, filed in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X, of the Diego and Nevada Ranches, for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and the   six months ended June 30, 2016  .  In the Company s opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect the effect of the Property acquired have been made.

GLADSTONE LAND CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO-FORMA  
  CONDENDSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  On   September 14, 2016  , Gladstone Land Corporation, through its wholly-owned operating partnership, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership,  and, collectively with Gladstone Land Corporation, the  Company ), acquired approximately   2,487   total acres of farmland located in Stanislaus and Merced Counties, California (the  Property ), for total consideration of (i) approximately   $23.4 million   in cash, and (ii)   343,750   units of limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ).  The OP Units issued were valued at   $11.21   per unit as of the acquisition date, resulting in total consideration of approximately   $27.2 million  , exclusive of acquisition-related costs of approximately   $104,000  .  The Company funded this acquisition by drawing   $21.0 million   on its line of credit with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife ) and by using approximately   $2.4 million   of proceeds from the issuance of its   6.375%   Series A cumulative term preferred stock (the  Term Preferred Stock ), which issuance was completed in August 2016.  At closing, the Company assumed the existing leases on the Property with a single tenant that has leased the Property for over four years.  Each of the assumed leases expires on November 15, 2019, and includes three, 5-year extension options, followed by one, 3-year extension option.  In aggregate, the leases provide for annualized, straight-line rents of approximately   $1.2 million  . 
  Adjustments to Unaudited Pro-forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet 
  The unaudited pro-forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   June 30, 2016  , reflects the following adjustments:    
           (A) 
    The acquisition of the Property is reflected in the unaudited pro-forma condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company at fair market value.  A preliminary estimate of the values allocated to real estate and lease intangibles are shown in the table below.  The allocation of the purchase price in the table below is based upon the Company s best estimates and is subject to change based upon the final determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.   

The value allocated to irrigation system improvements is depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives, which range from 7 to 30 years.  In-place lease values and leasing costs are amortized over the remaining, non-cancelable terms of the in-place leases, including that of any extension options expected to be exercised by the tenant. Below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining, non-cancelable terms of the in-place leases, including that of any fixed-price or below-market renewal options or any such extension options expected to be exercised by the tenant. 
           (B) 
    In connection with the acquisition of the Property, the Company drew   $21.0 million   on its line of credit with MetLife and used approximately   $2.4 million   of proceeds received from the issuance of its Term Preferred Stock. 
              (C) 
    In connection with the acquisition of these properties, the Company incurred total acquisition-related costs of approximately   $104,000  . Of this amount, approximately   $22,000   was incurred in connection with the OP Units that were issued as partial consideration for the acquisition and is included as an adjustment to Non-controlling interests in operating partnership, and approximately   $1,000   was incurred in connection with review of the in-place leases we assumed and was capitalized as an addition to Lease intangibles, net on the accompanying Pro-

forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, of the   $104,000   of acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with acquiring the Property, approximately   $40,000   was paid at closing and is reflected as an adjustment to Cash; the remaining   $64,000   was included as an adjustment to Accounts payable and accrued expenses.  No acquisition-related costs were incurred prior to   June 30, 2016  .  These adjustments are not included as a pro-forma adjustment in the Pro-Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
           (D) 
    As of   June 30, 2016  , there were   9,992,941   shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, and there were   745,879   OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners.  In connection with the acquisition of the Property, we issued   343,750   additional OP Units as partial consideration.  On a pro-forma basis, the total amount of OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners represents approximately   9.8%   of all OP Units outstanding as of   December 31, 2016  .  Therefore, a rebalancing of approximately   $1.1 million   was necessary and was recorded as an adjustment to each of Additional paid in capital and Non-controlling interests in operating partnership. 
     Adjustments to Unaudited Pro-forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  
  The adjustments to the pro-forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and the   six months ended June 30, 2016  , are as follows: 
           (A) 
    The pro-forma adjustment to rental income for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , consists of two parts: 
              (i) 
    $1,155,606   to reflect the revenues recognized on a straight-line basis in the historical period; and 
              (ii) 
    An increase of   $27,124   to reflect the accretion of the below-market lease value recorded in connection with the acquisition of the Property assuming the acquisition had occurred on   January 1, 2015  . 
     The pro-forma adjustment to rental income for the   six months ended June 30, 2016  , consists of two parts: 
           (i) 
    $578,427   to reflect the revenues recognized on a straight-line basis in the historical period; and 
              (ii) 
    An increase of   $13,561   to reflect the accretion of the below-market lease value recorded in connection with the acquisition of the Property assuming the acquisition had occurred on   January 1, 2015  . 
              (B) 
    The pro-forma adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense are the Company s estimates of the expenses that would have been recorded assuming the Property was acquired on   January 1, 2015  . 
              (C) 
    The Company funded the acquisition, in part, with a   $21.0 million   draw on its line of credit with MetLife.  The line of credit is scheduled to mature in   April 2024   and bore interest at a rate of   2.75%   and   2.86%   per annum as of   January 1, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, plus an unused line fee of   0.20%   on undrawn amounts.  The pro-forma adjustments to interest expense are the Company s estimates of interest expense incurred on the line of credit disbursement, assuming the disbursement occurred on   January 1, 2015  . 
              (D) 
    The Company funded the acquisition, in part, by using   $2.4 million   of proceeds from the issuance of its Term Preferred Stock, which issuance was completed in   August 2016  .  The Term Preferred Stock has a mandatory redemption date of   September 30, 2021  , and pay cumulative dividends at a rate of   6.375%   per annum.  The pro-forma adjustments to distributions attributable to mandatorily-redeemable term preferred stock are the Company s estimates of distributions paid on the Term Preferred Stock used to acquire the Property. 
              (E) 
    In connection with the acquisition of the Property, the Company issued   343,750   OP Units as partial consideration, which, assuming the acquisition and the issuance of these OP Units occurred on   January 1, 2015  , constitutes, on a weighted-average basis,   3.8%   and   3.3%   of all OP Units issued and outstanding during the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and   six months ended June 30, 2016  , respectively, including those owned by the Company.  The pro-forma adjustments to net income attributable to non-controlling interests represent the Company s estimates of the portion of net income that would have been attributable to non-controlling interests, assuming the acquisition had occurred on   January 1, 2015  .

SECURITIES LAW REPRESENTATIONS 

1.  Representations  .    In deciding to engage in the Transactions, including the acquisition of the OP Units, neither the Contributor nor any equity holder thereof is relying upon any representations made to it by the Recipient Parties, or any of their respective partners, officers, employees, or agents that are not contained herein.

  2.  No Registration.    The Contributor and each equity holder thereof understands that the offer and sale of the OP Units have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations in effect thereunder (the  Act ) or any state securities laws, and are instead being offered and sold in reliance on an exemption from such registration requirements and that the REIT s and the Operating Partnership s reliance on such exemption is predicated in part on the accuracy and completeness of the representations and warranties of the Contributor contained herein. 
    
  3.  Investment Intent  .    The Contributor is acquiring the OP Units solely for its own account for the purpose of investment and not as a nominee or agent for any other person and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution of such OP Units. The Contributor agrees and acknowledges that except as permitted by the Partnership Agreement and this Contribution Agreement, it will not, directly or indirectly, offer, transfer, sell, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (each, a  Transfer ) any of the OP Units, unless (i) the Transfer is pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and qualification or other compliance under applicable blue sky or state securities laws, or (ii) counsel for the Contributor (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the REIT) shall have furnished the REIT and the Operating Partnership with an opinion, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the REIT and the General Partner, to the effect that no such registration is required because of the availability of an exemption from registration under the Act. The Contributor acknowledges the additional restrictions on Transfer imposed by the REIT Charter and the Partnership Agreement. 
    
  4.  Knowledge  .    The Contributor is knowledgeable, sophisticated and experienced in business and financial matters and fully understands the limitations on transfer imposed by applicable securities laws and as described in this Agreement and the Partnership Agreement.

  5.  Holding Period; Restrictions  .    The Contributor acknowledges that it has been advised that: (i) the OP Units issued pursuant to this Agreement are  restricted securities  (unless registered in accordance

with applicable U.S. securities laws) under applicable federal securities laws and may be disposed of only pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption therefrom and the Contributor understands that the Operating Partnership has no obligation or intention to register the issuance or the resale of any of the OP Units); accordingly, the Contributor may have to bear indefinitely the economic risks of an investment in the OP Units; (ii) a restrictive legend in the form hereafter set forth shall be placed on the OP Unit certificates (if any); and (iii) a notation shall be made in the records of the Operating Partnership or the applicable transfer agent, if any, indicating that the OP Units are subject to restrictions on transfer and ownership, including those set forth in the Partnership Agreement. 
    
  6.  Value  .    The Contributor understands that no federal agency (including the Securities and Exchange Commission) or state agency has made or will make any finding or determination as to the fairness of an investment in the OP Units. 
    
  7.  Lack of Market for OP Units  .    The Contributor understands that there is no established public, private or other market for the OP Units to be acquired by the Contributor hereunder and it is not anticipated that there will be any public, private or other market for such OP Units in the foreseeable future. 
    
  8.  Legend on Certificates Representing Shares of Common Stock  .    The Contributor acknowledges that any certificate representing shares of Common Stock that may be issuable at the REIT s election upon redemption of OP Units shall bear, the following legend, together with any legends required by the REIT Charter:

  5.4.5.      Survival  .  This Section 5.4 shall survive the Closing and the recordation of the Deed, or the earlier termination of this Agreement, except that Sections 5.4.1(i) and (ii), and 5.4.2(i), (ii) and (iii) shall not survive the termination of this Agreement prior to the Closing. 
    
  5.5.      Risk of Loss  .  Risk of loss from all causes except the fault of Buyer shall remain upon Seller until the Close of Escrow occurs.  Seller shall continue to maintain the insurance, if any, that Seller currently maintains on the Property until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement.  If, while risk of loss remains on Seller, the Property is damaged, except through fault of Buyer, in an amount less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Purchase Price, Buyer shall elect to either terminate this Agreement (in which event the provisions of Section 4.2(a) shall apply) or maintain this Agreement in full force (in which event the provisions of Section 4.4.1, shall apply).
