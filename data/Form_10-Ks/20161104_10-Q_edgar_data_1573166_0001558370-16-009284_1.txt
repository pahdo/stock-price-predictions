1.        Organization and Description of Business 

Organization 

Jones Energy, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed in March 2013 as a Delaware corporation to become a publicly-traded entity and the holding company of Jones Energy Holdings, LLC ( JEH ). As the sole managing member of JEH, the Company is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to JEH s business and consolidates the financial results of JEH and its subsidiaries. 

JEH was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on December 16, 2009 through investments made by the Jones family and through private equity funds managed by Metalmark Capital and Wells Fargo Energy Capital (collectively, the  Pre-IPO Owners ). JEH acts as a holding company of operating subsidiaries that own and operate assets that are used in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. 

The Company s certificate of incorporation authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The Class B common stock is held by the owners of JEH prior to the Company s initial public offering ( IPO ) and can be exchanged (together with a corresponding number of common units representing membership interests in JEH ( JEH Units )) for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. The Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holders to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Company s stockholders generally. As of September 30, 2016, the Company held 56,969,222 JEH Units and all of the preferred units representing membership interests in JEH, and the remaining 29,872,426 JEH Units are held by the Pre-IPO Owners. The Pre-IPO Owners have no voting rights with respect to their economic interest in JEH, resulting in the Company reporting this ownership interest as a non-controlling interest. 

The Company s certificate of incorporation also authorizes the Board of Directors of the Company to establish one or more series of preferred stock. Unless required by law or by any stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the authorized shares of preferred stock will be available for issuance without further action. Rights and privileges associated with shares of preferred stock are subject to authorization by the Board of Directors of the Company and may differ from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. 

On August 25, 2016, the Company issued 1.84 million shares of its 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Series A preferred stock ), pursuant to a registered public offering at $50 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $92 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.68 million. See Note 11,  Stockholders  and Mezzanine equity . 

Description of Business 

The Company is engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the mid-continent United States. The Company s assets are located within the Western Anadarko, Eastern Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Texas and Oklahoma, and are owned by JEH and its operating subsidiaries. The Company is headquartered in Austin, Texas. 

2.        Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s financial position as of December 31, 2015 and the   

5 

Table of Contents  

financial statements reported for September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the three and nine month periods then ended include the Company and all of its subsidiaries. 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP accounting principles for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information relating to the Company s organization and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been appropriately condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report. The Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report include all normal and recurring material adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented herein. It is recommended that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our most recent audited consolidated financial statements included in Jones Energy, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates 

There have been no significant changes in our use of estimates since those reported in Jones Energy, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Adopted in the current year-to-date period: 

In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-01,  Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items.  This ASU removes the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. Under existing guidance, an entity is required to separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is of an unusual nature and occurs infrequently. This separate, net of tax presentation will no longer be allowed. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Therefore, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-01 beginning in the period ended March 31, 2016. Adoption did not have a material impact on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest  (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  Entities that have historically presented debt issuance costs as an asset, related to a recognized debt liability, will be required to present those costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The ASU does not change the recognition, measurement, or subsequent measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. Adoption of this ASU will be applied retrospectively. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest  (Subtopic 835-30), which addresses the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU No. 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Therefore, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning with the period ended March 31, 2016. Changes to the balance sheet have been applied on a retrospective basis. This resulted in the reclassification of debt issuance costs of $10.3 million from Other assets to Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the period ended December 31, 2015. Adoption did not have a material impact on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

To be adopted in a future period: 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which creates a new topic in the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU sets forth a five step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will be required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer

Table of Contents  

at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures will be required to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014 09 by one year. The amendments are now effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and may be applied on either a full or modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of Update 2014 09 and Update 2015 14 will have on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 02,  Leases  (Topic 842). This amendment requires, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right of use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the amendments to our financial statements and accounting practices for leases. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 09,  Compensation Stock Compensation  (Topic 718). This amendment is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees, specifically in regard to (1) the income tax consequences, (2) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and (3) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our financial statements. 

3.        Acquisitions 

Merge Acquisition  

On August 18, 2016, JEH entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with SCOOP Energy Company, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, to acquire oil and gas properties located in the Merge area of the STACK/SCOOP (the  Merge ) play in Central Oklahoma (the  Merge Acquisition ). The oil and gas properties acquired in the Merge Acquisition principally consist of approximately 18,000 undeveloped net acres in Canadian, Grady and McClain Counties, Oklahoma. The Company closed the Merge Acquisition on September 22, 2016, for cash consideration of approximately $136.5 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. This transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company used proceeds from our equity offerings to fund the purchase. See Note 11,  Stockholders  and Mezzanine equity . 

Anadarko Acquisition 

On August 3, 2016, JEH LLC entered into a definitive agreement to acquire producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in the Western Anadarko Basin (the  Anadarko Acquisition ) for $27.1 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The assets acquired in the Anadarko Acquisition included interests in 174 wells, 59% of which were operated by the company, and approximately 25,000 net acres in Lipscomb and Ochiltree Counties in the Texas Panhandle, subject to reductions for exercised preferential purchase rights and failures to obtain required consents. The Company closed the Anadarko Acquisition on August 25, 2016, at which time, the acquired acreage was producing approximately 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Company allocated the entire purchase price of $27.1 million to  Oil and gas properties,  based on the respective fair values of the assets acquired. The Anadarko Acquisition did not result in a significant impact to net income and as such, pro forma financial information was not included. The Company funded the Anadarko Acquisition with cash on hand.

5.        Long-Term Debt 

Long-term debt consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Senior Unsecured Notes 

On April 1, 2014, JEH and Jones Energy Finance Corp., JEH s wholly owned subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of co-issuing certain of JEH s debt (collectively, the  Issuers ), sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Issuers  6.75% senior notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ). The Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan (as defined below) ($160.0 million), a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolver (as defined below) ($308.0 million) and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company subsequently terminated the Term Loan in accordance with its terms. The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning October 1, 2014. The 2022 Notes were registered in March 2015. 

On February 23, 2015, the Issuers sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2023 (the  2023 Notes ) in a private placement to affiliates of GSO Capital Partners LP and Magnetar Capital LLC. The 2023 Notes were issued at a discounted price equal to 94.59% of the principal amount. The Company used the $236.5 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.25% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning September 15, 2015. The 2023 Notes were registered in February 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, through several open market and privately negotiated purchases, the Company purchased an aggregate principal amount of $190.9 million of its senior unsecured notes. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had purchased $90.9 million principal amount of its 2022 Notes for $38.1 million, and $100.0 million principal amount of its 2023 Notes for $46.5 million, in each case excluding accrued interest and including any associated fees. The Company used cash on hand and borrowings from its Revolver to fund the note purchases. In conjunction with the extinguishment of this debt, JEH recognized cancellation of debt income of $99.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, on a pre-tax basis. This income is recorded in Gain on debt extinguishment on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. Of the Company s total repurchases, $20.3 million principal amount of its 2022 Notes were not cancelled and are available for future reissuance, subject to applicable securities laws. 

The 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by all of its significant subsidiaries other than the new subsidiary formed to acquire the properties in the Merge Acquisition, which is required to become a guarantor no later than January 31, 2017.

consolidate, merge or transfer all of the Company s assets, engage in transactions with affiliates or create unrestricted subsidiaries. If at any time when the 2022 Notes or 2023 Notes are rated investment grade and no default or event of default (as defined in the indenture) has occurred and is continuing, many of the foregoing covenants pertaining to the 2022 Notes or 2023 Notes, as applicable, will be suspended.

On November 6, 2014, the Company amended the Revolver to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Revolver to November 6, 2019. The Company s oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral to secure its obligations under the Revolver. The borrowing base on the Revolver was subsequently adjusted to $562.5 million in accordance with its terms as a result of the issuance of the 2023 Notes in February 2015 and was reaffirmed at this level effective April 1, 2015. Effective October 8, 2015, the borrowing base was reduced to $510.0 million during the semi-annual borrowing base re-determination.  

On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolver to, among other things (i) require that the Company's deposit accounts and securities accounts (subject to certain exclusions) become subject to control agreements, (ii) restrict the Company from borrowing or receiving Letters of Credit under the Revolver if the Company has, or, after giving effect to such borrowing or issuance of Letter of Credit, will have, a Consolidated Cash Balance (as defined in the Revolver) in excess of $30.0 million (in each case giving effect to the anticipated use of proceeds thereof) and (iii) set the borrowing base under the Revolver at $425.0 million. The borrowing base was reaffirmed at this level during the semi-annual borrowing base re-determination effective October 24, 2016. 

The terms of the Revolver require the Company to make periodic payments of interest on the loans outstanding thereunder, with all outstanding principal and interest under the Revolver due on the maturity date. The Revolver is subject to a borrowing base, which limits the amount of borrowings which may be drawn thereunder. The borrowing base will be re-determined by the lenders at least semi-annually on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year, with such re-determination based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within a short period of time.  

Interest on the Revolver is calculated, at the Company s option, at either (a) the London Interbank Offered ( LIBO ) rate for the applicable interest period plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.50% based on the level of borrowing base utilization at such time or (b) the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the one month adjusted LIBO rate plus 1.00%, or the prime rate announced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in effect on such day, in each case plus a margin of 0.50% to 1.50% based on the level of borrowing base utilization at such time. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the average interest rates under the Revolver were 2.29% and 2.38%, respectively, on average outstanding balances of $184.5 million and $170.9 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the average interest rates under the Revolver were 2.31% and 2.40%, respectively, on average outstanding balances of $100.0 million and $156.7 million, respectively. 

Total interest and commitment fees under the Revolver were $1.3 million and $4.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $1.0 million and $4.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Jones Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants under the Revolver, including the requirement to maintain the following financial ratios: 

a total leverage ratio, consisting of consolidated debt to EBITDAX, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and     

a current ratio, consisting of consolidated current assets, including the unused amounts of the total commitments, to consolidated current liabilities, of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.     

As of September 30, 2016, our total leverage ratio is approximately 3.3x and our current ratio is approximately 4.1x, as calculated based on the requirements in our covenants. We are in compliance with all terms of our Revolver at September 30, 2016. 

6.        Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in commodity prices. While the use of these instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price changes, their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price changes. Depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying supply and demand trends, we may increase or decrease our hedging positions. 

The following tables summarize our hedging positions as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Hedging Positions 

The Company recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $4.0 million and net losses of $18.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $90.5 million and $111.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The Company routinely enters into oil and natural gas swap contracts as seller, thus resulting in a fixed price. In early 2016, the Company realized certain mark-to-market gains associated with oil and natural gas hedges the Company had in place for years 2018 and 2019. The gains were effectively realized by purchasing, as opposed to   

11 

Table of Contents  

selling, oil and natural gas swap contracts for the equal volume that was associated with the initial hedge transaction. Therefore, as prices fluctuate, the loss (or gain) on any single contract in 2018 and 2019 will be offset by an equal gain (or loss). This essentially leaves the underlying production open to fluctuations in market prices. Based on current contract terms, the gains will be recognized as the hedge contracts mature in 2018 and 2019. Information related to these purchased oil and natural gas swap contracts is presented in the table above as the  offset exercise price , and the volumes in the table above are presented  net  of such purchased oil and natural gas swap contracts. 

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 

As of September 30, 2016, the counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts consisted of six financial institutions. All of our counterparties or their affiliates are also lenders under the Revolver. We are not generally required to post additional collateral under our derivative agreements. 

Our derivative agreements contain set-off provisions that state that in the event of default or early termination, any obligation owed by the defaulting party may be offset against any obligation owed to the defaulting party. 

The following table presents information about our commodity derivative contracts that are netted on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

7.        Fair Value Measurement 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company determines fair value amounts using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 

The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments, which may include over-the-counter instruments, such as natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquid contracts. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. If listed market prices or quotes are not published, fair value is determined based upon a market quote, adjusted by other market-based or independently sourced market data, such as trading volume, historical commodity volatility, and counterparty-specific considerations. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, the time value of money, and the liquidity of the market. 

Counterparty credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market price of an instrument is not indicative of the fair value as a result of the credit quality of the counterparty. Generally, market quotes assume that all counterparties have low default rates and equal credit quality. Therefore, an adjustment may be necessary to   

12 

Table of Contents  

reflect the quality of a specific counterparty to determine the fair value of the instrument. The Company currently has all derivative positions placed and held by members of its lending group, which have high credit quality. 

Liquidity valuation adjustments are necessary when the Company is not able to observe a recent market price for financial instruments that trade in less active markets. Exchange traded contracts are valued at market value without making any additional valuation adjustments; therefore, no liquidity reserve is applied. 

Valuation Hierarchy 

Fair value measurements are grouped into a three-level valuation hierarchy. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument s categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the input that requires the highest degree of judgment in the determination of the instrument s fair value. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1  Pricing inputs are based on published prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

Level 2  Pricing inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date. Contracts that are not traded on a recognized exchange or are tied to pricing transactions for which forward curve pricing is readily available are classified as Level 2 instruments. These include natural gas, crude oil and some natural gas liquids price swaps and natural gas basis swaps. 

Level 3  Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally unobservable from objective sources. The Company classifies natural gas liquid swaps and basis swaps for which future pricing is not readily available as Level 3. The Company obtains estimates from independent third parties for its open positions and subjects those to the credit adjustment criteria described above. 

The financial instruments carried at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, by consolidated balance sheet caption and by valuation hierarchy, as described above are as follows: 

(1) 

Level 3 current assets are negative as a result of the netting of our commodity derivative reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. Our agreements include set-off provisions, as noted in Note 6,  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Offsetting Assets and Liabilities .

Significant increases/decreases in natural gas liquid prices in isolation would result in a significantly lower/higher fair value measurement. The following table presents the changes in the Level 3 financial instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Changes in fair value of Level 3 instruments represent changes in gains and losses for the periods that are reported in other income (expense). New contracts entered into during the year are generally entered into at no cost with changes in fair value from the date of agreement representing the entire fair value of the instrument. Transfers between levels are evaluated at the end of the reporting period. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

The following table provides the fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements: 

The Revolver (as defined in Note 5) is categorized as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy as the debt is not publicly traded and no observable market exists to determine the fair value; however, the carrying value of the Revolver approximates fair value, as it is subject to short-term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to the Company for those periods. 

The fair value of the 2022 Notes (as defined in Note 5) is based on pricing that is readily available in the public market. Accordingly, the 2022 Notes are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is based on quoted market prices for the debt securities and is actively traded. 

14 

Table of Contents  

The fair value of the 2023 Notes (as defined in Note 5) is based on indicative pricing that is available in the public market. Accordingly, the 2023 Notes are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is based on quoted market prices for the debt securities but is not actively traded. 

The Company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment purposes by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of future cash flows used in the impairment analysis include the Company s estimate of future commodity prices, production costs, development expenditures, production, risk-adjusted discount rates, and other relevant data. As such, the fair value of oil and gas properties used in estimating impairment represents a nonrecurring Level 3 measurement. 

8.        Asset Retirement Obligations 

A summary of the Company s Asset Retirement Obligations ( ARO ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:

Includes $6.4 million related to wells acquired in the Anadarko Acquisition. See Note 3,  Acquisitions .     

9.        Stock-based Compensation 

Management Unit Awards 

Effective January 1, 2010, JEH implemented a management incentive plan that provided indirect awards of membership interests in JEH to members of senior management ( Management Units ). These awards had various vesting schedules, and a portion of the Management Units vested in a lump sum at the IPO date. In connection with the IPO, both the vested and unvested Management Units were converted into the right to receive JEH Units and shares of Class B common stock. The JEH Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) will become exchangeable under this plan into a like number of shares of Class A common stock upon vesting or forfeiture. No new Management Units have been awarded since the IPO and no new JEH Units or shares of Class B common stock are created upon a vesting event. Grants listed below reflect the transfer of JEH Units that occurred upon forfeiture. 

The following table summarizes information related to the vesting of Management Units as of September 30, 2016: 

Stock compensation expense associated with the Management Units was $0.2 million and $1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.9 million for the three

and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan 

Under the Amended and Restated Jones Energy, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  LTIP ), established in conjunction with the Company s IPO and amended on May 4, 2016 following approval by the Company s stockholders, the Company has reserved a total of 7,350,000 shares of Class A common stock for non-employee director, consultant, and employee stock-based compensation awards. 

The Company granted (i) performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards to certain officers and employees and (ii) restricted shares of Class A common stock to the Company s non-employee directors under the LTIP during 2014, 2015 and 2016. During 2016, the Company also granted performance unit awards to certain members of the senior management team under the LTIP. 

Restricted Stock Unit Awards 

The Company has outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to certain officers and employees of the Company under the LTIP. The fair value of the restricted stock unit awards is based on the value of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period, which is typically three years.  

The following table summarizes information related to the total number of units awarded to officers and employees as of September 30, 2016: 

Stock compensation expense associated with the employee restricted stock unit awards was $1.0 million and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.9 million and $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

Performance Share Unit Awards 

The Company has outstanding performance share unit awards granted to certain members of the senior management team of the Company under the LTIP. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, the performance share unit awards were described in the Company s filings as performance unit awards. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company created a new class of equity award, described below as a performance unit award, that is settled in cash rather than shares of the Company s Class A common stock. As a result, references to performance unit awards in the Company s filings prior to the second quarter of 2016 refer to this description of performance share unit awards. 

Upon the completion of the applicable three-year performance period, each recipient may vest in a number of performance share units. The percent of awarded performance share units in which each recipient vests at such time, if any, will range from 0% to 200% based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to an industry peer group over the applicable three-year performance period. Each vested performance share unit is exchangeable for one share of the Company s Class A common stock. The grant date fair value of the performance share units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which results in an estimated percentage of performance share units earned. The fair value of the performance share units is expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable three-year performance period.

Table of Contents  

The following assumptions were used for the Monte Carlo model to determine the grant date fair value and associated stock-based compensation expense of the performance share unit awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

For the performance share units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Monte Carlo simulation model resulted in approximately 69% of performance share units expected to be earned. 

The following table summarizes information related to the total number of performance share units awarded to the senior management team as of September 30, 2016: 

Stock compensation expense associated with the performance share unit awards was $0.8 million and $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.7 million and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

Performance Unit Awards 

The Company has outstanding performance unit awards, granted initially in 2016, to certain members of the senior management team of the Company under the LTIP. References to performance unit awards in prior filings do not correspond to these newly created performance unit awards. Upon the completion of the applicable three-year performance period, each recipient may vest in a number of performance units. The value of awarded performance units in which each recipient vests at such time, if any, will range from $0.0 to $200.0 per performance unit based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to an industry peer group over the applicable three-year performance period. For accounting purposes, the performance units are treated as a liability award with the liability being re-measured at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, the expense associated with these awards is subject to volatility until the payout is finally determined at the end of the performance period. The value of the performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, as of the grant date, which results in an estimated final value upon vesting of $1.3 million. The fair value measured as of September 30, 2016 was the same as the grant date value of $1.3 million. 

The following assumptions were used for the Monte Carlo model to determine the grant date fair value and associated stock-based compensation expense of the performance unit awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

For the performance units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Monte Carlo simulation model resulted in a payout of $67.38 per performance unit was expected to be earned as of the grant date. 

Stock compensation expense associated with the performance unit awards was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of September 30, 2016, $1.1 million of   

17 

Table of Contents  

unrecognized compensation expense related to the performance unit awards, subject to re-measurement and adjustment for the change in estimated final value as of the end of each reporting period, is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 2.25 years. 

Restricted Stock Awards 

The Company has outstanding restricted stock awards granted to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company under the LTIP. The restricted stock will vest upon the director serving as a director of the Company for a one-year service period in accordance with the terms of the award. The fair value of the awards was based on the price of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant. 

The following table summarizes information related to the total value of the awards to the Board of Directors as of September 30, 2016: 

Stock compensation expense associated with awards to the members of the Board of Directors was $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

10.       Income Taxes 

The Company records federal and state income tax liabilities associated with its status as a corporation. The Company recognizes a tax liability on its share of pre-tax book income, exclusive of the non-controlling interest. JEH is not subject to income tax at the federal level and only recognizes Texas franchise tax expense. 

The Company s effective tax rate was 22.6% and 20.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and 15.8% and 30.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The effective rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to net income allocated to the non-controlling interest, percentage depletion, state income taxes, and other permanent differences between book and tax accounting.  

The Company had an income tax benefit of $6.5 million and $8.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and an expense of $6.5 million and a benefit of $4.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

The following table summarizes information related to the allocation of the income tax provision between the controlling and non-controlling interests:  

The Company had deferred tax assets for its federal and state net operating loss carry forwards at September 30, 2016 recorded in its deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016, we have a valuation allowance of $2.7 million as a result of management s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets in Oklahoma. Management believes that there will be sufficient future

taxable income based on the reversal of temporary differences to enable utilization of substantially all other tax carryforwards.  

Tax Receivable Agreement 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had recorded a Tax Receivable Agreement ( TRA ) liability of $43.2 million and $38.1 million net of valuation allowance, respectively, for the estimated payments that will be made to the pre-IPO members who have exchanged JEH Units (and shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock. Such exchanges generated tax basis increases leading to deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $50.6 million and $44.8 million, respectively, net of valuation allowance. The amount of the TRA liability was increased by $5.3 million and $5.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as a result of exchanges that have occurred year to date. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the TRA liability increase has been offset by $0.1 and $0.3 million, respectively, as a result of the valuation allowance recorded against the Company s deferred tax assets. Of the change, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, has been included in other income (expense) on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations with the remainder recorded against equity. To the extent the Company does not realize all of the tax benefits in future years or in the event of a change in future tax rates, this liability may change. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not made any payments under the TRA to pre-IPO members who have exchanged JEH Units and Class B common stock for Class A common stock. 

Cash Tax Distributions 

The holders of JEH Units, including Jones Energy, Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their share of any taxable income of JEH. Under the terms of its operating agreement, JEH is generally required to make quarterly pro-rata cash tax distributions to its unitholders (including us) based on income allocated to its unitholders through the end of each relevant quarter, as adjusted to take into account good faith projections by the Company of taxable income or loss for the remainder of the calendar year, to the extent JEH has cash available for such distributions and subject to certain other restrictions. 

A Special Committee of the Board of Directors comprised solely of directors who do not have a direct or indirect interest in such distribution approved, and JEH made, aggregate cash tax distributions of $20.0 million to its unitholders towards its total 2016 projected tax distribution obligation. The distributions were made with respect to the first and second quarters of 2016, pro-rata to all members of JEH, and included a $9.9 million payment to the Company. The 2016 tax distributions are the result of taxable income generated by our operations and debt extinguishment. 

11.      Stockholders  and Mezzanine equity 

Stockholders  equity is comprised of two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The Class B common stock is held by the owners of JEH prior to the Company s IPO and can be exchanged (together with a corresponding number of units representing membership interests in JEH Units) for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. The Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holders to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Company s stockholders generally. 

The Company has classified the Series A preferred stock as mezzanine equity based upon the terms and conditions that contain various redemption and conversion features. For a description of these features, please see below under   Offering of 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock.  

Equity Distribution Agreement 

On May 24, 2016, the Company and Jones Energy Holdings, LLC entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement ( Equity Distribution Agreement ) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (each, a

Manager  and collectively, the  Managers ). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through the Managers, as the Company s sales agents, the Company s Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $73.0 million (the  Class A Shares ). Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may also sell Class A Shares from time to time to any Manager as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of Class A Shares to a Manager as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between the Company and such Manager. Sales of the Class A Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a  dark pool  or any similar market venue, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and one or more of the Managers. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately 0.5 million Class A Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million ($2.1 million gross proceeds, net of approximately $0.3 million in commissions and professional services expenses). The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2016, approximately $70.9 million in aggregate offering proceeds remained available to be issued and sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement. 

Offering of Class A Common Stock 

On August 19, 2016, the Company and JEH LLC entered into an underwriting agreement (the  Common Stock Underwriting Agreement ) with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (the  Common Stock Underwriters ), with respect to the offer and sale of 21,000,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Class A Common Stock ). The Common Stock Underwriting Agreement also provided the Common Stock Underwriters an option (the  Common Stock Option ) to purchase an additional 3,150,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the  Additional Offering ) within 30 days of the date of the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement. On September 7, 2016, the Underwriters exercised the Common Stock Option in full. The total net proceeds from the offering of Class A Common Stock (after underwriters  compensation, but before estimated expenses) pursuant to the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement, including the exercise of the Common Stock Option, was $64.0 million. The Class A Common Stock was issued pursuant to the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-211568), which became effective July 26, 2016, and a prospectus, which consists of a base prospectus, dated as of July 26, 2016, and a prospectus supplement, dated August 19, 2016. The closing of the sale of Class A Common Stock occurred on August 26, 2016 and the Additional Offering closed on September 12, 2016. 

Offering of 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock 

On August 19, 2016, the Company and JEH LLC entered into an underwriting agreement (the  Preferred Stock Underwriting Agreement ) with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the  Preferred Stock Underwriters ) with respect to the offer and sale of 1,600,000 shares of the Series A preferred stock. The Preferred Stock Underwriting Agreement also provided the Preferred Stock Underwriters an option (the  Preferred Stock Option ) to purchase an additional 240,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, which was exercised in full. The total net proceeds from the offering of Series A preferred stock (after underwriters  compensation, but before estimated expenses) pursuant to the Preferred Stock Underwriting Agreement, including the exercise of the Preferred Stock Option, was $88.3 million. The Series A preferred stock was issued pursuant to the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-211568), which became effective July 26, 2016, and an additional registration statement with respect thereto on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-213201) filed under Rule 462(b) of the Act, which became effective upon filing on August 19, 2016. The closing of the sale of Series A preferred stock occurred on August 26, 2016. 

Holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive, when as and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors, cumulative dividends at the rate of 8.0% per annum (the  dividend rate ) per share on the $50.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2016. Dividends may be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in Class A common stock, or a combination thereof.

Under the terms of the Series A preferred stock, the Company s ability to declare or pay dividends or make distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of the Company s Class A common stock, or any junior stock or parity stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, will be subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not pay in full or declare and set aside for payment in full all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A preferred stock (including certain unpaid excess cash payment amounts excused from payment as a dividend due to restrictions in credit facilities or other indebtedness or legal requirements ( Unpaid Excess Cash Payment Amounts )). 

Each share of Series A preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $50.00 per share and is convertible, at the holder s option at any time, initially into approximately 15.6961 shares of Class A common stock (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $3.19 per share), subject to specified adjustments and limitations as set forth in the certificate of designations for the Series A preferred stock. Based on the initial conversion rate and the full exercise of the Preferred Stock Underwriters  over-allotment option, approximately 28.9 million shares of Class A common stock would be issuable upon conversion of all the Series A preferred stock. 

On or after August 15, 2021, the Company may, at its option, give notice of its election to cause all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock at the conversion rate, if the closing sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds 175% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days.  

On August 15, 2024 (the  designated redemption date ), each holder of Series A preferred stock may require us to redeem any or all Series A preferred stock held by such holder outstanding on the designated redemption date at a redemption price equal to a liquidation preference of $50.00 per share plus all accrued dividends on the shares up to but excluding the designated redemption date that have not been paid plus any Unpaid Excess Cash Payment Amounts (the  redemption price ). At our option, the redemption price may be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in Class A common stock, or a combination thereof.  

Except as required by law or the Company s certificate of incorporation, which includes the certificate of designations for the Series A preferred stock, the holders of Series A preferred stock have no voting rights (other than with respect to certain matters regarding the Series A preferred stock or when dividends payable on the Series A preferred stock have not been paid for an aggregate of six quarterly dividend periods, or more, whether or not consecutive, as provided in the certificate of designations for the Series A preferred stock).  

The Series A preferred stock is classified as mezzanine equity on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Mezzanine equity consisted of the following at September 30, 2016: 

12.      Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Shares of Class B common stock are not included in the calculation of earnings per share because they are not participating securities and have no economic interest in the Company. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilutive effect of shares that could be issued by the Company in conjunction with the Series A preferred stock and from stock awards that have been granted to directors and employees. Awards of nonvested shares are considered outstanding as of the respective grant dates for purposes of computing diluted EPS even though the award is contingent upon vesting. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016, 1,274,611 restricted stock units, 1,035,205 performance share units, and 28,880,824 shares from the convertible Class A preferred stock, were excluded from the calculation as they would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

The following is a calculation of the basic and diluted weighted-average number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding and EPS: 

The sum of the quarterly earnings (loss) per share amounts differ from the total earnings (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the change in weighted-average shares outstanding. 

13.      Related Parties 

Related Party Transactions 

Transactions with Our Executive Officers, Directors and 5% Stockholders 

On May 7, 2013, the Company entered into a natural gas sale and purchase agreement with Monarch Natural Gas, LLC, ( Monarch ), under which Monarch has the first right to gather the natural gas the Company produces from dedicated properties, process the NGLs from this natural gas production and market the processed natural gas and extracted NGLs. Effective May 1, 2015, the rights to gather natural gas under the sale and purchase agreement transferred from Monarch to Enable Midstream Partners LP ( Enable ), an unaffiliated third party. Therefore, no related party revenue relating to natural gas and NGL production was recognized during 2016 associated with the aforementioned agreement. The initial term of the agreement, which remains unchanged by the transfer to Enable, runs for 10 years from the effective date of September 1, 2013. 

At the time the Company entered into the 2013 Monarch agreement, Metalmark Capital owned approximately 81% of the outstanding equity interests of Monarch. In addition, Metalmark Capital beneficially owns in excess of five percent of the Company s outstanding equity interests and two of our directors, Howard I. Hoffen and Gregory D. Myers, are managing directors of Metalmark Capital. 

In connection with the Company s entering into the 2013 Monarch agreement, Monarch issued to JEH equity interests in Monarch, having an estimated fair value of $15.0 million, in return for marketing services to be provided throughout the term of the agreement. The Company recorded this amount as deferred revenue which is being amortized on an estimated units-of-production basis commencing in September 2013, the first month of product sales to Monarch. The Company amortized $0.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of the deferred revenue balance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This revenue is included in other revenues on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

In September 2014, the Company signed a 10 year oil gathering and transportation agreement with Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC, pursuant to which Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC built, at its expense, a new oil gathering system and

Table of Contents  

connected the gathering system to dedicated Company leases in Texas. At the time the Company entered into the agreement, Metalmark Capital owned the majority of the outstanding equity interests of Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC and/or its parent. The system began service during the fourth quarter of 2015 and provides connectivity to both a regional refinery market as well as the Cushing market hub. The Company incurred gathering fees, which were paid to Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC, of $0.7 million and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, associated with the approximately 0.3 MMBoe and 1.0 MMBoe of oil production transported under the agreement. These costs are recorded as an offset to Oil and gas sales in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The aforementioned production was recognized as Oil and gas sales on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations at the time it was sold to the purchasers, who are unaffiliated third parties, after passing through the gathering and transportation system. 

Purchase of Senior Unsecured Notes 

On February 29, 2016, JEH and Jones Energy Finance Corp. purchased $50.0 million principal amount of their outstanding 2023 Notes from investment funds managed by Magnetar Capital and its affiliates, which investment funds collectively own more than 5% of a class of voting securities of the Company, for approximately $23.3 million excluding accrued interest and including any associated fees. On the same day, JEH and Jones Energy Finance Corp. purchased an additional $50.0 million principal amount of their outstanding 2023 Notes from investment funds managed by Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and its affiliates, which investment funds collectively own more than 5% of a class of voting securities of the Company, for approximately $23.3 million excluding accrued interest and including any associated fees. In conjunction with the extinguishment of this $100.0 million principal amount of debt, JEH recognized cancellation of debt income of $48.3 million on a pre-tax basis. This income is recorded in Gain on debt extinguishment on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

14.      Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. When applicable, we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits are expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. 

In an action filed on June 12, 2015 in the 31  st   District Court of Hemphill County, Texas,   Donna Kim Flowers and Mitchell Kirk Flowers v. Jones Energy, LLC f/k/a Jones Energy Limited, LLC f/k/a Jones Energy, Ltd.   (Case No. 7225), the Company was sued by Donna Kim Flowers and Mitchell Kirk Flowers (the  plaintiffs ). The plaintiffs own surface rights to property located in Hemphill County, Texas. The mineral rights are leased to third parties, and the Company is the operator of the Oil and Gas Mineral Lease. On May 28, 2010, the plaintiffs and the Company entered into a Surface Use Agreement concerning the Company s fracking operations on the property, which require the Company to minimize disruption and damage to the plaintiffs  surface rights. The plaintiffs allege that the Company is in breach of such contract, and seek monetary damages. In June 2016, the Company presented a settlement offer to the plaintiffs. As a result of this settlement offer, the Company has accrued $1.5 million related to its estimated obligation under this settlement offer. This accrual was included in accrued liabilities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016, and the charge was recorded as general and administrative expense on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. However, no certainty exists that a settlement will be reached or if so, the amount of any such settlement. Therefore, the ultimate loss could be greater or less than the amount accrued. In the event the plaintiffs and the Company are not able to reach a settlement, a court date has been set for May 30, 2017. 

15.      Subsequent Events 

Preferred Stock Dividend Declared 

On October 18, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a prorated quarterly cash dividend per share equal to 8.0% based on the liquidation preference of $50.00 per share on an annualized basis, or approximately $0.8777778 per share, on the Company s 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock. This dividend is

Table of Contents  

prorated for the period beginning on the issue date of August 26, 2016 through November 14, 2016 and will be payable in cash on November 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2016. 

Borrowing Base Redetermination 

Availability under the Revolver is subject to a borrowing base. The borrowing base is re-determined at least semi-annually on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year, with such re-determination based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time. Our borrowing base at September 30, 2016 was $425.0 million. The borrowing base was reaffirmed at this level during the semi-annual borrowing base re-determination effective October 24, 2016. 

16.      Subsidiary Guarantors  

On April 1, 2014, the Issuers sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. On February 23, 2015, the Issuers sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. 

The 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by all of JEH s current subsidiaries (except Jones Energy Finance Corp., two immaterial subsidiaries and the new subsidiary formed to acquire the properties in the Merge Acquisition, which is required to become a guarantor no later than January 31, 2017) and certain future subsidiaries, including any future subsidiaries that guarantee any indebtedness under the Revolver. Each subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by JEH, and all guarantees are full and unconditional, subject to customary exceptions pursuant to the indentures governing our 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes, as discussed below, and joint and several with all other subsidiary guarantees and the parent guarantee. Any subsidiaries of JEH other than the subsidiary guarantors and Jones Energy Finance Corp. are immaterial. 

Guarantees of the 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes will be released under certain circumstances, including (i) in connection with any sale or other disposition of (a) all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) or (b) all of the capital stock of such guarantor, in each case, to a person that is not the Company or a restricted subsidiary of the Company, (ii) if the Company designates any restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, (iii) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the applicable indenture, or (iv) at such time as such guarantor ceases to guarantee any other indebtedness of the Company or any other guarantor. 

The Company is a holding company whose sole material asset is an equity interest in JEH. The Company is the sole managing member of JEH and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions related to JEH s business. In accordance with JEH s limited liability company agreement, the Company may not be removed as the sole managing member of JEH. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company held 56,969,222 JEH Units and all of the preferred units representing membership interests in JEH, and the remaining 29,872,426 JEH Units are held by a group of investors that owned interests in JEH prior to the Company s IPO (the  Pre-IPO Owners ). The Pre-IPO Owners have no voting rights with respect to their economic interest in JEH. 

The Company has two classes of common stock, Class A common stock, which was sold to investors in the IPO, and Class B common stock, and one series of preferred stock, Series A preferred stock. Pursuant to the Company s certificate of incorporation, each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share, and the shares of Class A common stock are entitled to 100% of the economic interests in the Company. Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights in the Company, but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Company s stockholders generally. Except as required by law or the Company s certificate of incorporation, which includes the certificate of designations for the Series A preferred stock, the holders of Series A preferred stock have no voting rights (other than with respect to certain matters regarding the Series A preferred stock or when dividends payable on the Series A preferred stock have not been paid for an aggregate of six quarterly dividend periods, or more, whether or not consecutive, as provided in the certificate of designations for the Series A preferred stock). 

In connection with a reorganization that occurred immediately prior to the IPO, each Existing Owner was issued a number of shares of Class B common stock that was equal to the number of JEH Units that such Existing Owner held. Holders of the Company s Class A common stock and Class B common stock generally vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the Company s stockholders for their vote or approval.

Table of Contents  

Accordingly, the Pre-IPO Owners collectively have a number of votes in the Company equal to the aggregate number of JEH Units that they hold. 

The Pre-IPO Owners have the right, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agreement by and among the Company, JEH and each of the Pre-IPO Owners (the  Exchange Agreement ), to exchange their JEH Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. As a result, the Company expects that over time the Company will have an increasing economic interest in JEH as Class B common stock and JEH Units are exchanged for Class A common stock. Moreover, any transfers of JEH Units outside of the Exchange Agreement (other than permitted transfers to affiliates) must be approved by the Company. The Company intends to retain full voting and management control over JEH.

Overview 

We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the mid-continent United States, spanning areas of Texas and Oklahoma. Our Chairman and CEO, Jonny Jones, founded our predecessor company in 1988 in continuation of his family s long history in the oil and gas business, which dates back to the 1920 s. We have grown rapidly by leveraging our focus on low cost drilling and completion methods and our horizontal drilling expertise to develop our inventory and execute several strategic acquisitions. We have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in developing the Anadarko and Arkoma basins, having concentrated our operations in the Anadarko basin for over 25 years and applied our knowledge to the Arkoma basin since 2011. We have drilled over 850 total wells as operator, including over 675 horizontal wells, since our formation and delivered compelling rates of return over various commodity price cycles. Our operations are focused on horizontal drilling and completions within three distinct areas in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma: 

the Western Anadarko Basin targeting the liquids rich Cleveland, Granite Wash, Tonkawa and Marmaton formations;      

Merge area of the STACK/SCOOP (the  Merge ) in the Eastern Anadarko Basin targeting the liquids rich Woodford shale and Sycamore formations; and     

the Arkoma Basin targeting the Woodford shale formation.     

We seek to optimize returns through a disciplined emphasis on controlling costs and promoting operational efficiencies, and we are recognized as one of the lowest cost drilling and completion operators in the Cleveland and Woodford shale formations. 

Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2016 Highlights: 

Completed two acquisitions in the third quarter of 2016, including transformative $136.5 million Merge Acquisition and bolt-on $26.3 million (net of closing adjustments) Anadarko Acquisition     

Raised $152.3 million in net proceeds from common stock and convertible preferred stock issuance     

Expect to deploy first rig on the properties acquired in the Merge Acquisition in December 2016     

Increasing full year 2016 capital guidance to $110.0 million, primarily due to higher average working interest associated with Cleveland development program and expected Merge leasing     

Borrowing base maintained at $425.0 million as a result of fall redetermination

Acquisitions 

Merge Acquisition 

On August 18, 2016, JEH entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with SCOOP Energy Company, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, to acquire oil and gas properties located in the Merge area of the STACK/SCOOP (the  Merge ) play in Central Oklahoma (the  Merge Acquisition ). The oil and gas properties to be acquired in the Merge Acquisition principally consist of approximately 18,000 undeveloped net acres in Canadian, Grady and McClain Counties, Oklahoma. The Company closed the Merge Acquisition on September 22, 2016, for a closing price of approximately $136.5 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The Company used proceeds from our equity offerings to fund the purchase. 

Anadarko Acquisition 

On August 3, 2016, JEH LLC entered into a definitive agreement to acquire producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in the Western Anadarko Basin (the  Anadarko Acquisition ) for $27.1 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The assets acquired in the Anadarko Acquisition included interests in 174 wells, 59% of which were operated by the company, and approximately 25,000 net acres in Lipscomb and Ochiltree Counties in the Texas Panhandle, subject to reductions for exercised preferential purchase rights and failures to obtain required consents. The Company closed the Anadarko Acquisition on August 25, 2016, at which time, the acquired acreage was producing approximately 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Company funded the Anadarko Acquisition with cash on hand. 

Updated Capital Expenditures Outlook 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company spent $29.3 million on capital expenditures excluding acquisitions, of which $28.4 million was drilling and completion capital and the remainder was related to maintenance capital and spending on non-operated wells, bringing total year-to-date 2016 capital expenditures excluding acquisitions to $53.1 million. The Company spent $163.6 million on acquisitions in the third quarter, bringing total capital expenditures including acquisitions for the third quarter of 2016 to $192.9 million and year-to-date capital expenditures including acquisitions to $216.7 million. The $163.6 million in capital spent on acquisitions includes the $136.5 million Merge Acquisition and the $26.3 million Anadarko Acquisition, which were both completed in the third quarter of 2016. On November 3, 2016, the Company announced a further revised 2016 capital expenditures program, increasing full year 2016 guidance (excluding acquisitions) to $110.0 million primarily due to higher average working interest associated with Cleveland development program and expected Merge leasing.

Non-GAAP financial measures 

EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. 

We define EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense, gains and losses from derivatives less the current period settlements of matured derivative contracts and the other items described below. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes EBITDAX is useful because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. EBITDAX has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. Our presentation of EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Our computations of EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDAX for the periods indicated: 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company s consolidated financial statements. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding the impact of certain non-cash items including gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments not yet settled, impairment of oil and gas properties, non-cash compensation expense, and the other items described below. We define Adjusted Earnings per Share as earnings per share plus that portion of the components of adjusted net income allocated to the controlling interests divided by weighted average shares outstanding. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items for which the timing or amount cannot be

reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our computations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

In arriving at adjusted net income, the tax impact of the adjustments to net income is determined by applying the appropriate tax rate to each adjustment and then allocating the tax impact between the controlling and non-controlling interests.

Results of Operations - Three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 

Operating revenues 

Oil and gas sales.   Oil and gas sales decreased $13.9 million, or 29.9%, to $32.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $46.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to the decline in production volumes ($14.1 million), which was offset by a slight increase in commodity prices ($0.2 million). The decrease in production volumes was driven by the temporary suspension of our drilling program. The average realized oil price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $42.74 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $39.94 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 6.6%. The average realized natural gas price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, increased from $1.95 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.08 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 6.7%. The average realized natural gas liquids price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, increased from $11.37 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $13.09 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 15.1%. Average daily production decreased 26.3% to 18,609 Boe per day for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 25,261 Boe per day for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Costs and expenses 

Lease operating.   Lease operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million, or 11.2%, to $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was principally attributable to reduction in post-completion costs driven by a temporary suspension of the drilling program, operational focus on reducing recurring operating expenses, such as optimizing the usage of compressors and rental equipment, and vendor price reductions. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses increased $0.77 per Boe, or 20.2%, from $3.82 per Boe in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $4.59 per Boe in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Production and ad valorem taxes.   Production and ad valorem taxes decreased by $0.8 million, or 32.0%, to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was driven by a $0.3 million (16.7%) reduction in production taxes, which decreased in conjunction with the 29.9% decrease in oil and gas revenue. Production tax rates vary between states, products, and production levels; therefore, the overall blended rate is impacted by numerous factors and the mix of producing wells at any given time. Additionally, estimated ad valorem taxes decreased $0.5 million from $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting lower property assessments due to lower commodity prices. The average effective rate excluding the impact of ad valorem taxes increased from 4.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Exploration.   Exploration expense decreased from $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recognized charges for lease abandonment of $0.9 million relating to certain leases that the Company decided during the third quarter of 2016 not to develop. No exploratory wells resulted in exploration expense during either year. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization.   Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased by $16.2 million, or 30.7%, to $36.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $52.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of lower production caused by a reduction in capital spending driven by a temporary suspension of the drilling program. On a per unit basis, depletion expense decreased $1.35 per Boe or 5.9% from $22.70 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $21.35 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

General and administrative.   General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.2 million, or 33.3%, to $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to staff and other cost reductions. Non-cash compensation expense increased $0.3 million from $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. On a per unit basis, general and administrative

expenses, excluding non-cash items, decreased from $3.04 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.30 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest expense.   Interest expense decreased by $3.9 million, or 23.4%, to $12.8 million for three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was driven by a reduction in the outstanding balance of the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes as a result of our debt extinguishments. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a weighted average rate of 2.29%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. Average outstanding balances for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $184.5 million, $409.1 million and $150.0 million under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes, respectively. 

Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives.   The net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives was a net gain of $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net gain of $90.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gain was primarily driven by lower average crude oil prices ($44.85 per barrel) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the crude oil prices as of June 30, 2016 ($45.46 per barrel). 

Other income (expense).   Other income (expense) decreased by $0.4 million to net income of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net expense of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to an increase in the TRA valuation allowance which resulted in income of $0.3 million. 

Income taxes.   The provision for federal and state income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a benefit of $6.5 million resulting in a 22.6% effective tax rate as a percentage of our pre-tax book income for the quarter as compared to an expense of $6.5 million resulting in a 15.8% effective tax rate as a percentage of our pre-tax book income for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our effective tax rate is based on the statutory rate applicable to the U.S. and the blended rate of the states in which we conduct business and is adjusted from the enacted rates for the share of net income allocated to the non-controlling interest. See Note 10,  Income Taxes,  for further details. 

Results of Operations - Nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Operating revenues 

Oil and gas sales.   Oil and gas sales decreased $70.9 million, or 45.2%, to $86.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $157.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to the decline in commodity prices ($34.1 million), as well as decreased production volumes ($36.8 million). The decrease in production volumes was driven by the temporary suspension of our drilling program. The average realized oil price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $46.10 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $35.59 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 22.8%. The average realized natural gas price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $2.03 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.50 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 26.1%. The average realized natural gas liquids price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $13.59 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $11.99 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 11.8%. Average daily production decreased 25.2% to 19,193 Boe per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 25,659 Boe per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Costs and expenses 

Lease operating.   Lease operating expenses decreased by $8.9 million, or 27.1%, to $24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $32.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was principally attributable to reduction in post-completion costs driven by a temporary suspension of the drilling program, operational focus on reducing recurring operating expenses, such as optimizing the usage of compressors and rental equipment, and vendor price reductions. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses decreased $0.13 per Boe, or 2.8%, from $4.70 per Boe in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $4.57 per Boe in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Production and ad valorem taxes.   Production and ad valorem taxes decreased by $4.2 million, or 45.2%, to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was driven by a $2.7 million (39.7%) reduction in production taxes, which decreased in conjunction with the 45.2% decrease in oil and gas revenue. Production tax rates vary between states, products, and production levels; therefore, the overall blended rate is impacted by numerous factors and the mix of producing wells at any given time. Additionally, estimated ad valorem taxes decreased $1.5 million from $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting lower property assessments due to lower commodity prices. The average effective rate excluding the impact of ad valorem taxes increased from 4.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Exploration.   Exploration expense decreased from $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recognized charges for lease abandonment of $0.9 million relating to certain leases that the Company decided during 2016 not to develop. The remaining spending during 2016 primarily related to geological data and seismic processing associated with unproved acreage. No exploratory wells resulted in exploration expense during either year. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization.   Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased by $39.7 million, or 25.5%, to $116.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $156.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of lower production caused by a reduction in capital spending driven by a temporary suspension of the drilling program. On a per unit basis, depletion expense decreased $0.15 per Boe or 0.7% from $22.29 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $22.14 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

General and administrative.   General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.5 million, or 19.9%, to $22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to staff and other cost reductions. Non-cash compensation expense increased $0.3 million from $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash items, decreased from $2.97 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.85 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other operating expense.   Other operating expense decreased from $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to none for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 represents stand-by rig costs associated with the early termination of drilling rig contracts. There were no similar charges during 2016. 

Interest expense.   Interest expense decreased by $7.2 million, or 15.1%, to $40.4 million for nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $47.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was driven by a reduction in the outstanding balance of the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes as a result of our debt extinguishments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a weighted average rate of 2.38%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. Average outstanding balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $170.9 million, $424.1 million and $171.9 million under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes, respectively. 

Gain on debt extinguishment.   The gain on debt extinguishment of $99.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was related to the purchase of an aggregate principal amount of $190.9 million of our senior unsecured notes for cash of $84.6 million. The company recognized accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.7 million associated with the cancellation. See Note 5,  Long-Term Debt,  for further details regarding the debt extinguishment. There were no similar gains during 2015. 

Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives.   The net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives was a net loss of $18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net gain of $111.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The loss was driven by higher average crude oil and natural gas prices ($41.35 per barrel and $2.34 per Mcf, respectively) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the crude oil and natural gas prices as of December 31, 2015 ($37.13 per barrel and $2.28 per Mcf, respectively), as well as additional hedging activity during 2016.

Other income (expense).   Other income (expense) decreased by $1.9 million to net income of $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net expense of $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to an increase in the TRA valuation allowance which resulted in income of $0.4 million, offset by financing costs which resulted in expenses of $0.3 million. Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to financing costs resulted in expenses of $2.4 million, partially offset by the receipt of a $0.7 million distribution of dividend income from our investment in Monarch Natural Gas Holdings, LLC. 

Income taxes.   The provision for federal and state income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a benefit of $8.2 million resulting in a 20.2% effective tax rate as a percentage of our pre-tax book income year-to-date as compared to a benefit of $4.6 million with a 30.1% effective tax rate as a percentage of our pre-tax book income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our effective tax rate is based on the statutory rate applicable to the U.S. and the blended rate of the states in which we conduct business and is adjusted from the enacted rates for the share of net income allocated to the non-controlling interest. The change in effective tax rate was due primarily to the percentage of income allocated to the non-controlling interest and the impact of a change in enacted state tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. See Note 10,  Income Taxes,  for further details. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been private and public sales of our debt and equity, borrowings under bank credit facilities and cash flows from operations. Our primary use of capital has been for the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties. As we pursue reserves and production growth, we continually consider which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. We strive to maintain financial flexibility in order to maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our Revolver (as defined below), facilitate drilling on our undeveloped acreage positions and permit us to selectively expand our acreage positions. Depending on the timing and concentration of the development of our non-proved locations, we may be required to generate or raise significant amounts of capital to develop all of our potential drilling locations should we endeavor to do so. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending. Our balance sheet at September 30, 2016 reflects a positive working capital balance largely due to the value of our current commodity derivative assets as of this date. We have historically and in the future expect to maintain a negative working capital balance, and we use our Revolver to help manage our working capital. 

Availability under the Revolver is subject to a borrowing base. Our borrowing base at September 30, 2016 was $425.0 million of which $143.0 million was utilized leaving an unused capacity of $282.0 million. The borrowing base was reaffirmed at this level during the semi-annual borrowing base re-determination effective October 24, 2016. The borrowing base will be re-determined at least semi-annually on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year, with such re-determination based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under our Revolver exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within a short period of time. 

The Revolver also contains a covenant which restricts the ability of Jones Energy, Inc. to (i) hold any assets, (ii) incur, create, assume, or suffer to exist any debt or any other liability or obligation, (iii) create, make or enter into any investment or (iv) engage in any other activity or operation other than, among other exceptions described therein, its ownership of equity interests in JEH and the activities of a passive holding company and assets and operations incidental thereto (including the maintenance of cash and reserves for the payment of operational costs and expenses). 

Jones Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are also required under the Revolver to maintain the following financial ratios: 

a total leverage ratio, consisting of consolidated debt to EBITDAX, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and     

43 

Table of Contents  

a current ratio, consisting of consolidated current assets, including the unused amounts of the total commitments, to consolidated current liabilities, of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.     

As of September 30, 2016, our total leverage ratio is approximately 3.3x and our current ratio is approximately 4.1x, as calculated based on the requirements in our covenants. We are in compliance with all terms of our Revolver at September 30, 2016, and we expect to maintain compliance throughout 2016. However, factors including those outside of our control, such as commodity price declines, may prevent us from maintaining compliance with these covenants, at future measurement dates in 2016 and beyond. In the event it were to become necessary, we believe we have the ability to take actions that would prevent us from failing to comply with our covenants, such as hedge restructuring. If an event of default exists under the Revolver, the lenders will be able to accelerate the obligations outstanding under the Revolver and exercise other rights and remedies. Our Revolver contains customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the Revolver. 

The Company routinely enters into oil and natural gas swap contracts as seller, thus resulting in a fixed price. As of October 28, 2016, the estimated mark-to-market value of the Company s total hedge portfolio was approximately $96.8 million, incorporating strip pricing but excluding adjustments for credit risk. In early 2016, the Company realized certain mark-to-market gains associated with oil and natural gas hedges the Company had in place for years 2018 and 2019. The gains were effectively realized by purchasing, as opposed to selling, oil and natural gas swap contracts for the equal volume that was associated with the initial hedge transaction. Based on current contract terms, the gains will be recognized as the hedge contracts mature in 2018 and 2019. The estimated mark-to-market value of the Company s realized gains as a result of these offsetting hedges were approximately $38.7 million and $8.4 million relating to the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively, incorporating strip pricing as of October 28, 2016, but excluding adjustments for credit risk. 

Our capital budget is primarily focused on the development of the Cleveland formation through exploitation and development, with spending to begin development of the recently acquired Merge acreage occurring late in the fourth quarter of 2016. The amount of capital we expend may fluctuate materially based on the market conditions for commodity prices and costs of drilling and completing wells, the economic returns being realized and the success of our drilling results as the year progresses. 

On May 24, 2016, the Company and Jones Energy Holdings, LLC entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (each, a  Manager  and collectively, the  Managers ). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through the Managers, as the Company s sales agents, the Company s Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $73.0 million (the  Class A Shares ). Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may also sell Class A Shares from time to time to any Manager as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of Class A Shares to a Manager as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between the Company and such Manager. Sales of the Class A Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a  dark pool  or any similar market venue, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and one or more of the Managers. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately 0.5 million Class A Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million ($2.1 million gross proceeds, net of approximately $0.3 million in commissions and professional services expenses). The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2016, approximately $70.9 million in aggregate offering price remained available to be issued and sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement. 

The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within management s control. If oil and gas prices decline to levels below our acceptable levels or costs increase to levels above our acceptable levels, we may choose to defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods in order to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and to prioritize capital projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate near-term cash flow. We may also increase our capital expenditures significantly to take advantage of opportunities we consider to be attractive. We continuously monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing,

drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the availability of rigs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control. 

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Cash flow provided by operating activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $89.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to the $70.9 million decrease in oil and gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, driven by declines in production volumes as a result of the temporary suspension of the drilling program, as well as declines in commodity prices. 

Cash flow (used in) investing activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was $104.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $177.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in investing cash flow was primarily driven by the reduction in capital spending, resulting from a temporary suspension of the drilling program. 

Cash flow provided by financing activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $92.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $97.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in financing cash flows was primarily due to the purchase of an aggregate principal amount of $190.9 million of our senior unsecured notes for cash of $84.6 million. The Company used cash on hand and borrowings from its Revolver to fund the note purchases. Additionally, we paid cash tax distributions of approximately $10.1 million to Pre-IPO Owners. Borrowings under the Revolver, net of repayments, totaled $33.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash flows provided by financing activities were also impacted by net equity offerings of $153.8 million.  

Contractual Obligations 

The holders of JEH Units, including Jones Energy, Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their share of any taxable income of JEH. Under the terms of its operating agreement, JEH is generally required to make quarterly pro-rata cash tax distributions to its unitholders (including us) based on income allocated to its unitholders through the end of each relevant quarter, as adjusted to take into account good faith projections by the Company of taxable income or loss for the remainder of the calendar year, to the extent JEH has cash available for such distributions and subject to certain other restrictions. 

Based on information available as of this filing, we estimate that the total amount of tax distributions to JEH unitholders in 2016 will be approximately $46.4 million, including the approximately $20.0 million that has been paid to date. The tax distributions are made pro-rata to all holders of JEH Units, and would result in a $27.6 million distribution made to the Company, and an $18.8 million distribution made to Pre-IPO Owners. The 2016 tax distributions to date were the result of taxable income generated by our operations and debt extinguishment, and our current projections do not currently lead us to anticipate payment of such tax distribution obligations beyond the current year.  

There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure  s about Market Risk 

The following market risk disclosures should be read in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Quarterly Report. 

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial statements that arise in the normal course of business. We may enter into derivative instruments to manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative agreements for speculative purposes. We do not designate these or future derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized currently in earnings. 

Potential Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties 

Oil and natural gas prices are inherently volatile and have decreased significantly since 2014. Depressed commodity prices have continued into 2016, and historically low commodity prices may exist for an extended period. In applying the prescribed impairment test under the successful efforts method at September 30, 2016, no impairment charge was indicated. 

Our revenues and net income are sensitive to crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices which have been and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. The recent volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices increases the uncertainty as to the impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves. Although we are unable to predict future commodity prices, a prolonged period of depressed commodity prices may have a significant impact on the volumetric quantities of our proved reserves. The impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves can be illustrated as follows: if the prices used for our December 31, 2015 Reserve Report had been replaced with the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for the applicable commodity for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, 2016 (without regard to our commodity derivative positions and without assuming any change in development plans, costs, or other variables), then estimated proved reserves volumes as of December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately 2.6%. The use of this pricing example is for illustration purposes only, and does not indicate management s view on future commodity prices, costs or other variables, or represent a forecast or estimate of the actual amount by which our proved reserves may fluctuate when a full assessment of our reserves is completed as of December 31, 2016. 

Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and related future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including changes in oil and natural gas prices, reservoir performance, new drilling and completion, purchases, sales and terminations of leases, drilling and operating cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. All of these factors are inherently estimates and are inter dependent. While each variable carries its own degree of uncertainty, some factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, have historically been highly volatile and may be highly volatile in the future. This high degree of volatility causes a high degree of uncertainty associated with the estimation of reserve quantities and estimated future cash flows. Therefore, future results are highly uncertain and subject to potentially significant revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions, as such revisions could be negatively impacted by: 

Declines in commodity prices or actual realized prices below those assumed for future years;     

Increases in service costs;     

46 

Table of Contents  

Increases in future global or regional production or decreases in demand;     

Increases in operating costs;     

Reductions in availability of drilling, completion, or other equipment.     

If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in an impairment of assets that may be material. Any future impairments are difficult to predict, and although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments at this time, such impairments may be significant. 

Commodity price risk and hedges 

Our principal market risk exposure is to oil, natural gas and NGL prices, which are inherently volatile. As such, future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in such prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing prices for oil and regional spot prices for natural gas and NGLs. We have used, and expect to continue to use, oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts to reduce our risk of price fluctuations of these commodities. Pursuant to our risk management policy, we engage in these activities as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with projected production levels. The fair value of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts at September 30, 2016 was a net asset of $97.1 million. 

Interest rate risk 

We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness. The terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 0.50% to 2.50% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. The base rate margins under the terminated term loan were 6.0% to 7.0% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding. The terms of our senior notes provide for a fixed interest rate through their respective maturity dates. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a weighted average rate of 2.29%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a weighted average rate of 2.38%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedure  s 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring every public company that files reports with the SEC to include a management report on such company s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report. Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ), our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for up to five years or through such earlier date that we are no longer an  emerging growth company  as defined in the JOBS Act. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 included a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceeding  s 

For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated in this item by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factor  s 

Our business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, could have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. 

For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report or our Quarterly Reports, except as set forth below. 

A significant portion of the value of the Merge Acquisition is associated with undeveloped acreage that is not held by production, will require substantial amounts of capital to develop and may not be economic. 

Most of the acreage we acquired in the Merge Acquisition is undeveloped and will require substantial amounts of capital to fully develop, which we may not be able to fully fund or may require significant issuances or incurrence of equity or debt which may not be available to us or may only be available at a cost that does not allow us to achieve our plans, development schedule and production schedule associated with the acreage. We may also significantly change our development plans in response to commodities pricing. As a result, our investment in these areas may not achieve the production growth or returns we anticipate or may render development opportunities uneconomic, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties. 

In addition, because most of the acreage we acquired in the Merge Acquisition is undeveloped, it is not held by production. Unless development or production, in accordance with the terms of the respective leases, is established, these leases will expire. If the acquired leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the properties. Our drilling and development plans for the area are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to establish the development or production necessary to hold our leases, we may be forced to pay extension fees to prevent those leases from expiring. If our leases expire or we are forced to pay extension fees in order to maintain them, the areas may not be as economic as we anticipate and we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. 

We may fail to realize the benefits anticipated as a result of the Merge Acquisition or the Anadarko Acquisition. 

There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition. The Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition involve potential risks, including: 

the failure to realize recoverable reserves;        

regulatory compliance and permitting;        

title issues or other unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities and costs;        

the incurrence of liabilities or other compliance costs related to environmental or regulatory matters, including potential liabilities that may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of conduct;        

the diversion of management's attention from our existing properties; and        

the incurrence of significant charges, such as asset devaluation or restructuring charges.     

49 

Table of Contents  

If these risks or other unanticipated liabilities were to materialize, any desired benefits of the Merge Acquisition or the Anadarko Acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future financial performance and results of operations could be negatively impacted. We cannot assure you that we will realize value from the Merge Acquisition or the Anadarko Acquisition that equals or exceeds the consideration paid. 

The Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition may not achieve their intended results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities. To date, we have conducted only limited diligence regarding the assets and liabilities we assumed in the Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition. These risks are heightened with respect to the Merge Acquisition because it involves the acquisition of a material amount of undeveloped acreage relative to our current undeveloped acreage position. 

We consummated the Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition because we believe they will result in various benefits and opportunities. Achieving the anticipated benefits of each of the Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Prior to closing each of the Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition, we only had the opportunity to conduct limited environmental and title due diligence. As a result, we may discover title defects or adverse environmental or other conditions of which we are currently unaware. Environmental, title and other problems could reduce the value of the properties to us, and, depending on the circumstances, we could have limited or no recourse to the Seller with respect to those problems. We assumed certain of the Seller's liabilities and are entitled to indemnification in connection with those liabilities in only limited circumstances and in limited amounts. We cannot assure that such potential remedies will be adequate for any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant. 

The risks involved in the Merge Acquisition are heightened due to the size and location of the acquisition. The Merge Acquisition involved our acquisition of approximately 18,000 undeveloped net acres in Canadian, Grady and McClain Counties, Oklahoma, which is a material amount of undeveloped acreage relative to our approximately 27,248 undeveloped net acres as of December 31, 2015. In addition, the properties acquired in the Merge Acquisition are located in the Merge, which is an area in which we do not have previous drilling experience. As a result, the risk that our ability to efficiently and effectively develop and produce the properties acquired in the Merge Acquisition is heightened. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively develop and produce the properties acquired in the Merge Acquisition, the areas may not be as economic as we anticipate and we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. 

The anticipated future growth of our business will impose significant added responsibilities on management. The anticipated growth may place strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our senior management's attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the Seller's business operations and the assets acquired in the Merge Acquisition and the Anadarko Acquisition. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to apply our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to the acquired business. We may also encounter risks, costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or other unanticipated liabilities, and use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we anticipate. We may not be able to successfully integrate the Seller's operations into our existing operations, successfully manage this additional acreage or realize the expected economic benefits of the Merge Acquisition or the Anadarko Acquisition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The development of the properties are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with oil and gas activities as described in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Our business requires substantial capital expenditures, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all. 

Our exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Our total capital expenditures for 2015 were $200.1 million excluding the impact of asset retirement costs. On November 3, 2016, the Company announced a further revised 2016 capital expenditures program, increasing full year 2016 guidance (excluding acquisitions) to $110.0 million primarily due to higher average working interest associated with Cleveland development program and expected Merge leasing. Historically, we have funded development and operating activities primarily through a combination of equity capital raised from a private equity partner and public equity offerings, through borrowings under our Revolver, through the issuance of debt securities and through internal operating cash flows. We intend to finance the majority of our capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016, including capital   

50 

Table of Contents  

expenditures related to the Merge Acquisition, with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Our capital expenditures have historically been greater than our cash flows from operations, and we expect our capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 to continue to exceed our cash flows. If necessary, we may also access capital through proceeds from potential asset dispositions and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including: 

the estimated quantities of our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;        

the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce from existing wells;        

the prices at which we sell our production;        

any gains or losses from our hedging activities;        

the costs of developing and producing our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;        

take-away capacity;        

our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;        

the ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and        

our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.     

If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may have limited ability to obtain the additional capital necessary to conduct our operations at expected levels. Our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our 2022 Notes (as defined above) and 2023 Notes (as defined above) may restrict our ability to obtain new debt financing. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGLs production or reserves, and in some areas a loss of properties. 

In addition, our estimate of the required development capital for the Merge Acquisition may not be sufficient for the actual development capital needs of the Merge Acquisition. If our estimate of the targeted development capital was lower than the actual needs of the Merge Acquisition, we could be required to fund such additional development capital needs out of other operating cash flows or borrowings under our Revolver and through the capital markets. 

External financing may be required in the future to fund our growth. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and financing under our senior secured credit facility and through the capital markets may not be available in the future. Without additional capital resources, we may be unable to pursue and consummate acquisition opportunities as they become available, and we may be forced to limit or defer our planned oil, natural gas and NGLs development program, which will adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our oil, natural gas and NGLs properties, in turn negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility is subject to redetermination and any reduction in the borrowing base may reduce our liquidity or result in our having to repay indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility earlier than anticipated. 

We have experienced significant recent declines in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility as a result of redeterminations and we expect further significant declines. The current borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility is $425 million. On October 28, 2016, we had availability of approximately $282 million on our senior secured credit facility. Further redeterminations occur at least semi-annually. Redeterminations are based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time. JEH and the administrative agent (acting at the direction of lenders holding at least 66   2   /   3   % of the outstanding loans) may each request one unscheduled borrowing base redetermination between each scheduled redetermination. In addition, the lenders may elect to redetermine the borrowing base upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our material operating agreements or upon the cancellation or termination of certain of our joint development agreements. The borrowing base may also be reduced as a result of   

51 

Table of Contents  

our issuance of unsecured notes, a continued or further reduction in the price or volume of our hedging positions or our consummation of significant asset sales. If current low commodity prices continue through such redetermination events, the borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility may be reduced. 

Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our liquidity, and, if a borrowing base reduction results in the outstanding amount of obligations under our senior secured credit facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within a short period of time. If alternate sources of capital are not available, any such reductions can also adversely affect our ability to fund our drilling program and development of our undeveloped properties, including those acquired in the Merge Acquisition, which in turn can limit our ability to replace or add reserves and maintain or grow our borrowing base, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Certain federal regulatory agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have recently focused on oil and gas lenders' examinations and ratings of reserve-based loans, with a view towards encouraging such lenders to reduce their exposure to potentially substandard loans to oil and gas companies. In March 2016, the OCC issued an updated "Oil and Gas Production Lending" bank examination booklet, which details potential regulatory requirements related to reserve-based lending. Whether or not these regulatory agencies are successful in implementing stricter requirements related to reserve-based lending, oil and gas lenders may respond to these discussions by taking a more conservative approach in their lending practices, which could also adversely impact future borrowing base redeterminations under our senior secured credit facility. 

Our issuance of Series A preferred stock may result in a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock being issued upon its conversion, or as dividends and redemption payments in respect of the Series A preferred stock, which issuances could reduce the value of our Class A common stock. 

In addition to the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of shares of our Series A preferred stock, the terms of our convertible preferred stock permit us, subject to certain limitations, to issue shares of our Class A common stock in lieu of cash to satisfy payments of dividends and redemption prices with respect to the Series A preferred stock. The number of shares issued for such payments will be determined based on 95% of a five day average market value of such shares determined shortly before such payments, and could be substantial, especially during periods of significant declines in market prices of our Class A common stock. 

The covenants applicable to our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our currently outstanding senior notes currently restrict, and any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may restrict, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. These limitations may cause us to be unable to pay dividends in cash on our Series A preferred stock unless we can obtain an amendment of such provisions or refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements. In most situations, however, we are permitted under our financing agreements to pay dividends in equity interests, including common stock, as permitted by the terms of the Series A preferred stock. Accordingly, dividends declared and paid in respect of the Series A preferred stock may be paid in Class A common stock and we will be restricted in the amount of dividends we are able to pay in cash, unless and until we obtain an amendment of our senior secured credit facility covenants. There is no assurance that we will obtain such an amendment. Issuance of shares of Class A common stock as dividends, upon the occurrence of conversion, including following a fundamental change, or upon redemption of the Series A preferred stock, will dilute ownership of the Class A common stock and accordingly may adversely affect its market value. 

The Series A preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock for other reasons. 

The market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be influenced by the Series A preferred stock. For example, the market price of our Class A common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by: 

investors' anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our Class A common stock received upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock;        

possible sales of our Class A common stock by investors who view the Series A preferred shares as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our Class A common stock; and

2. 
			               Purchase and Sale; Purchase Price  .    At the Closing, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (a) Seller agrees to sell and convey to Buyer the Properties, and (b) Buyer agrees to purchase, accept and pay for the Properties and to assume the Assumed Obligations.  In consideration for the sale of the Properties, Buyer will pay to Seller the purchase price of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY-THREE DOLLARS ($136,485,293.00), adjusted as set forth herein (the    Purchase Price   ), in immediately available funds at Closing (pursuant to wire transfer instructions designated in advance by Seller to Buyer in writing) for the account of Seller.  Within two (2) Business Days after the later of (i) the Execution Date or (ii) the execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement by all parties thereto, Buyer will deliver an earnest money deposit to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the    Escrow Agent   ) equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price (the    Deposit   ), and such amount, including any interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (the    Escrow Fund   ), is to be held in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of   Exhibit E   attached hereto (the    Escrow Agreement   ).  The Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the funds in accordance with   Section 11.3   and the Escrow Agreement.  The Purchase Price will be adjusted as set forth below in this   Section  2  .     

2.1. 

Title and Environmental Defects  .  The Purchase Price will be (a) decreased only for those uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental Defects that exceed, individually, the respective Individual Defect Thresholds and, collectively with all other uncured Title Defects and Environmental Defects that exceed the applicable Individual Defect Thresholds, the Aggregate Defect Threshold and (b) increased for Title Benefits, in each case, in accordance with this   Section  2.1  .  Buyer may deliver to Seller, on or before the Defect Notice Date, one or more Defect Notices (each meeting all of the requirements set forth in the definition thereof) specifying each defect associated with the Properties that Buyer asserts constitutes a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect.  Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title Defects or Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not been notified by Buyer pursuant to a valid Defect Notice by the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes.  The term    Defect Notice Date    means 5:00 p.m. Central Time on September 15, 2016.  All adjustments to the Purchase Price based on Title Defects and/or any breach of the special warranty contained in the Assignment (other than with respect to a Lien l (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) created by Seller that is liquidated in amount and constitutes a breach of Seller s special warranty title contained in the Assignment) will be based on the Allocated Values attributable to the affected Properties.  The defect amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another defect amount for Title Defects hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Purchase      

27242226    18    Asset Purchase Agreement  

Price.  In no event will the aggregate amount of Title Defect adjustments exceed the Allocated Value of a Property.  Subject to   Section   2.1.10   and   Section  2.1.11  , if the aggregate of all adjustments to the Purchase Price required under this Agreement in respect of a Property would equal or exceed the entire Allocated Value of such Property, then at Seller s option (which option must be exercised by delivering written notice to Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing) and in lieu of such adjustments, Seller may exclude such Property from the purchase and sale hereunder, and such Property shall be an Excluded Asset and the Purchase Price will be reduced in an amount equal to the entire Allocated Value of such Property, and any Title Defects or Environmental Defects asserted as to such Property will not be considered for purposes of determining whether the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met.  Upon timely delivery of a Defect Notice of a Title Defect or Environmental Defect under this   Section  2.1  , Buyer and Seller will in good faith negotiate the validity of the claim and the amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price using the following criteria:     

2.1.1 

(a) No single Title Defect or Title Benefit with respect to: (i) a Well shall be taken into account unless the value of such defect or benefit is determined to be more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), and (ii) a Lease shall be taken into account unless the value of such defect or benefit is determined to be more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00); and (b) no single Environmental Defect shall be taken into account unless the value of such defect is determined to be more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) (each such amount an    Individual Defect Threshold   ),     in which event the full amount of such defect or benefit shall be taken into account from the first Dollar.  For the avoidance of doubt, the value of any single Environmental Defect that affects multiple Properties shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the applicable Individual Defect Threshold has been met.     

2.1.2 

No adjustment will be made to the Purchase Price for either uncured Title Defects or for uncured Environmental Defects unless the total of all such uncured Title Defects that, subject to   Section  2.1.1  , exceed the Individual Defect Threshold for Title Defects and all such uncured Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Defect Threshold for Environmental Defects exceeds three and one-half percent (3 %) of the unadjusted Purchase Price in the aggregate (the    Aggregate Defect Threshold   ).  In the event that the aggregate of such uncured Title Defects and such uncured Environmental Defects exceed the Aggregate Defect Threshold after offsetting any Title Benefits pursuant to   Section  2.1.9  , the adjustment to the Purchase Price shall only be for the amount by which all such Title Defects and Environmental Defects (in excess of such Title Benefits) exceed the Aggregate Defect Threshold.  Subject to   Section  2.1.10   and   Section  2.1.11  , with respect to any Environmental Defects for which an adjustment greater than the Allocated Value of the affected Property is claimed in good faith in Buyer s Defect Notice, at either Party s option (which option must be exercised by delivering written notice to the other Party at least two (2)      

27242226    19    Asset Purchase Agreement  

Business Days prior to Closing), such Party may elect to exclude the affected Property from the transactions contemplated hereby, and such Property shall be an Excluded Asset and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the affected Property.     

2.1.3 

If the adjustment is based on Seller owning a Net Revenue Interest in a Lease or Well which is less than the Net Revenue Interest shown on   Exhibit A   for such Lease or Well, then the downward adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value for such Lease or Well on   Exhibit A   by a fraction, the numerator of which is an amount equal to the Net Revenue Interest shown on   Exhibit A   for such Lease or Well, less the Net Revenue Interest for such Lease or Well to which Seller is actually entitled taking the applicable Title Defect into account, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest shown on   Exhibit A   for such Lease or Well  .     

2.1.4 

If the adjustment is based on Seller owning a Working Interest in a Well which is larger than the Working Interest shown for such Well on   Exhibit A  , but without a proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interest for such Well, then the downward adjustment shall be calculated by determining the effective Net Revenue Interest that results from such larger Working Interest, determining what the Net Revenue Interest would be using such effective Net Revenue Interest and the Working Interest shown for such Property on   Exhibit A   and then calculating the adjustment in the manner set forth herein for adjustment based on reductions in the Net Revenue Interest.     

2.1.5 

If the adjustment is based on Seller owning fewer Net Acres in a Lease than those shown on   Exhibit A   for such Lease, then the downward adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value shown for such Lease on   Exhibit A   by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Net Acres shown on   Exhibit A   for such Lease, less the number of Net Acres in such Lease to which Seller is actually entitled taking the applicable Title Defect into account, and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres shown on   Exhibit A   for such Lease  .     

2.1.6 

If the adjustment is based on a Lien or other monetary charge upon a Lease or Well (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) that is liquidated in amount, then the downward adjustment is the lesser of the amount necessary to remove such Lien or other monetary charge from the affected Lease or the Allocated Value of the affected Lease or Well, provided, however, that in the event the monetary charge upon Seller s interest in such Lease or Well exceeds the Allocated Value, Buyer may elect to exclude the affected Lease or Well from the transactions contemplated hereby, and such Property shall be an Excluded Asset and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the affected Property.     

2.1.7 

If the adjustment is based on a liability to remediate or otherwise cure an Environmental Defect related to a Property, then the downward adjustment      

27242226    20    Asset Purchase Agreement  

is that portion for which Buyer would be liable after Closing of an amount equal to the lowest cost reasonably necessary for the remediation or correction or to otherwise cure such Environmental Defect (including all costs related to remediation, restoration, clean up, correction, removal, reporting, investigation and monitoring and any related criminal or civil fines, penalties and liabilities) in a manner that does not materially interfere with the use or operation of such Lease and that is consistent with applicable Environmental Law and prudent industry practices.     

2.1.8 

If the adjustment is based on an obligation, burden, or liability upon a Lease or Well for which Buyer s economic detriment is not liquidated but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, then, subject to the other provisions hereof, the downward adjustment is the amount equal to the lesser of the amount of such economic detriment or the Allocated Value of such Lease or Well.     

2.1.9 

If Seller determines that the ownership of any Lease entitles Seller to: (a) a larger Net Revenue Interest than that set forth on   Exhibit A   for such Well or Lease; or (b) a greater number of Net Acres than the number of Net Acres set forth on   Exhibit A   for such Lease (each, a    Title Benefit   ), then Seller shall notify Buyer of such Title Benefit in writing on or before the Defect Notice Date, which notice shall include a description of such Title Benefit, the Dollar value that Seller asserts is attributable to such Title Benefit and Seller s method of calculating such amount, together with all data and information in Seller s possession or control reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit. Seller shall be deemed to have conclusively waived any Title Benefit of which Seller fails to notify Buyer in the manner and by the date specified in the preceding sentence.  The upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of each Title Benefit shall be determined using the same principles as provided in this   Section  2.1   with respect to Title Defects and any such adjustment shall only be to the extent that the aggregate of all Title Benefits that exceed the Individual Defect Thresholds exceed the Aggregate Defect Threshold.     

2.1.10 

If a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured or remediated, as applicable, then Seller will provide notice to Buyer on or before five (5) days prior to the Closing Date stating whether or not Seller will attempt to cure such Title Defect or Environmental Defect.  If Seller provides notice electing to attempt to cure such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, then Seller will have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such defect for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing (the    Cure Period   )  , provided, that   such election shall not waive or be deemed to waive Seller s right to dispute the existence of such alleged defect or the Purchase Price adjustment asserted with respect thereto.  With respect to any alleged Title Defect Seller elects to cure or to which a Defect Dispute relates, (a) the Properties affected by such alleged Title Defect shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, (b) subject to the      

27242226    21    Asset Purchase Agreement  

applicable Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Threshold, the Purchase Price at Closing shall be reduced by the amount asserted by Buyer in the applicable Defect Notice attributable to such alleged Title Defect, and (c) Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent the amount set forth in   Section  2.1.10(b)  , such amount to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  After Closing, Buyer shall provide (or cause to be provided) to Seller and its representatives reasonable access to the Records during the Cure Period in connection with Seller s efforts to cure such alleged Title Defects.  With respect to any alleged Environmental Defect Seller elects to cure or to which a Defect Dispute relates, (x) the Properties affected by such alleged Environmental Defect shall be retained by Seller at Closing, (y) subject to the applicable Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Threshold, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the applicable Property, and (z) Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent the amount set forth in   Section  2.1.10(y)  , such amount to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

(b)    Presumption of Funding by Lenders  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.

If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.

(ii)  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts under Section 2.06(b)(i) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.

Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be permanent and may not be reinstated.

Date thereafter, the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $425,000,000.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowing Base may be subject to further adjustments from time to time pursuant to Section 8.12(c) or Section 9.11(d) or pursuant to Section 3(a) of Amendment No. 10. 

(b)    Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations  .  The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually in accordance with this Section 2.07 (a    Scheduled Redetermination   ), and, subject to Section 2.07(d), such redetermined Borrowing Base shall become effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2016.  In addition, the Borrower may, by notifying the Administrative Agent thereof, and the Administrative Agent may, at the direction of the Required Lenders, by notifying the Borrower thereof, each elect to cause the Borrowing Base to be redetermined once between each Scheduled Redetermination (together with any redetermination described in the immediately following sentence, an    Interim Redetermination   ) in accordance with this Section 2.07.  In addition to any Interim Redetermination described in the immediately preceding sentence, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Redetermination Event, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may, by notifying the Borrower thereof, elect to cause an additional redetermination of the Borrowing Base.  

(c)    Scheduled and Interim Redetermination Procedure  .  

(i)  Each Scheduled Redetermination and each Interim Redetermination shall be effectuated as follows:  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of (A) the Reserve Report and the certificate required to be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c), and, in the case of an Interim Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.11(b) and (c) and (B) such other reports, data and supplemental information, including, without limitation, the information provided pursuant to Section 8.11(c), as may, from time to time, be reasonably requested by the Required Lenders (the Reserve Report, such certificate and such other reports, data and supplemental information being the    Engineering Reports   ), the Administrative Agent shall evaluate the information contained in the Engineering Reports and shall, in good faith, propose a new Borrowing Base (the    Proposed Borrowing Base   ) based upon such information and such other information (including, without limitation, the status of title information with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties as described in the Engineering Reports and the existence of any other Debt) as the Administrative Agent deems appropriate in its sole discretion and consistent with its normal oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the particular time.  In no event shall the Proposed Borrowing Base exceed the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.  

(ii)  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Proposed Borrowing Base (the    Proposed Borrowing Base Notice   ):  

(A)  in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (1) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on or before the March 15th and September 15th of such year following the date of delivery or (2) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the   

36   

Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then promptly after the Administrative Agent has received complete Engineering Reports from the Borrower and has had a reasonable opportunity to determine the Proposed Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i); and 

(B)  in the case of an Interim Redetermination, promptly, and in any event, within fifteen (15) days after the Administrative Agent has received the required Engineering Reports.  

(iii)  Any Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or deemed to have been approved by all of the Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii); and any Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or be deemed to have been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii).  Upon receipt of the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice, each Lender shall have fifteen (15) days to agree with the Proposed Borrowing Base or disagree with the Proposed Borrowing Base by proposing an alternate Borrowing Base.  If, at the end of such 15-day period, any Lender has not communicated its approval or disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent, such silence shall be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Borrowing Base.  If, at the end of such 15-day period, all of the Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, or the Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect, have approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, the Proposed Borrowing Base, then the Proposed Borrowing Base shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d).  If, however, at the end of such 15-day period, all of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, have not approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, the Proposed Borrowing Base, then the Administrative Agent shall poll the Lenders to ascertain the highest Borrowing Base then acceptable to all of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, and, so long as such amount does not increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d).  

(d)    Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base  .  After a redetermined Borrowing Base is approved or is deemed to have been approved by all of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(iii), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the amount of the redetermined Borrowing Base (the    New Borrowing Base Notice   ), and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders:  

(i)  in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on or about April 1 or October 1, as applicable, following such notice, or (B) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower   

37   

pursuant to Section 8.11(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such notice; and 

(ii)  in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such notice.  

Such amount shall then become the Borrowing Base until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date, the next Interim Redetermination Date or the next adjustment to the Borrowing Base under Section 2.07(e), Section 8.12(c) or Section 9.11(d), whichever occurs first.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled Redetermination or Interim Redetermination shall become effective until the New Borrowing Base Notice related thereto is received by the Borrower. 

(e)    Mandatory Reductions in the Borrowing Base  .  In addition to the Borrowing Base redeterminations otherwise provided for in this Section 2.07, the Borrowing Base shall be automatically reduced as follows:  

(i)  Effective immediately upon each Senior Unsecured Debt Incurrence, the Borrowing Base then in effect shall be automatically reduced on the date of such incurrence by an amount equal to 25% of the principal amount of such Senior Unsecured Debt Incurrence;  

(ii)  With respect to any Oil and Gas Disposition, if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the aggregate Engineered Value of the Oil and Gas Properties covered by all Oil and Gas Dispositions made since the immediately preceding Scheduled Redetermination Date (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent), exceeds five percent (5%) of the Borrowing Base then in effect, then the Borrowing Base shall automatically be reduced on the date such Oil and Gas Disposition is effected by an amount equal to the value, if any, assigned to the Oil and Gas Properties subject to such Oil and Gas Disposition in the then-effective Borrowing Base, as reasonably determined by the Required Lenders; and  

(iii)  With respect to any Swap Event, if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of all Swap Event Reduction Amounts in respect of all Swap Events that have occurred since the immediately preceding Scheduled Redetermination Date (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent), exceeds five percent (5%) of the Borrowing Base then in effect, then the Borrowing Base shall automatically be reduced on the date such Swap Event is effected by an amount equal to the Swap Event Reduction Amount in respect thereof, as reasonably determined by the Required Lenders.  

Section 2.08    Letters of Credit  .  

(a)    General  .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of dollar denominated Letters of Credit for its own account in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period; provided that the Borrower may not request the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of Letters of Credit hereunder if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists at such time or would exist as a result thereof.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or   

38   

entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. 

(b)    Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions  .  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (not less than five (5) Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice:  

(i)  requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended;  

(ii)  specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day);  

(iii)  specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.08(c));  

(iv)  specifying the amount of such Letter of Credit;  

(v)  specifying the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit; and  

(vi)  specifying the amount of the then effective Borrowing Base and whether a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists at such time, the current total Revolving Credit Exposures (without regard to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit) and the   pro forma   total Revolving Credit Exposures (giving effect to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit).  

Each notice shall constitute a representation that after giving effect to the requested issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as applicable, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total Commitments (i.e. the lesser of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts and the then effective Borrowing Base   minus   the EOG Availability Blocker, if in effect at such time). 

If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  The letter of credit application shall be amended to the extent necessary to make it consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

(c)    Expiration Date  .  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is ten days prior to the Maturity Date; provided that any Letter of   

39   

Credit with a one-year term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above). 

(d)    Participations  .  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.08(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.08(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default, the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  

(e)    Reimbursement  .  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, Houston, Texas time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Houston, Texas time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that, if the Borrower fails to so reimburse such LC Disbursement by such time, the Borrower shall, subject to the conditions to Borrowing set forth herein, be deemed to have requested, and the Borrower does hereby request under such circumstances, that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply,   mutatis mutandis  , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(e), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by  

40   

a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 

(f)    Obligations Absolute  .  The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.08(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit Agreement, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.08(f), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower s obligations hereunder (other than payment in full).  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised all requisite care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  

(g)    Disbursement Procedures  .  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  

41   

(h)    Interim Interest  .  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, until the Borrower shall have reimbursed the Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a Borrowing under Section 2.08(e)), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans.  Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.08(h) shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.  

(i)    Replacement of the Issuing Bank  .  The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.05(b).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term  Issuing Bank  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  

(j)    Cash Collateralization  .  If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.08(j), (ii) the Borrower is required to pay to the Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), or (iii) the Borrower is otherwise required to provide cash collateral to secure the Fronting Exposure with respect to any Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower shall deposit, in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, an amount in cash equal to (x) in the case of an Event of Default, the LC Exposure, (y) in the case of a payment required by Section 3.04(c), the amount of such excess as provided in Section 3.04(c), and (z) in the case of a Defaulting Lender, the amount as required in Section 5.06(d), in any event, as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower or any Guarantor described in Section 10.01(h) or Section 10.01(i).  The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Secured Parties, an exclusive first priority and continuing perfected security interest in and Lien on such account and all cash, checks, drafts, certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held in such account, all deposits or wire transfers made thereto, any and all investments purchased with funds deposited in such account, all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets and other Property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise payable in respect of, or in exchange for, any   

42   

or all of the foregoing, and all proceeds, products, accessions, rents, profits, income and benefits therefrom, and any substitutions and replacements therefor.  The Borrower s obligation to deposit amounts pursuant to this Section 2.08(j) shall be absolute and unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount under the terms of a Letter of Credit, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be subject to any defense or be affected by a right of set-off, counterclaim or recoupment which the Borrower or any Guarantor may now or hereafter have against any such beneficiary, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any reason whatsoever.  Such deposit shall be held as collateral securing the payment and performance of the Borrower s or the Guarantors  obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and the Borrower is not otherwise required to pay to the Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), then such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. 

(k)    Certain Limitations  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in addition to such other conditions and terms that are expressly provided in this Agreement, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, increase, or extend any Letter of Credit hereunder (i) if such Letter of Credit is not a standby letter of credit or a letter of credit supporting the repayment of indebtedness for borrowed money of any Person, (ii) if such Letter of Credit is not governed by (A) the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (2007 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600, or (B) the International Standby Practices (ISP98), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 590, in either case, including any subsequent revisions thereof approved by a Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce and adhered to by the Issuing Bank, (iii) if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing, increasing or extending such Letter of Credit, or any Governmental Requirement applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance, increase or extension of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or (iv) if any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into reasonably satisfactory arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Bank s risk with respect to such Lender.  

43   

ARTICLE III Payments of Principal and Interest; Prepayments; Fees 

Section 3.01    Repayment of Loans  .  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Termination Date.  

Section 3.02    Interest  .  

(a)    ABR Loans  .  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.

(c)    Post-Default Rate  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if an Event of Default under Section 10.01(a), (b), (i) or (j) has occurred and is continuing, then all outstanding Senior Secured Debt (other than interest) shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of principal of any Loan, two percent (2%) plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (y) in the case of any other amount, two percent (2%) plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, and (ii) if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Required Lenders so elect, then all outstanding Senior Secured Debt (other than interest) shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of principal of any Loan, two percent (2%) plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (y) in the case of any other amount, two percent (2%) plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  

(d)    Interest Payment Dates  .

44   

elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and be binding upon the parties hereto.

(b)  the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

46

Fees, once paid, shall be fully earned and shall not be refundable under any circumstances.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices specified in Section 12.01, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.  

(b)    Application of Insufficient Payments  .  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.  

(c)    Sharing of Payments by Lenders  .  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective   

48   

Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall apply) but not including any Affiliate that is a financial institution, insurance company, commercial bank, investment bank, or any other entity that is an  accredited investor  (as defined in Regulation D enacted by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) that extends credit or buys loans as one of its businesses.  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 

Section 4.02    Presumption of Payment by the Borrower  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  

Section 4.03    Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent  .  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b), Section 2.08(d), Section 2.08(e) or Section 4.02 then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  After acceleration or maturity of the Loans, all principal will be paid ratably as provided in Section 10.02(c).  

Section 4.04    Disposition of Proceeds  .  The Security Instruments contain an assignment by the Borrower and/or the Guarantors unto and in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties of all of the Borrower s or Guarantors  interest in and to production and all proceeds attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property that constitutes Oil and Gas Properties.  The Security Instruments further provide in general for the application of such proceeds to the satisfaction of the Indebtedness and other obligations described therein and secured thereby.  Notwithstanding the assignment contained in such Security Instruments, until the occurrence of an Event of Default, (a) the Administrative   

49   

Agent and the Lenders agree that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such production nor take any other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to the applicable Credit Parties, and (b) the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause such proceeds to be paid to the applicable Credit Parties. 

ARTICLE V Increased Costs; Break Funding Payments; Taxes; Illegality; Defaulting Lender

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 

(b)    Capital Requirements  .  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered.  

(c)    Certificates  .

(d)    Effect of Failure or Delay in Requesting Compensation  .  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 5.01 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 365 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 365-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law; provided that if any withholding agent shall be required by applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of such withholding agent) to deduct or withhold any Tax from such payments, then (i) such withholding agent shall make such deduction or withholding and shall   

51   

timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as applicable, shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions or withholdings for Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.03(a)), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

A certificate of the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank as to the amount of such payment or liability under this Section 5.03 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  

(ii)  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without liming the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.04(c)(D) and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.03(e)(ii)(A) and (ii)(B) below and Section 5.03(f)) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(C)  any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.  

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(e) or Section 5.03(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 

(f)    FATCA  .

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

5.03, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment 

(b)    Replacement of Lenders  .  If (i) any Lender does not consent to any proposed increase in or reaffirmation of the Borrowing Base, (ii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (iii) in connection with any consent to or approval of any proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of each Lender or the consent of each Lender affected thereby, the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained but any Lender has not so consented to or approved such proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release, (iv) in connection with any consent to or approval of any proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of the Required Lenders, the consent of the Majority Lenders shall have been obtained but any Lender has not so consented to or approved such proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release, or (v) any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Tax or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, then, in any such case, (A) the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, and (B) the Administrative Agent may as to any Defaulting Lender upon notice to such Lender and the Borrower, require that such Lender assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to a permitted assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if such Lender accepts such assignment); provided that such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts).  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each Lender hereby agrees to make such assignment and delegations required under this Section 5.04.

56   

notice) and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made as (or converted into) ABR Loans, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Lender s Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans.

Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article XI or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.01(c) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:   first  , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;   second  , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank hereunder;   third  , to serve as cash collateral to be held by the Administrative Agent to secure the Issuing Lender s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.08(j);   fourth  , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan hereunder in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;   fifth  , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s current or potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) serve as cash collateral to secure the Issuing Bank s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.08(j);   sixth  , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the Issuing Bank against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   seventh  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   eighth  , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided   that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement of LC Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations of LC Disbursements owed to, all Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders on the applicable pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or   

57   

such Indebtedness as to Letters of Credit owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letter of Credit Obligations are held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to Section 5.06(a)(iv).  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 5.06(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 

(iii)    Certain Fees  .  

(I)  No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  

(II)  Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees under Section 3.05(b)(i) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided cash collateral pursuant to Section 5.06(d).  

(III)  With respect to any fee under Section 3.05 not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in the LC Exposure that has been reallocated to such non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the Issuing Bank the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  

(iv)    Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in the LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the Revolving Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Lender s Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation.  

(v)    Cash Collateral  .  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or   

58   

remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable law, cash collateralize the Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.08(j). 

(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure  .  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 5.06(a)(iv), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and   provided  , further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.  Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower s and the Administrative Agent s right to replace a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights and remedies available to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent against such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement, at law, in equity or by statute.  

(c)    Letters of Credit  .  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.  

(d)    Cash Collateral  .  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within two Business Days following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall deposit cash collateral with the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of the Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to   Section 5.06(a)(iv)   and any cash collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that cash collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank as herein provided, or that the total amount of such cash collateral is less than the amount of the Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to   Section 5.06(a)(iv)   and any cash collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) at such time, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional cash collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any cash collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  

(i)    Grant of Security Interest by Defaulting Lender; Agreement to Provide Cash Collateral  .  To the extent cash collateral is provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash collateral as security for such Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit, to be applied pursuant to clause (ii) below.  Such Defaulting Lender shall execute any   

59   

documents and agreements, including the Administrative Agent s standard form assignment of deposit accounts, that the Administrative Agent requests in connection therewith to establish such cash collateral account and to grant the Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in such account and the funds therein. 

(ii)    Application  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, cash collateral provided under this   Section 5.06(d)(i)   in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of the LC Exposure (including, as to cash collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the cash collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.  

(iii)    Termination of Requirement  .  Cash collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as cash collateral pursuant to this   Section 5.06(d)   following (A) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (B) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank that there exists excess cash collateral;   provided   that, subject to   Section 5.06(a)(ii)  , the Person providing cash collateral and the Issuing Bank may agree that cash collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations; and   provided   further that to the extent that such cash collateral was provided by the Borrower, such cash collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.

89   

Volumes Covered by Swap Agreements  

Applicable Period Covered By Swap Agreements  

85% of the anticipated projected production from proved Oil and Gas Properties  

First 24 months after the Measurement Date  

75% of the anticipated projected production from proved Oil and Gas Properties  

Months 25   60 after the Measurement Date  

For purposes of entering into or maintaining Swap Agreement trades or transactions under this   Section 9.16(a)(i)  , forecasts of reasonably anticipated production from the Borrower s and its Subsidiaries  proved Oil and Gas Properties as set forth on the most recent Reserve Report delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be revised to account for any increase or decrease therein anticipated because of information obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the publication of such Reserve Report including the Borrower s or any of its Subsidiaries  internal forecasts of production decline rates for existing wells and additions to or deletions from anticipated future production from new wells and completed acquisitions coming on stream or failing to come on stream. 

(ii)    Maintenance  .  If, after the end of any calendar month, commencing with the calendar month ending October 31, 2014, the Borrower determines that the Hedged Volume for such calendar month exceeded the Actual Production Volume for such month, then (A) the Borrower shall (1) promptly notify the Administrative Agent (but in any event within 21 days of such month end), and (2) if requested by the Administrative Agent, within 30 days after such request, effect (or cause the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor to effect) such Swap Terminations to the extent necessary to cause the Hedged Volume not to exceed 100% of reasonably anticipated projected production from Oil and Gas Properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the succeeding calendar months; and (B) as to any particular commodity (including substitutes therefor as provided in the penultimate sentence of this Section 9.16(a)) which is over-hedged for any calendar month, the Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to, enter into any Swap Agreement in respect of such commodity until the Borrower is in compliance with each of the requirements in the immediately preceding clause (A) or the Administrative Agent otherwise consents.  

The requirements in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.16(a) (x) shall be determined with volumes of oil, volumes of gas and volumes of natural gas liquids calculated separately and (y) shall not apply to basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged pursuant to other Swap Agreements or to put options and price floors (including floors embedded in participating swaps or other similar transactions to the extent not offset by calls) for Hydrocarbons with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor is the buyer of such put options or price floors.  Furthermore, so long as the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors properly identify and consistently report such Swap Agreements in the production reports required under Section 8.01(m), the B  o  rrower may utilize Swap Agreements covering crude oil as a substitute for hedging natural gas liquids on an Economic BOE (as defined below) basis; provided that, (A) in 

90   

determining compliance with Section 9.16(a)(i) above, the Borrower shall use the Economic BOE in effect at the time the Swap Agreement is entered into and (B) in determining compliance with Section 9.16(a)(ii) above, the Borrower shall use the Economic BOE in effect at the time of calculation (and not at the time the applicable Swap Agreement was entered into).     Economic BOE    means the volume of crude oil (measured in barrels) of the Borrower s and Subsidiary Guarantors  production that has the equivalent value (in dollars) to one barrel of natural gas liquids of the Borrower s and Subsidiary Guarantors  production as determined on a trailing twelve month basis.

(c)    Limitations  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any Swap Agreement contain any requirement, agreement or covenant for the Borrower or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to post collateral (including a letter of credit) or margin to secure their obligations under such Swap Agreement or to cover market exposures; provided that, this clause (c) shall not prevent a Hedge Bank from requiring the obligations under its Swap Agreement with any Credit Party to be secured by the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent under the Security Instruments pursuant to such Security Instruments.  

(d)    Acquisition Swap Agreements  .  

(i)  Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.16(a) to the contrary but subject to clause (iii) below, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor may enter into commodity Swap Agreements with an Approved Counterparty having notional volumes in excess of the amounts set forth in Section 9.16(a)(i) (such Swap Agreements being    Acquisition Swap Agreements   ) in anticipation of the acquisition of Oil and Gas Properties in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement (any such Oil and Gas Properties being referred to herein as the    Target Oil and Gas Properties    and any such acquisition being referred to herein as a    Subject Acquisition   ) if (x) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, has entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement for such Target Oil and Gas Properties, (y) the tenor of any such Acquisition Swap Agreement does not exceed a period of beginning on the expected closing date of such Subject Acquisition equal to the remainder of the calendar year in which such Acquisition Swap Agreements are entered into plus the next 5 calendar years and (z) the aggregate notional volume of commodities covered under all of the Acquisition Swap Agreements with respect to any Subject Acquisition in any month, determined on the Measurement Date with respect thereto, shall not exceed for each month during the period during which such Acquisition Swap Agreement is in effect, the greater of (A) 100% of the Projected Target Property PDP Volumes and (B) the volumes set forth in the grid below for the applicable period as determined by the Borrower s internal engineers as proved reserves:  

91   

Volumes Covered by Acquisition Swap Agreements  

Applicable Period Covered by Acquisition Swap Agreements  

85% of the anticipated projected production from proved Target Oil and Gas Properties  

First 24 months after acquisition of Target Oil and Gas Properties  

75% of the anticipated projected production from proved Target Oil and Gas Properties  

Months 25   60 after acquisition of Target Oil and Gas Properties  

The requirements in this clause (i) shall (x) be determined with volumes of oil, volumes of gas and volumes of natural gas liquids calculated separately and (y) not apply to basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged pursuant to other Acquisition Swap Agreements or to put options and price floors (including floors embedded in participating swaps or other similar transactions to the extent not offset by calls) for Hydrocarbons with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor is the buyer of such put options or price floors. 

(ii)  Subject to the terms of clause (iii) below, with respect to Target Oil and Gas Properties, (x) the aggregate notional volume of commodities covered under all Acquisition Swap Agreements with respect to such Target Oil and Gas Properties shall not be included in any determination of  Hedged Volume  for purposes of determining compliance with Section 9.16(a) above, and (y) actual volumes of production from such Target Oil and Gas Properties shall not be included in any calculation of  Actual Production Volumes  for purposes of determining compliance with Section 9.16(a) above.  

(iii)  With respect to each Subject Acquisition, from and after the earlier to occur of (A) the consummation of such Subject Acquisition and (B) the 90  th   day after the date on which the definitive purchase and sale agreement for such Subject Acquisition was entered into by the Borrower or any Guarantor, the Borrower shall be required to comply with Section 9.16(a) without giving effect to any of the provisions of clause (ii) above;   provided   that (x) if such Subject Acquisition is not consummated on or before the 90  th   day after the date on which the definitive purchase and sale agreement for such Subject Acquisition was entered into, any Reserve Report containing information with respect to the Target Oil and Gas Properties shall be deemed not to include such information and (y) if such Subject Acquisition is consummated on or before the 90  th   day after the date on which the definitive purchase and sale agreement for such Subject Acquisition was entered into, the actual volumes of production from the Target Oil and Gas Properties shall be fully taken into account for purposes of calculating Actual Production Volumes as if such Subject Acquisition had been consummated on the first day of the three-month period covered by the Quarter-End Production Report most recently delivered prior to the consummation of such Subject Acquisition pursuant to Section 8.01(m).

Section 11.02    Duties and Obligations of Administrative Agent  .  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (the use of the term  agent  herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law; rather, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties), (b) the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except as provided in Section 11.03, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any Guarantor that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in ARTICLE VI or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or as to those conditions precedent expressly required to be to the Administrative Agent s satisfaction, (vi) the existence, value, perfection or priority of any collateral security or the financial or other condition of the Borrower and the Guarantors, or (vii) any failure by the Borrower or any other Person (other than itself) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or the performance or observance of any covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein.  For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in ARTICLE VI, each Lender shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from such Lender prior to the proposed closing date specifying its objection thereto.  

99   

Section 11.03    Action by Administrative Agent  .  The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) and in all cases the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless it shall (a) receive written instructions from the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) specifying the action to be taken and (b) be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders.  If a Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite Lenders in the written instructions (with indemnities) described in this Section 11.03, provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.  In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or the Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02), and otherwise the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith INCLUDING ITS OWN ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  

Section 11.04    Reliance by Administrative Agent  .  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon and the Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby waive the right to dispute the Administrative Agent s record of such statement, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof permitted hereunder shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.  

Section 11.05    Subagents  .  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the  

100   

Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding Sections of this ARTICLE XI shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 

Section 11.06    Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent  .  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.06, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or removal as the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this ARTICLE XI and Section 12.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 

Section 11.07    Administrative Agent as Lender  .  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of the Guarantors or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. 

Section 11.08    No Reliance  . 

(a)  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Guarantor of this  

101   

Agreement, the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Borrower or any Guarantor.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower (or any of its Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates.  In this regard, each Lender acknowledges that Bracewell   Giuliani LLP is acting in this transaction as special counsel to the Administrative Agent only, except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in any legal opinion or any Loan Document.  Each other party hereto will consult with its own legal counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in connection with the Loan Documents and the matters contemplated therein. 

(b)  The Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Arranger are acting solely in administrative capacities with respect to structuring and syndication of this facility and have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents other than their administrative duties, responsibilities and liabilities specifically as set forth in the Loan Documents and in their capacity as Lenders hereunder.  In structuring, arranging or syndicating this Agreement, each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative Agent and the Arranger may be an agent or lender under these Notes, other loans or other securities and waives any existing or future conflicts of interest associated with their role in such other debt instruments.  If in the administration of this facility or any other debt instrument, the Administrative Agent determines (or is given written notice by any Lender that a conflict exists), then it shall eliminate such conflict within ninety (90) days or resign pursuant to Section 11.06 and shall have no liability for action taken or not taken while such conflict existed. 

Section 11.09    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim  . 

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, Jones Parent, or any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 

(a)  to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Indebtedness that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Section 12.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 

(b)  to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 

102   

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 12.03. 

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Indebtedness or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Each Lender, the Issuing Bank and each other Secured Party (by their acceptance of the benefits of any Lien encumbering the Mortgaged Property) hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower, at the Borrower s sole cost and expense, any and all releases of Liens, termination statements, assignments or other documents reasonably requested by the Borrower in connection with any sale or other disposition of Property to the extent such sale or other disposition is permitted by the terms of Section 9.11 or is otherwise authorized by the terms of the Loan Documents.  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Secured Parties will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 11.10. 

(b)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary, the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent, and each Secured Party hereby agree that no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranties, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the Security Instruments may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents.  By accepting the benefit of the Liens granted pursuant to the Security Instruments, each Secured Party not party hereto hereby agrees to the terms of this paragraph (c).

(a)  No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 12.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

(A)  the Borrower, provided that (i) no consent of the Borrower shall be required if such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (ii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 days after having received notice thereof; and 

109   

(B)  the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

(A)  except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(B)  each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement; 

(C)  the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.04(c). 

(iv)  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and reimbursement obligations with respect to LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender 

110   

pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  In connection with any changes to the Register, if necessary, the Administrative Agent will reflect the revisions on Annex I and forward a copy of such revised Annex I to the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and each Lender. 

(v)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 12.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 12.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 12.04(b). 

(c)  Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (D) such Lender shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register that contains the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans, Commitments and other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register   ), but such Lender shall not have any obligation to disclose all or a portion of such register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation under the Loan Documents) to any Person other than if necessary to establish that a Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation under the Loan Documents is in registered form for Tax purposes.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 12.02 that affects such Participant.  In addition such agreement must provide that the Participant be bound by the provisions of Section 12.03.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 (subject to the requirements and  

111   

limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 5.03(e) and Section 5.03(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 5.03(e) and Section 5.03(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.04(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 5.04 as if it were an assignee under Section 12.04(b); and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.01 or Section 5.03, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.04(b) with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 4.01(c) as though it were a Lender. 

(d)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this (d) shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 

(e)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender or any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower or any Guarantor to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the  Blue Sky  laws of any state.

The provisions of Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.

(b)  To the extent that any payments on the Indebtedness or proceeds of any collateral are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Indebtedness so satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and the Administrative Agent s and the Lenders  Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue in full force and effect.  In such event, each Loan Document shall be automatically reinstated and the Borrower shall take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to effect such reinstatement. 

Section 12.06    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness  .

115   

Section 12.12    Interest Rate Limitation  .  It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it.  Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as to any Lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable to such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents or any agreement entered into in connection with or as security for the Notes, it is agreed as follows:  (i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender under any of the Loan Documents or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Notes shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations not then due and payable and as to which no claim has been made as of the time of determination), refunded by such Lender to the Borrower); and (ii) in the event that the maturity of the Notes is accelerated by reason of an election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically by such Lender as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations not then due and payable and as to which no claim has been made as of the time of determination), refunded by such Lender to the Borrower).  All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the stated term of the Loans evidenced by the Notes until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law.  If at any time and from time to time (i) the amount of interest payable to any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.12 and (ii) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been payable to such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section 12.12.  To the extent that Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code is relevant for the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to a Lender, such Lender elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Chapter by the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect.  Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code does not apply to the Borrower s obligations hereunder.
