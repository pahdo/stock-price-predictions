Explanatory
Note    

Cabinet Grow, Inc. (the  Company )
is filing this amendment on Form 10-Q/A (this  Amendment ) to amend its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, as filed on December 14, 2015 (the  Original Filing ), to restate (1) its
condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and
(2) Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of or Plan of Operation for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2014, as a result of the Company not previously measuring and re-measuring
the fair value of warrants issued to purchase common stock and convertible notes issued and to correct the per share value from
$0.20 to $0.40 to reflect the fair value based on the most recent sale price of the Company s common stock at the time the
shares were granted.  

See Note 11  Restated Financial Statements 
to the Company s restated condensed and consolidated financial statements. 
 
In connection with the Original Filing, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our
management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act,
and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2015. Subsequently, the Company s
management has determined that the improper design of controls with respect to the calculation of the fair value of the warrants
was a deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting resulting from the material weakness identified at September
30, 2015.  
 
Except as required to reflect the effects of the corrections for the items above, no additional modifications or updates have
been made to the Original Filing and are set forth in this Amendment. Information not affected by these corrections remains unchanged
and reflects the disclosure made at the time of the Original Filing. This Amendment does not describe other events occurring after
the Original Filing, including exhibits, or modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events. This Amendment should
be read in conjunction with the Company s filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission subsequent to the filing
of the Original Filing, as information in such reports and documents may update or supersede certain information contained in
this Amendment.  

The certifications of the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, are attached to this Amendment as Exhibits 31.1 and 32.1, respectively.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

 (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION  

BUSINESS 

Cabinet Grow, Inc. (the  Company 
or  CG-NV ) began operations in California in 2008, doing business as Universal Hydro ( Hydro ). Prior
to April 2014, the Company was a sole proprietorship owned by its  current chief operating officer and stockholder. On April
28, 2014, the Company registered with the Secretary of State of California as Cabinet Grow, Inc. ( CG-CA ), and all
of the business, assets and liabilities of Hydro were assigned to CG-CA. On May 14, 2014, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation
with the Nevada Secretary of State. On May 15, 2014, CG-CA merged with CG-NV, with CG-NV being the surviving entity. 

The Company s common stock is quoted
on the OTC Market Group, Inc. s OTCQB Marketplace under the symbol  CBNT.  

The Company
is a manufacturer and distributor of cabinet-based horticultural systems. The Company s design and production of hydroponic
and soil grow cabinets makes the process of growing in a self-contained cabinet automated and simplified. The Company s mission
is  to make hydroponic and soil growing simpler, more efficient and a better value than other
products found on the market. Substantially all of the Company s sales are to individuals in the United States via the Company s
website.  

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below,
these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included
in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report for
the year ended December 31, 2014 on Form 10-K. Interim results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year. Certain amounts from the 2014 period have been reclassified
to conform to the presentation used in the current period. 

EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 

We qualify as an  emerging
growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). Section 107 of the JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

INVENTORY 

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or
market value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving
inventory is made based on management analysis or inventory levels and future sales forecasts. Inventory of $49,336 and $48,761
as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, was comprised of raw materials. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 

Property and equipment are stated
at cost, and depreciation is provided by use of straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated
useful lives of property and equipment are as follows: 

Manufacturing equipment 
     10 years  
 
     Office equipment and furniture 
     7 years  
 
     Computer hardware and software 
     3 years  

The Company's property and equipment consisted of the following
at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014: 

Depreciation expense of $21,718 and $4,072
was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605,  Revenue
Recognition.  ASC 605 requires that the following four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the period in which the product is shipped. 

SHIPPING AND HANDLING 

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers
are recorded in sales. Shipping costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of sales. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 and 2014, the shipping costs were as follows: 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Expenditures for research and development
are charged to expense as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the costs were as follows: 

ADVERTISING 

The Company records advertising costs as incurred.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, advertising expense was as follows: 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable and convertible debt. The carrying
amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate
market interest rates of these instruments. The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

INCOME TAXES 

Prior to May 2014,
the Company was organized as a sole proprietorship and was not subject to income taxes. Rather, the Company s sole stockholder
was subject to income taxes on the Company s taxable activity. In May 2014, the Company became subject to income taxes and
will be subject to Federal and State income taxes as a corporation. 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740-10,  Income Taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future
tax effects, calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. A valuation allowance related to a
deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. 

ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. Interest
and penalties are classified as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor paid,
any interest or penalties. 

Uncertain tax positions
are measured and recorded by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the
effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. 

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 

The Company reports earnings (loss) per share
in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities
outstanding during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, 14,287,500 shares of common stock underlying
convertible debt and warrants have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB and the SEC did not have, or are not believed by management to have, a material impact on the Company's present or
future consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 3   SALES CONCENTRATION AND CONCENTRATION
OF CREDIT RISK  

CASH 

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains cash balances at one financial
institution, which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts. 

PURCHASES 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2015 and 2014, the Company made significant purchases from three suppliers as follows: 

NOTE 4   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  

In May and June 2014 (the  May and June
2014 Notes ), the Company issued 3 convertible promissory notes, each in the amount of $22,000. The Company received proceeds
of $60,000 in the aggregate. Each of the May and June 2014 Notes matured on the six month anniversary of its issuance date, carried
interest at 10% and contained a 9.1% original issue discount ( OID ). The OID was amortized over the earlier of the
conversion of the note or the maturity date. The holders of the note can convert the notes into shares of common stock at any time
from the date of issuance to maturity at $0.20 per share. In December 2014, the Company received conversion notices from the holders
of the May and June 2014 Notes and accordingly, recorded the conversion of $66,000 of principal and $4,177 of accrued and unpaid
interest of the three convertible promissory notes and 352,242 shares of common stock to be issued at a conversion price of $0.20
per share. The shares were issued in January 2015. 

On June 3, 2014, the Board authorized the Company
to enter into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. ( CVP ). Pursuant
to the SPA, the Company agreed to issue to CVP a Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $1,657,500 (the
 Note ). 

On June 6, 2014, the Company executed the SPA
with CVP, for the sale of the Company Note in the principal amount of up to $1,657,500 (which includes CVP s legal expenses
in the amount of $7,500 and a $150,000 OID) for $1,500,000, consisting of $500,000 paid in cash on June 11, 2014 (the  Closing
Date ), two $250,000 secured promissory notes and two $250,000 promissory notes (the  Investor Notes ), aggregating
$1,000,000, bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The Investor Notes are due 30 months from the Closing Date and may be
prepaid, without penalty. Advances received, OID charged and deferred financing costs incurred to CVP are as follows: 

The Company has also not recorded the $607,000
remaining unfunded balance of the Investor Notes issued by CVP to the Company. 

The Note bears interest at the rate of 10%
per annum. All interest and principal must be repaid on the date that is 30 months after the Closing Date. The Note may be converted
at the option of the holder, on the date that is six months from the Trading Date (defined in the Purchase Agreement as the date
on which the Common Stock is first trading on an Eligible Market, but in any event the Company shall cause its Common Stock to
be trading on an Eligible Market within nine months of the Closing Date of June 11, 2014) or at any time thereafter at a conversion
price of $0.1976. The conversion price is equal to $6,500,000 divided by 33,000,000 (the amount of fully diluted shares of Common
Stock of the Company on the date the Company filed its  Registration Statement). If the holder funds $1,500,000 and elects
to convert the Note into Common Stock, the number of shares issuable upon conversion will be 8,287,500. In the event the Company
elects to prepay all or any portion of the Company Note, the Company is required to pay to CVP an amount in cash equal to 125%
multiplied by the sum of all principal, interest and any other amounts owing. On July 16, 2015, CVP converted $50,000 of accrued
and unpaid interest under the Company Note into 253,846 shares of common stock. The Company also reduced derivative liabilities
for the fair value of the conversion of $70,658 and reclassified the amount to additional paid in capital.  

Initially the Company determined that
the conversion feature of the convertible note did not meet the criteria of an embedded derivative and therefore the conversion
feature was not bi-furcated and accounted for as a derivative because the Company was a private company, there was no quoted price
and no active market for the Company s common stock. 

Since the convertible note included an embedded
conversion feature that did not qualify to be bi-furcated as a derivative, management evaluated this feature to determine whether
it meets the definition of a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ) within the scope of ASC 470-20,  Debt with
Conversion and Other Options , and determined that a BCF existed. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and
prior to the Company becoming a public company received $163,000 in new fundings and recorded a note discount of $179,300 (including
$16,300 of OID), to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan. The Company became trading as a public company
on July 13, 2015, and on that date the Company determined the conversion feature of the Note represented an embedded derivative
since the Note was convertible into a variable number of shares upon conversion. Accordingly, on July 13, 2015, the Note was not
considered to be conventional debt under ASC 815 and the embedded conversion feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted
for as a derivative liability. Accordingly, the fair value of the derivative instruments for the fundings of the Note that occurred
prior to July 13, 2015, were recorded as a liability on July 13, 2015, on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding
amount recorded as a discount to the Note. Such discount is being amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity date of
the Note. The change in the fair value of the liability for derivative contracts are recorded in other income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations at the end of each quarter, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet.
The embedded feature included in the Note resulted in an initial debt discount of $233,500, an initial derivative liability expense
of $1,241,340 and initial derivative liability of $1,474,800.  

Additionally, from July 13, 2015, through
September 30, 2015, the Company received $70,000 in new fundings and increased the Company Note by $84,500 including $7,000 of
OID and $7,500 of legal costs. The Company recorded an initial discount against the new fundings in the amount of $84,500 to be
amortized into interest expense over the term of the Note.  

The Company also issued a five year warrant
to CVP to purchase the number of shares equal to $420,000 divided by 70% of the average of the three lowest closing bid prices
in the 20 trading days immediately after becoming public (the  Market Price ). Since the Company was not public
and could not determine the Market Price, based on the current discounted cash flow valuation, the Company initially
estimated that CVP can purchase 6,000,000 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $0.20 per share. As of September
30, 2015, based on the Market Price, the Company estimated the number of shares that CVP can purchase to be 1,636,362.  

Accounting Standard
Codification  ASC  815    Derivatives and Hedging , which provides guidance on determining what types
of instruments or embedded features in an instrument issued by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for
the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in the pronouncement on accounting for derivatives. These
requirements can affect the accounting for warrants issued by the Company. As the detachable warrants issued with the Note do
not have fixed settlement provisions because their exercise prices may be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower prices
in the future, we have concluded that the warrants are not indexed to the Company s stock and are to be treated as derivative
liabilities.  

  The warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. In order to calculate the fair value of the warrants, certain assumptions were made regarding components
of the model, including the closing price of the underlying common stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend
yield, and expected life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to valuation. Since the Company was not
public, an estimated a volatility factor utilizing an average of comparable published volatilities of peer companies was utilized.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for treasury securities of
similar maturity. The warrants associated with the Note were initially valued and recorded a derivative liability of $577,100
using the Black-Scholes valuation methodology and the Company also recorded an initial derivative liability expense of $77,100
and a discount to the Note of $500,000.  

  On December 31, 2014,
the Company revalued the warrant at $581,373 using the Black- Scholes option pricing model and recorded an additional derivative
liability expense of $4,273 for the year ended December 31, 2014. On September 30, 2015, the Company revalued the warrant at $605,238
using the Black- Scholes option pricing model and recorded derivative liability expense of $23,865 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 and increased the derivative liability on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2015.  

A summary of the derivative liability balance as of September
30, 2015 is as follows:  

Derivative liabilities were valued using
the Black-Scholes option using the following assumptions:  

The Company amortized $182,368 and $463,637
of the Note discount to interest expense for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2015, respectively, and the carrying
amount of the Company Note as of September 30, 2015, was $587,615, net of unamortized discounts of $409,685, and as of December
31, 2014, was $357,478, net of the unamortized discount of $376,022.  

A summary of the convertible note payable balance as of September

As security for the Note, the Company s
CEO and COO each pledged to CVP their 50 shares of Class A Preferred Stock (see Note 8). The pledge immediately expires upon the
shares of common stock of the Company being publicly traded and listed or designated for quotation on any of The New York Stock
Exchange, NYSE Amex, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Capital Market, the OTC Bulletin Board,

Pursuant to the terms of the Note, the Company
was required to deliver the Installment Amount (as defined in the Note) on or before each Installment Date (as defined in the Note)
until the Note was repaid. The Company failed to deliver the Installment Amount in June 2015, July 2015 and August 2015 (each,
a  Breach  and collectively, the  Breaches ). Each such Breach would constitute a separate event of default
pursuant to the terms of the Note if so declared by the Lender. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance and
Standstill Agreement, CVP agreed to refrain and forbear from exercising and enforcing its remedies with respect to the Breaches
until the earliest occurrence of (a) any breach of the Forbearance and Standstill Agreement, or (b) any event of default after
the effective date of the Forbearance and Standstill Agreement other than the Breaches. Assuming that no additional events of default
occur under the Note and no breaches of the Forbearance and Standstill Agreement occur, CVP agreed, for a period of 90 days from
September 10, 2015 (the  Standstill Period ), that it will not seek to convert any portion of the outstanding balance
of the Note without the Company s prior written consent, nor will the Company be required to deliver any Installment Amount
to CVP during the Standstill Period. 

In addition, CVP agreed that for a period of
180 days following September 10, 2015 (the  Modified Conversion Period ), CVP s conversion price shall be equal
to $0.40 per share, and that during the Modified Conversion Period, CVP will not made any conversions without the Company s
prior written consent. Also, any conversion amount applicable to any CVP conversion made during the Modified Conversion Period
will automatically be applied toward and reduce the next Installment Amount due and payable to CVP. Upon conclusion of the Modified
Conversion Period, CVP s conversion rights set forth in the Note shall revert to the terms and conditions set forth in Note. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance and
Standstill Agreement, the next Installment Date will be the date that is 90 days from the date of the Forbearance and Standstill
Agreement and each subsequent Installment Date will be on the same day of each month thereafter until the Note s maturity
date. In addition, the Installment Amount due on the next three Installment Dates shall be equal to $50,000. 

The Company agreed that so long as the Note
remains outstanding and the warrant issued to CVP in connection with the Note is not fully exercised or expired pursuant to its
terms, the Company will not (i) issue any new shares of Class A preferred stock, (ii) issue any debt, (iii) issue other securities
that have redemption rights, rights of first refusal, preemptive rights or similar rights not associated with the Company s
common stock, or (iv) consummate any transaction pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) or 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
equity line of credit or financing arrangement or other transaction that involves issuing securities convertible into Company common
stock with a conversion price that varies with the market price of the common stock, without CVP s prior written consent. 

CVP granted to the Company the right to repurchase
the Note, the Warrant and the other transaction documents for $978,500 within 90 days of September 10, 2015. CVP also agreed to
pay to the Company $5,000, which payment will constitute a partial payment of the Investor Notes. The Company agreed to pay CVP
$7,500, which shall be added to and included as part of the outstanding balance of the Note. 

The Company issued three convertible promissory
notes in August 2015 (the  August 2015 Notes ) in the amounts of $86,250, $11,500 and $46,000, respectively.
The Company received proceeds of $75,000, $10,000 and $40,000. The August 2015 Notes mature on the six month anniversary of its
issuance date, carries interest at 10% and contained a 10% original issue discount ( OID ). The Company recorded
the OID of $18,750 as a discount to the Note, to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the Note. Each of the holders
of the August 2015 Notes can convert the note into shares of common stock at any time from the date of issuance to maturity at
$0.20 per share. Accordingly, the Company received a conversion notice from each holder of the August 2015 Notes and issued in
the aggregate 718,750 shares of restricted common stock. The company valued and recorded an initial derivative liability of
$168,930 using the Black Scholes valuation methodology of which $125,000 was recorded as a discount to the August Notes and the
remaining $43,930 was recorded as expense. Upon conversion of the August Notes the Company reclassified $168,930 of the derivative
liability to additional paid in capital.

on October 27, 2015. The company valued and recorded an initial derivative liability of $6,877 using the Black Scholes valuation
methodology of which $5,750 was recorded as a discount to the September Note and the remaining $1,127 was recoded as expense.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN 

On May 11, 2015, the Company s Board
of Directors adopted the 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the  Plan ). Persons eligible to participate in the Plan include
Employees (as defined in the Plan), officers and directors of the Company. 

Term   

The Plan became effective upon its adoption
by the Board. Options and stock awards may be granted immediately thereafter; provided, that no option may be exercised and no
stock award may be granted under the Plan until it is approved by the stockholders of the Company, within 12 months after the date
of adoption by the Board. The Plan shall continue in effect for a term of 10 years from the date of the Plan s adoption by
the Board unless terminated earlier as provided in the Plan. 

Administration   

The Plan will be administered by the Board
or a committee designated by the Board (the  Committee ). The Committee may grant options and stock awards under the
Plan. 

Maximum Shares Available   

The maximum aggregate number of shares that
may be issued under the Plan through awards is 5,000,000 shares. 

Adjustments   

The maximum aggregate number of shares that
may be issued under the Plan, the number and kind of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the price per share (but not
the total price) subject to each outstanding award shall be proportionally adjusted to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights
under the Plan for any change in the outstanding common stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any award, resulting from any
stock splits, combination or exchange of shares, consolidation, spin-off or recapitalization of shares or any capital adjustment
or transaction similar to the foregoing or any distribution to holders of common stock other than regular cash dividends. 

Awards   

Options  

The Committee may grant options to purchase
shares of common stock under the Plan from time to time in the discretion of the Administrator or automatically upon the occurrence
of specified events, including the achievement of performance goals, and for the satisfaction of an event or condition within the
control of the grantee or within the control of others. 

The per share exercise price of an option shall
be determined by the Committee, provided, however that (i) the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a non-10%
stockholder shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date, (ii) the
exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value of
the Company s common stock on the grant date, and (iii) the exercise price of a nonstatutory stock option shall be no less
than 100% of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date. 

Only employees may be granted incentive stock
options. Notwithstanding the designation  incentive stock option  in an option agreement, if the aggregate fair market
value of the shares with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by the grantee during any
calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, then the portion of such options that exceeds $100,000 shall be
treated as nonstatutory stock options. 

Restricted Stock  

The Committee may grant stock awards pursuant
to a stock award agreement that shall contain provisions regarding (i) the number of shares subject to such stock award or a formula
for determining such number; (ii) the purchase price, if any, of the shares, and the means of payment for the shares; (iii) the
performance criteria, if any, and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the number of shares granted,
issued, retained, or vested, as applicable; (iv) such terms and conditions on the grant, issuance, vesting, or forfeiture of the
shares, as applicable, as may be determined from time to time by the Committee; (v) restrictions on the transferability of the
stock award; and (vi) such further terms and conditions in each case not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined from time
to time by the Committee. 

Unless otherwise provided by the Committee,
the grantee shall have the rights equivalent to those of a stockholder and shall be a stockholder only after shares are issued
(as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) to the
grantee. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a grantee holding stock units shall be entitled to receive dividend payments
as if he or she were an actual stockholder. 

On July 24, 2015, the board of directors of
the Company approved the granting of 1,323,500 shares of restricted common stock, including 750,000 shares awarded to the Company s

equal in value to an aggregate of $7,000 (amended to $6,000) per month to two employees as part of their compensation. 

WARRANTS 

The Company issued a five year warrant (which
expires on June 30, 2019) to CVP to purchase the number of shares equal to $420,000 divided by 70% of the average of the three
lowest closing bid prices in the 20 trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion (the  Market Price ).
Since the Company was not public and could not determine the Market Price, based on the current discounted cash flow valuation,
the Company initially estimated that CVP can purchase 6,000,000 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $0.20 per share.
As of September 30, 2015, based on the Market Price, the Company estimated the number of shares that CVP can purchase to be 1,636,362.  

NOTE 9   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2015 the Company had an accumulated deficit
of $5,239,472 and working capital deficit of $2,265,686. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern.   The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Management s
Plans  

The Company maintains daily operations and
capital needs through the receipts of sales of product and from the proceeds received from the issuance of convertible promissory
notes. 

Management is developing a plan of action to
eliminate the Company s convertible notes payable that include conversion rights that may convert at a discount to the market
price of our common stock. Management plans to become cash flow positive from operations by the end of this fiscal year, therefore
eliminating any future cash burn. 

Part of management s plans include increases
in unit sales of our cabinets. As part of that initiative, in July 2015 the Company introduced our newest version of our Medicab.
The unit is more efficient and lower priced than its predecessor. 

Retailers in our wholesale program are able
to purchase our products for resale. While the Company s entire product line is available the program and product was designed
to allow for the retailer to carry a basic cabinet and work with their customer to custom design a cabinet that fits their needs. 

We are also working on introducing additional
product extensions, new products, and subscription based service offerings. We plan to introduce a higher level of automation options
as well as expand the offering of scalable packages and accessories. We have developed several innovative product enhancements
that we are considering incorporating to our line of products and we may seek to apply for intellectual property protection. An
increasing emphasis will be placed on supplies such as nutrients and grow medium which are consumed by system users with each grow
cycle and represent a captive recurring revenue opportunity. We are introducing an automated contact and reorder system for our
customer base to help grow this revenue stream. We are planning to expand our current line of LEDs for uses in cabinets and also
as a standalone offering for larger scale growers. We also plan to offer and expand our premium support services and education.
Support and education can be packaged as a monthly subscription service offering live support, advanced training, and even an auto
resupply of nutrients and grow media. 

Additionally, management s plans include
the establishment and development of wholly-owned separate stand-alone subsidiaries. There will be a separate subsidiary for technology
companies, media companies, manufacturing companies and intellectual property companies. The Company also plans to acquire cannabis
brands that are compatible with our risk guidelines, that have an operating history and that are cash-flow positive.

term sheet for the issuance of a $50,000 convertible preferred note in exchange for $50,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Standstill
and Forbearance Agreement with CVP, CVP had to consent to any additional debt financing proposals that the Company received. On
November 5, 2015, CVP notified the Company that they did not consent and would not consent to any debt transaction that had conversion
mechanics that vary with the market price of the Company s common stock. In addition CVP advised the Company that they would
longer be financing the operations of the Company. Subsequently, the Company has laid off all non-executive employee and has ceased
all marketing efforts including the closing of the Company s merchant account. 

NOTE 11   RESTATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The Company s previously issued financial
statements have been restated to reflect the correction as a result of the Company not previously measuring and re-measuring the
fair value of warrants issued in connection with a convertible promissory note (see Note 4) to CVP to purchase common stock and
to correct the per share fair value from $0.20 to $0.40 to reflect the fair value based on the most recent sale price of the Company s
common stock at the time the shares were granted.  

  The following tables
present the effects of the restatement adjustments on the affected line items in the previously reported statement of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the balance sheet as of June 30, 2015. There was no effect to the net
increase in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as the increase in the net loss was offset
by the decreases in the fair market value change on the warrants issued and the amortization of the discount. The Company determined
that the conversion feature of the convertible note did not meet the criteria of an embedded derivative and therefore the conversion
feature was not bi-furcated and accounted for as a derivative because the Company was a private company, there was no quoted price
and no active market for the Company s common stock. However, the exercise price of the warrant is subject to adjustment
if we issue or sell shares of our common stock for a consideration per share less than the exercise price, or issue options, warrants
or other securities convertible or exchange for shares of our common stock at a conversion price less than the exercise price
in the warrants. If either of these events should occur, the exercise price is reduced to the lowest price at which these securities
were issued or are exercisable. Therefore, the settlement of the warrants fails the fixed for fixed criteria of ASC 815 and they
are required to be recorded as a liability at their fair value on inception. The warrant liability is required to be re-measured
at its fair value on each reporting date with the changes in fair value recorded in the Company s Statement of Operations.
All related amounts have been restated as appropriate within these financial statements.  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

The Company makes cabinet based horticultural
systems. The design and production of our hydroponic and soil grow cabinets makes the process of growing in a self-contained cabinet
automated and simplified. Our mission is  to make hydroponic and soil growing simpler, more
efficient and a better value than other products found on the market.  Our product offerings are split into two categories:
(1) self-contained horticultural grow cabinets and (2) specifically constructed kits and packages offered to satisfy the DIY home
horticulturist, which involve a modular growing solution. 

The Company s line of grow cabinets consists
of three models, with variations of each model allowing consumers to select a cabinet that will suit their specific needs. In October
2010, we launched an initial prototype of our flagship product, the Earth Cab Pro hydroponic grow cabinet (the  ECP ).
Two other models, the Yielder Max and the MediCab Micro, round out our cabinet product line. 

The Company purchases cabinets, as well as
lights, filters and fans, from third party suppliers. Upon receipt of an order from a customer, the Company assembles the parts
into a  finished horticulture  cabinet for sale. We currently have no plans to manufacture cabinets but depending on
the costs of the components we purchase, labor, transportation and other costs associated with purchasing components, we may from
time to time investigate the possibility of manufacturing some of the purchased components. The design and production of our hydroponic
and soil grow cabinets make the process of growing in a self-contained cabinet automated and simplified. Our mission is to make
hydroponic and soil growing simpler, more efficient and a better value than other products found on the market. 

The Company views itself as a  pick and
shovel  assembler and distributor, providing the tools needed for successful growing operations, but never touching the actual
end product. The design and production of our innovative line of grow cabinets makes the process of growing a superior crop self-contained,
automated and simplified. Throughout the entire process, from seed to harvest, we are dedicated to giving growers the products,
services and knowledge to make each grow their best.

Capital Resources and Liquidity  

Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise
to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $17,724 compared to $61,472 as of December 31, 2014. At September 30, 2015 we had current liabilities of $2,369,293

liabilities are comprised principally of accounts payable, accrued expenses, note payable to a stockholder, derivative liabilities
and customer deposits.

September 30, 2014, of $709,250 of stock compensation expense, $92,484 of amortization of discounts on convertible notes and deferred

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2015, a net loss and net cash used in operating
activities for the reporting period then ended. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. 

The Company is attempting to produce sufficient
revenue to support its daily operations; however, the Company s cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds. 

The unaudited condensed financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

We have identified the following policies below
as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting
policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve making estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations.
For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and the best estimates routinely
require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. 

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying condensed financial statements
have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below, these adjustments
consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with a
reading of the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Interim results of operations for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year. Certain amounts from
the 2014 period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period. 

Emerging Growth Company  

We qualify as an  emerging
growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). Section 107 of the JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Inventory  

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or
market value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving
inventory is made based on management analysis or inventory levels and future sales forecasts. Inventory of $49,336 and $48,761
as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, was comprised of raw materials. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue
Recognition. ASC 605 requires that the following four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
The Company recognizes revenue during the period in which the product is shipped. 

Shipping and Handling  

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers
are recorded in sales. Shipping costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of sales. For the three and nine ended September
30, 2015 and 2014 the costs were as follows: 

Research and Development  

Expenditures for research and development
are charged to expense as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30 2015 and 2014, the costs were as follows:

The Company records advertising costs as incurred.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, advertising expense was as follows: 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable and convertible debt. The carrying
amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate
market interest rates of these instruments. The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

Earnings Per Share  

The Company reports earnings (loss) per share
in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities
outstanding during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, 14,287,500 shares of common stock underlying
convertible debt and warrants have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB and the SEC did not have, or are not believed by management to have, a material impact on the Company's present or
future financial statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report and they determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2015 due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation
of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company, we are unable
to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2015
