NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
AND HISTORY  

CAT9 Group Inc., (the  Company ) formerly
ANDES 4 Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 26, 2015, and has been inactive since
inception. The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other
business combination with a domestic or foreign business. 

On July 31, 2015, the sole officer and
director of the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) pursuant to which he entered into an agreement
to sell an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of his shares of the Company s common stock to Chongqing Field Industrial
Company Ltd. at an aggregate purchase price of $40,000. These shares represent 100% of the Company s issued and outstanding
common stock. Effective upon the closing date of the Share Purchase Agreement, August 12, 2015, the sole officer and director of
the Company executed the agreement and owned no shares of the Company s stock and Chongqing Field Industrial Company Ltd.
was the sole stockholder of the Company. 

On May 2, 2016, the Company entered
into Employee Agreements with Wenfa  Simon  Sun, its President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of
Directors, and MeiHong  Sanya  Qian, its Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement,
the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Wenfa  Simon  Sun, and 4,000,000 shares of restricted
common stock to MeiHong  Sanya  Qian. 

On May 3, 2016, the sole shareholder
of the Company, Chongqing Field Industrial Ltd., ( CQFI ) consented to a redemption of its 10,000,000 shares of common
stock at a price of $0.0001 per share for an aggregate redemption price of $1,000. As a result of this action by CQFI, management
of the Company now control 100% of the issued and outstanding shares. 

With the redemption and subsequent issuance
of the 10,000,000 shares of restricted common stock, the Company effected a change in its control and the new majority shareholders
are the current members of management of the Company. 

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES  

Basis of presentation   

 The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements of CAT9 Group Inc. have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission requirements for interim financial statements. Therefore, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. The financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements CAT9 Group Inc. in our Form 10-12G/A2 filed on September
8, 2015. 

The interim unaudited financial statements
present the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows CAT9 Group Inc. The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

[Index]  

 The interim financial information is unaudited. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the
results of operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in the financial statements. All such adjustments are
of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the full year. 

Use of estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires
the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information,
information that is currently available to the Company and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and cash equivalents   

 Cash and cash equivalents consist of
cash and short-term investments with original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality
financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds. The carrying value of those investments approximates fair value. 

Earnings (loss) per share   

 Basic earnings (loss) per common share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional
shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. There were no potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during the periods presented. 

Stock-based compensation   

 The Company accounts for equity instruments
issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) ASC 718-10, Compensation   Stock Compensation, and the conclusions reached by FASB ASC 505-50,
Equity   Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity
instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or
completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50. 

Income taxes   

 The Company follows Section 740-10-30
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment
date. 

[Index]  

 The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ) with regards to uncertainty income taxes.  Section 740-10-25 addresses
the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements.  Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured
based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting
in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.  The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized
income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 The Company has evaluated recent pronouncements
through Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) 2015-08 and believes that none of them will have a material impact on
the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying unaudited financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and had a deficit accumulated of $ 45,521
 as of September 30, 2016. The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities. The Company s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing,
the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment
of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company
do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties. 

NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

Preferred Stock   

 The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000
shares of $.0001 par value preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016, and no shares of preferred stock had been issued. 

Common Stock   

 The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000
shares of $.0001 par value common stock. As of September 30, 2016, and 10,000,000 shares were issued and outstanding respectively. 

Upon formation of the Company on January
26, 2015, the Board of Directors issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock for $1,000 in services to the founding shareholder of
the Company. In addition, the founding shareholder made a contribution of $3,839 to the Company for the period ended December 31,
2015, which is recorded as additional paid-in capital.

2015, the CEO advanced the Company $15,507 to pay for professional fees related to the Company s SEC filing expenses. The
advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due upon demand. 

During the period ended September 30,

During the period ended September 30,
2016, an officer for the Company contributed $7,900 to pay for professional fees related to the Company s SEC filing expenses.

NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In accordance with SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10)
management has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were available to be
issued on November 7, 2016 and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial
statements. 

[Table of Contents]  

   Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q (the  Report ).
This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases,
you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects, 
 plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential 
or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions
and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions
upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual
results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future
performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not
intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results 

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

On May 2, 2016, the Company entered
into Employee Agreements with Wenfa  Simon  Sun, its President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of
Directors, and MeiHong  Sanya  Qian, its Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement,
the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Wenfa  Simon  Sun, and 4,000,000 shares of restricted
common stock to MeiHong  Sanya  Qian. 

On May 3, 2016, the sole shareholder
of the Company, Chongqing Field Industrial Ltd., ( CQFI ) consented to a redemption of its 10,000,000 shares of common
stock at a price of $0.0001 per share for an aggregate redemption price of $1,000. As a result of this action by CQFI, management
of the Company now control 100% of the issued and outstanding shares. 

With the redemption and subsequent issuance
of the 10,000,000 shares of restricted common stock, the Company effected a change in its control and the new majority shareholders
are the current members of management of the Company. 

The Company will attempt to locate and
negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take
the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange (the  business combination ). In most instances
the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in locating or negotiating with any target business. 

The Company has not restricted its search
for any specific kind of businesses, and it may acquire a business which is in its preliminary stage, which is already in operation,
or in essentially any stage of its business life. It is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may
become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may
seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer. 

In implementing a structure for a particular
business acquisition, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement
with another corporation or entity. 

[Table of Contents]  

 It is anticipated that any securities issued in any
such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities
laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, the Company may agree to register all or a part
of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs,
it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has
consummated a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which
may develop in the Company's securities may depress the market value of the Company's securities in the future if such a market
develops, of which there is no assurance. 

    The
Company will participate in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Negotiations
with a target company will likely focus on the percentage of the Company which the target company shareholders would acquire in
exchange for their shareholdings. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require
certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of
closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous
other terms. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage
of shares held by the Company's shareholders at such time. 

Results of Operations   

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues  

We have had no revenues to date. We
are completely dependent upon the willingness of our management to fund our initial operations by way of loans from our Chief Executive
Officer, shareholders and/or others. 

Operating Expenses  

General and administrative expenses
were $7,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,082 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. General
and administrative expenses consist of professional fees and have increased due to the requirements of required SEC filings. 

Net Loss  

Our net loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $7,900 compared to $6,082 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss is due
to the increased professional fees as discussed above. 

[  Table of Contents]  

  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the period January 26, 2015 (inception) through September 30, 2015  

Revenues  

We have had no revenues to date. We
are completely dependent upon the willingness of our management to fund our initial operations by way of loans from our Chief Executive
Officer, shareholders and/or others. 

Operating Expenses  

General and administrative expenses
were $25,175 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11,548 for the period January 26, 2015 (inception)
through September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses consist of professional fees and have increased due to the requirements
of required SEC filings. 

Net Loss  

Our net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $25,175 compared to $11,548 for the period January 26, 2015 (inception) through September 30,
2015. The increase in net loss is due to the increased professional fees as discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The accompanying unaudited financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the
Company as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $0 and total liabilities of $15,507. Our cash flows from operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in cash used of $25,175. Our current cash balance and cash flow
from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund our operations. Our cash flow provided by financing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,175 from contributed capital by a related party. The Company has a working capital
deficiency of $15,507 and a shareholders  deficit of $ 45,521 at September 30, 2016. 

During the period ended December 31,
2015, the CEO advanced the Company $15,507 to pay for professional fees related to the Company s SEC filing expenses. The
advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due upon demand. 

During the period ended September 30,
2016, a consultant for the Company contributed $17,275 to pay for professional fees related to the Company s SEC filing expenses.
The amount has been credited to paid in capital. 

Over the next 12 months we expect to
expend approximately $10,000 in cash for legal, accounting and related services. Cash used for other expenditures is expected to
be minimal. We hope to be able to attract suitable investors for our business plan, which will not require us to use our cash,
although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts. 

[Table of Contents]  

 We expect to be able to secure capital through advances
from our Chief Executive Officer, shareholders and others in order to pay expenses such as organizational costs, filing fees,
accounting fees and legal fees. We believe it will be difficult to secure capital in the future because we have no assets to secure
debt and there is currently no trading market for our securities. We will need additional capital in the next twelve months and
if we cannot raise such capital on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our operations or terminate our business entirely. 

The inability to obtain financing or
generate sufficient cash from operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures for acquiring suitable partners or
otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible
debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds
through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our
common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove
to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash,
which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders. 

Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure
Requirements  

Our controlling shareholders expect
to advance us additional funding for operating costs in order to implement our business plan. The funds are loaned to the Company
as required to pay amounts owed by the Company. As such, our operating capital is currently limited to the resources of our controlling
shareholders. The loans from our controlling shareholders are unsecured and non-interest bearing and have no set terms of repayment.
We anticipate receiving additional capital once we are able to have our securities actively trading on a public exchange. There
is no guarantee our stock will develop a market on that public exchange. 

Plan of Operation and Funding  

We do not currently engage in enough
business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

(i)
Filing of Exchange Act reports, and 

   (ii)
Costs relating to developing our business plan 

We believe we will be able to meet these
costs through amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our controlling shareholder.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 As required by Rule
13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based upon that evaluation, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
as of the end of the period covered by this report due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting,
which is described below. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting  

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and
effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect
to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

We plan to take steps to enhance and
improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form
10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement
the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate
segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing
to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may
be adversely affected in a material manner. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
