  1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
  Description of Business 
  The use of the terms  CEC Entertainment,  the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  throughout these unaudited notes to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements refer to CEC Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  We currently operate and franchise Chuck E. Cheese s and Peter Piper Pizza family dining and entertainment centers (also referred to as  stores ) in a total of   47   states and   12   foreign countries and territories. Our stores provide our guests with a variety of family entertainment and dining alternatives. All of our stores utilize a consistent restaurant-entertainment format that features both family dining and entertainment areas with a mix of food, beverages, entertainment and merchandise. The economic characteristics, products and services, preparation processes, distribution methods and types of customers are substantially similar for each of our stores. Therefore, we aggregate each store s operating performance into one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The Company has a controlling financial interest in International Association of CEC Entertainment, Inc. (the  Association ), a variable interest entity ( VIE ). The Association primarily administers the collection and disbursement of funds (the  Association Funds ) used for advertising, entertainment and media programs that benefit both us and our Chuck E. Cheese s franchisees. We and our franchisees are required to contribute a percentage of gross sales to these funds and could be required to make additional contributions to fund any deficits that may be incurred by the Association. We include the Association in our Consolidated Financial Statements, as we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of its variable interests because we (a) have the power to direct the majority of its significant operating activities; (b) provide it unsecured lines of credit; and (c) own the majority of the stores that benefit from the Association s advertising, entertainment and media expenditures. The assets, liabilities and operating results of the Association are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Because the Association Funds are required to be segregated and used for specified purposes, we do not reflect franchisee contributions to the Association Funds as revenue, but rather record franchisee contributions as an offset to reported advertising expenses. Our contributions to the Association Funds are eliminated in consolidation. Contributions to the advertising, entertainment and media funds from our franchisees were   $1.7 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. Cash balances held by the Association are restricted for use in our advertising, entertainment and media programs, and are recorded as  Restricted cash  on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The preparation of these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Interim Financial Statements 
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as of   October 2, 2016   and for the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   are unaudited and are presented in accordance with the requirements for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP. In the opinion of management, the Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all necessary reclassification adjustments to conform prior year results to the current period presentation. 
  We reclassified   $1.5 million   and   $3.6 million   of litigation costs related to the Merger (as defined in Note 12.  Commitments and Contingencies ) in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the   three and nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , respectively, from  General and administrative expenses  to  Transaction, severance and litigation related costs  to conform to the current period s presentation.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Consolidated results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC on   March 2, 2016  .  
  Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  
  Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted:    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This new standard introduces a new lease model that requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The new guidance will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (i.e., calendar periods beginning on January 1, 2019). Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04,   Liabilities - Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20).   This amendment provides a narrow scope exception to   Liabilities - Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20)   that requires breakage for those liabilities to be accounted for in accordance with the breakage guidance in   Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606)  . There is currently no guidance in GAAP, or pending guidance, regarding the derecognition of prepaid stored-value product liabilities within the scope of the amendments in this update. Under the new guidance, if an entity expects to be entitled to a breakage amount for a liability resulting from the sale of a prepaid stored-value product, the entity shall derecognize the amount related to the expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur. If an entity does not expect to be entitled to a breakage amount for a prepaid stored-value product, the entity shall derecognize the amount related to the breakage when the likelihood of the product holder exercising its remaining rights becomes remote. This change to an entity s estimated breakage amount shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  . This amendment will require that (i) all excess tax benefits and deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement, (ii) the tax effects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and (iii) an entity recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period or not. On the statement of cash flows excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. This amendment allows an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. The threshold for an award to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rate in applicable jurisdictions, and the cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Nonpublic entities can make an accounting policy election to apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions that meet certain conditions. For the Company, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. We do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  . This amendment updates the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property, changing the FASB s previous proposals on right-of-use licenses and contractual restrictions. For an entity that licenses intellectual property, the amount or timing of revenue recognition and the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for intellectual property licenses, including the application of the sale- and usage-based royalties exception, may be significantly different from current practice. Additionally, an entity will need to evaluate which contractual restrictions are attributes of a license and which give rise to separate performance obligations. This amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. Early application is permitted, but only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods therein. We do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

  (Unaudited) 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . This amendment changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking  expected loss  model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities may early adopt the amendments in this update as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).   This amendment reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Current GAAP either is unclear or does not include specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues addressed in this amendment, including (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (ii) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (iii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle; and (iv) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination. The amendment is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  2. Property and Equipment: 
  Total depreciation and amortization expense was   $29.9 million   and   $29.4 million   for the   three months ended October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, of which   $2.2 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, was included in  General and administrative expenses  in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
  Total depreciation and amortization expense was   $90.2 million   and   $89.6 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, of which   $5.1 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively, was included in  General and administrative expenses  in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
  Asset Impairments 
  During the three and nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , we recognized an asset impairment charge of   $0.8 million   primarily related to four stores. During the three and nine months ended   September 27, 2015  , we recognized an asset impairment charge of   $0.9 million   primarily related to four stores. We closed two of these stores. These impairment charges were the result of a decline in the stores  financial performance, primarily related to various economic factors in the markets in which the stores are located. As of   October 2, 2016  , the aggregate carrying value of the property and equipment at impaired stores, after the impairment charges, was   $0.6 million   for stores impaired in 2016. 
   
  3. Intangible Assets, Net:  
  The following table presents our indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets at   October 2, 2016  :

           (1) 
    In connection with the Merger and the acquisition of Peter Piper Pizza ( PPP ), we also recorded unfavorable lease liabilities of   $10.2 million   and   $3.9 million  , respectively, which are included in  Other current liabilities  and  Other noncurrent liabilities  in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts are being amortized over a weighted average life of   10 years  , and are included in  Rent expense  in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
     Amortization expense related to favorable lease agreements was   $0.5 million   for both the   three months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   and   $1.5 million   for both the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , and is included in  Rent expense  in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

agreements was   $0.5 million   for both the   three months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , and   $1.5 million   for both the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   and is included in  General and administrative expenses  in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
   
  4. Accounts Payable: 
  Accounts payable consisted of the following as of the dates presented: 

The book overdraft balance represents checks issued but not yet presented to banks. 
   
  5. Indebtedness and Interest Expense: 
   Our long-term debt consisted of the following as of the dates presented: 

Secured Credit Facilities 
   Our Secured Credit Facilities include (i) a   $760.0 million   term loan facility with a maturity date of February 14, 2021 (the  term loan facility ) and (ii) a   $150.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 14, 2019, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility and a   $30.0 million   swingline loan sub-facility (the  revolving credit facility  and together with the term loan facility, the  Secured Credit Facilities ). The Secured Credit Facilities require scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan facility equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loan facility from   July 2014   to   December 2020  , with the remaining balance paid at maturity,   February 14, 2021  . As of   October 2, 2016   we had   $9.9 million   of letters of credit issued but undrawn under the Secured Credit Facilities. 
  The term loan was issued net of   $3.8 million   of original issue discount. We also paid   $17.8 million   and   $3.4 million   in debt financing costs related to the term loan facility and revolving credit facility, respectively, which we capitalized in  Bank indebtedness and other long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs  on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The original issue discount and deferred financing costs are amortized over the lives of the facilities and are included in  Interest expense  on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
  Borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowings, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a   1.00%   floor in the case of term loans or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.50%  ; (ii) the prime rate of Deutsche

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Bank AG New York Branch; and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus   1.00%  , in each case plus an applicable margin. The base applicable margin is   3.25%   with respect to LIBOR borrowings and   2.25%   with respect to base rate borrowings under the 
  term loan facility and base rate borrowings and swingline borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The applicable margin 
  for borrowings under the term loan facility is subject to one step down from   3.25%   to   3.00%   based on our net first lien senior 
  secured leverage ratio, and the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to two step-downs 
  from   3.25%   to   3.00%   and   2.75%   based on our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio. 
  During the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , the federal funds rate ranged from   0.25%   to   0.41%  , the prime rate was   3.5%   and the one-month LIBOR ranged from   0.42%   to   0.55%  . 
  The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under our Secured Credit Facilities was   4.6%    for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , which includes amortization of debt issuance costs related to our Secured Credit Facilities, amortization of our term loan facility original issue discount and commitment and other fees related to our Secured Credit Facilities.  
  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility with respect to the unutilized commitments thereunder. The base applicable commitment fee rate under the revolving credit facility is   0.50%   per annum and is subject to one step-down from   0.50%   to   0.375%   based on our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio. We are also required to pay customary agency fees, as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer s customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to   0.125%   per annum on the daily stated amount of such letter of credit. 
  Effective March 4, 2016, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities stepped down from   3.25%   to   3.00%   and the applicable commitment fee rate stepped down from   0.5%   to   0.375%  .  
  All obligations under the Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Queso Holdings Inc. ( Parent ) on a limited-recourse basis and each of our existing and future direct and indirect material, wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations are secured by a pledge of our capital stock and substantially all of our assets and those of each subsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the subsidiary guarantors and   65%   of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to exceptions. Such security interests consist of first priority liens with respect to the collateral. 
  The Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default, which limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions with respect to our capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; change our lines of business; restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens; change our fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements. 
  Our revolving credit facility includes a springing financial maintenance covenant that requires our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed   6.25   to   1.00   (the ratio of consolidated net debt secured by first-priority liens on the collateral to the last twelve months  EBITDA, as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). The covenant will be tested quarterly if the revolving credit facility is more than   30%   drawn (excluding outstanding letters of credit) and will be a condition to drawings under the revolving credit facility that would result in more than   30%   drawn thereunder. 
  We were in compliance with the debt covenants in effect as of   October 2, 2016   for both the Secured Credit Facilities and the senior notes.  
  Senior Unsecured Debt 
  Our senior unsecured debt consists of   $255.0 million   aggregate principal amount borrowings of   8.000%   Senior Notes due 2022 (the  senior notes ) and maturing on February 15, 2022. The senior notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ), do not bear legends restricting their transfer and are not entitled to registration rights under our registration rights agreement. On or after February 15, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at certain redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes (the  indenture ). Prior to February 15, 2017, we may redeem (i) up to   40%   of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a price equal to   108%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) some or all of the notes at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable  make-whole  premium set forth in the indenture.

We paid   $6.4 million   in debt issuance costs related to the senior notes, which we capitalized in  Bank indebtedness and other long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs  on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the senior notes and are included in  Interest expense  on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
  Our obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our present and future direct and indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our Secured Credit Facilities. 
  The indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and restrict dividends from our subsidiaries. 
  The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on borrowings under our senior notes was   8.3%   for both the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , which included amortization of debt issuance costs and other fees related to our senior notes.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense consisted of the following for the periods presented:   

__________________ 
  (1)    Includes amortization of original issue discount. 
  The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our combined borrowings under our Secured Credit Facilities and senior notes was   5.6%   for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , and   5.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  .

6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  
  The following table presents information on our financial instruments as of the periods presented:  

_________________ 
  (1)    Excluding net deferred financing costs. 
  Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, our Secured Credit Facilities and our senior notes. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of their short maturities. The estimated fair value of our Secured Credit Facilities' term loan facility and senior notes was determined by using the respective average of the ask and bid price of our outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility and the senior notes as of the nearest open market date preceding the reporting period end. The average of the ask and bid price are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  During the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , there were no significant transfers among Level 1, 2 or 3 fair value determinations.  
   
  7. Income Taxes:  
  Our income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following for the periods presented: 

_________________ 
  (1)    Including foreign taxes withheld. 
  Our effective income tax rates for the   three and nine-month periods   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the favorable impact of employment-related federal and state income tax credits,

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

the favorable impact of adjustments related to the prior year s estimated tax provision versus actuals, the unfavorable impact of non-deductible litigation and settlement costs related to the Merger, and the unfavorable impact of increases in the liability for uncertain tax positions.  
  Our quarterly provision for income taxes has historically been calculated using the annual effective rate method which applies an estimated annual effective tax rate to pre-tax income or loss. However, for the   three and nine-month periods   ended   October 2, 2016  , we have used the actual year-to-date effective tax rate (the  discrete method ), as required by ASC 740-270,   Accounting for Income Taxes-Interim Reporting   when a reliable estimate cannot be made. We believe that at this time, the use of the discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method due to significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and projected annual pre-tax income or loss which occurs when projected pre-tax income or loss nears a relatively small amount in comparison to the differences between income and deductions determined for financial statement purposes versus income tax purposes. Using the discrete method, we have determined our current and deferred income tax expense as if the interim period were an annual period.  
   Our liability for uncertain tax positions (excluding interest and penalties) was   $3.7 million   and   $3.3 million   as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively, and if recognized would decrease our provision for income taxes by   $1.2 million  . Within the next twelve months, we could settle or otherwise conclude income tax audits. As such, it is reasonably possible that the liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as   $0.2 million   as a result of settlements with certain taxing authorities and expiring statutes of limitations within the next twelve months. 
  Total accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , was   $1.0 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we include current interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in  Accrued interest,  current penalties in  Accrued expenses  and noncurrent accrued interest and penalties in  Other noncurrent liabilities.  
   
  8. Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:  
  The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan provides Parent authority to grant equity incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock bonus awards or performance compensation awards to certain directors, officers or employees of the Company. A summary of the options outstanding under the equity incentive plan as of   October 2, 2016   and the activity for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   is presented below:  

__________________ 
  (1)    The weighted average exercise price reflects the original grant date fair value per option as adjusted for the dividend payment made in August 2015. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , we had   $2.5 million   of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested options, net of expected forfeitures, which is expected to be amortized over the remaining weighted-average period of   3.0   years. 
  The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the associated tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented:

Capitalized stock-based compensation costs attributable to our store development projects are included in  Property and equipment, net  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

11. Related Party Transactions: 
    
  CEC Entertainment reimburses Apollo Management, L.P. for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with travel and Board of Directors related expenses. Expense reimbursements by CEC Entertainment to Apollo Management, L.P. totaled   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and are included in  General and administrative expenses  in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
    
  In June 2016, CEC Entertainment entered into an agreement with an Apollo portfolio company to manage CEC Entertainment s print services and processes. We accrued payments totaling less than   $0.1 million   in connection with this agreement during the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2016  . 
   
  12. Commitments and Contingencies:  
  Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time, we are involved in various inquiries, investigations, claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. These matters typically involve claims from customers, employees or other third parties involved in operational issues common to the retail, restaurant and entertainment industries. Such matters typically represent actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, taxation, employment, employee benefits, personal injuries and other matters. A number of such claims may exist at any given time, and there are currently a number of claims and legal proceedings pending against us. 
  In the opinion of our management, after consultation with legal counsel, the amount of liability with respect to claims or proceedings currently pending against us is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. All necessary loss accruals based on the probability and estimate of loss have been recorded. 
    
  Employment-Related Litigation:   On January 27, 2014, former CEC employee Franchesca Ford filed a purported class action lawsuit against the Company in San Francisco County Superior Court, California (the  Ford Litigation ). The plaintiff claims to represent other similarly-situated hourly non-exempt employees and former employees of the Company in California who were employed from January 27, 2010 to the present, and alleges violations of California state wage and hour laws. In March 2014, the Company removed the Ford Litigation to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, and subsequently defeated the plaintiff s motion to remand the case to California state court. In May 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit on a class-wide basis. The settlement would result in the plaintiffs  dismissal of all claims asserted in the action, as well as certain related but unasserted claims, and grant of complete releases, in exchange for the Company s settlement payment. On March 24, 2016, the Court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the class settlement. At hearing on August 11, 2016, the Court took the parties  settlement agreement under advisement, but has not yet issued a ruling on final approval. The settlement of this action is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
  On October 10, 2014, former store General Manager Richard Sinohui filed a purported class action lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court of California, Riverside County (the  Sinohui Litigation ), claiming to represent other similarly-situated current and former General Managers of the Company in California during the period October 10, 2010 to the present. The lawsuit sought an unspecified amount in damages and to certify a class based on allegations that CEC wrongfully classified current and former California General Managers as exempt from overtime protections; that such General Managers worked more than 40 hours a week without overtime premium pay, paid rest periods, and paid meal periods; and that the Company failed to provide accurate itemized wage statements or to pay timely wages upon separation from employment, in violation of the California Labor Code, California Business and Professions Code, and the applicable Wage Order issued by the California Industrial Welfare Commission. The plaintiff also alleged that the Company failed to reimburse General Managers for certain business expenses, including for personal cell phone usage and mileage, in violation of the California Labor Code; he also asserted a claim for civil penalties under the California Private Attorneys General Act ( PAGA ). On December 5, 2014, the Company removed the Sinohui Litigation to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division. On March 16, 2016, the Court issued an order denying in part and granting in part Plaintiff s Motion for Class Certification. Specifically, the Court denied Plaintiff s motion to the extent that he sought to certify a class on Plaintiff s misclassification and wage statement claims, but certified a class with respect to Plaintiff s claims that the Company had wrongfully failed to reimburse him for cell phone expenses and/or mileage. On June 14, 2016, the Court dismissed Sinohui s PAGA claim. The parties participated in mediation in October 2016, but were unable to reach an agreement on settlement at that time. Trial is currently scheduled for June 2017. We believe the Company has meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and intend to vigorously defend it. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, we currently believe that the final resolution of this action will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources.

Litigation Related to the Merger:   Following the January 16, 2014 announcement that the Company had entered into a merger agreement (the  Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which an entity controlled by Apollo Global Management, LLC and its subsidiaries merged with and into CEC Entertainment, with CEC Entertainment surviving the merger (the  Merger ),   four   putative shareholder class actions were filed in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas, on behalf of purported stockholders of the Company, against the Company, its directors, Apollo, Parent and Merger Sub (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. These actions were consolidated into one action in March 2014, and on July 21, 2015, a consolidated class action petition was filed as the operative consolidated complaint, asserting claims against CEC Entertainment and its former directors, adding The Goldman Sachs Group ( Goldman Sachs ) as a defendant, and removing all Apollo entities as defendants ( Consolidated Class Action Petition ). The Consolidated Class Action Petition alleges that the Company s directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company s stockholders in connection with their consideration and approval of the Merger Agreement by, among other things, conducting a deficient sales process, agreeing to an inadequate tender price, agreeing to certain provisions in the Merger Agreement, and filing materially deficient disclosures regarding the transaction. The Consolidated Class Action Petition also alleges that   two   members of the Company s board who also served as the senior managers of the Company had material conflicts of interest and that Goldman Sachs aided and abetted the board s breaches as a result of various conflicts of interest facing the bank. The Consolidated Class Action Petition seeks, among other things, to recover damages, attorneys  fees and costs. On March 23, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing on the defendants  Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Petition, and the parties are currently awaiting the Court s ruling. The Court has not yet set this case for trial. The Company believes the Consolidated Class Action Petition is without merit and intends to defend it vigorously. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of the consolidated matter, we currently believe that the final resolution of the action will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
  Peter Piper, Inc. Litigation:    On September 8, 2016, Diane Jacobson filed a purported class action lawsuit against Peter Piper, Inc. ( Peter Piper ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, Tucson Division (the  Jacobson Litigation ). The plaintiff claims to represent other similarly-situated consumers who, within the two years prior to the filing of the Jacobson Litigation, received a printed receipt on which Peter Piper allegedly printed more than the last five digits of the consumer s credit/debit card number, in violation of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. We believe Peter Piper has meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and intend to vigorously defend it. Since the litigation is in its earliest stages, however, the Company does not have sufficient information to reach a good faith determination on Peter Piper s potential liability or exposure in the event that its defense is unsuccessful.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  As used in this report, the terms  CEC Entertainment,  the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to CEC Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to provide the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD A should be read in conjunction with (i) our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1.  Financial Statements  of this report and (ii) Part II, Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and Part II, Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC on   March 2, 2016  .

  Executive Summary 
  We operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except for a 53 week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ending   January 1, 2017   will consist of 52 weeks and our   fiscal year ended     January 3, 2016   consisted of 53 weeks. As a result of the 53 week fiscal year in   2015  , our   2016   fiscal year began one calendar week later than our   2015   fiscal year. In order to provide useful information and to better analyze our business, we have provided below comparable store sales presented on both a fiscal week basis and calendar week basis. Comparable store sales growth for the   first nine months of the year   on a calendar week basis compares the results for the period from   January 4, 2016   through   October 2, 2016   (weeks 1 through 39 of our   2016   fiscal year) to the results for the period from   January 5, 2015   through   September 27, 2015   (weeks 2 through 40 of our   2015   fiscal year). For the   third quarter  , comparable store sales growth on a calendar week basis compares the results for the period from   July 3, 2016   through   October 2, 2016   (weeks 27 through 39 of our   2016   fiscal year) to the results for the period from   July 5, 2015   through   September 27, 2015   (weeks 28 through 40 of our   2015   fiscal year). We believe comparable store sales growth calculated on a same calendar week basis is more indicative of the operating trends in our business. However, we also recognize that comparable store sales growth calculated on a fiscal week basis is a useful measure when analyzing year-over-year changes in our financial statements. 
  Third Quarter     2016   Overview: 
               
    Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) was   $49.5 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $53.4 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  . For our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Overview of Operations 
  We currently operate and franchise family dining and entertainment centers under the names  Chuck E. Cheese s  and  Peter Piper Pizza  in   47   states and   12   foreign countries and territories. Our stores provide our guests with a variety of family entertainment and dining alternatives. Our family leisure offerings include video games, skill games, rides, musical and comical shows and other attractions along with tokens, tickets and prizes for kids. Our wholesome family dining offerings are centered on made-to-order pizzas, salads, sandwiches, wings, appetizers, beverages and desserts.  
  The following table summarizes information regarding the number of Company-owned and franchised stores for the periods presented: 

__________________ 
    
           (1) 
    The number of new and closed Company-owned stores during the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015   included   one   store that was relocated. 
              (2) 
    The number of new and closed franchise stores during the   three and nine months ended     September 27, 2015   included   one   and   two   stores, respectively, that were relocated.  
              (3) 
    The number of new and closed stores during the   three and nine months ended     September 27, 2015   included   one   and   three   stores, respectively, that were relocated. 
     Comparable store sales.   We define  comparable store sales  as the sales for our domestic Company-owned stores that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or acquired stores we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of fiscal year   2016  . Comparable store sales is a key performance indicator used within our industry and is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends. Our comparable store sales do not reflect the impact of deferred revenue resulting from unused game credits that were purchased on our proprietary PlayPass card system and that we believe our guests will utilize in the future. 
  Revenues.   Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-owned stores ( Company store sales ), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play tokens, game play credits on game cards, and merchandise. A portion of our Company store sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage and game tokens ( Package Deals ), which we promote through in-store menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. We allocate the revenues recognized from the sale of our Package Deals and coupons between  Food and beverage sales  and  Entertainment and merchandise sales  based upon the price charged for each component when it is sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component is not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component s fair value. 
  Food and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, as well as the portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone game token and game play credit sales, as well as a portion of revenues allocated from Package Deals and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise. 
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

Franchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise store s sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised stores, as well as earn fees from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. We recognize development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise store has opened and we have substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a store. 
  Company store operating costs.   Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-owned stores. These costs and expenses are listed and described below: 
             
    Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers; 
                
    Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers, as well as the cost of tickets dispensed to customers; 
                
    Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for store personnel; 
                
    Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are directly related to our Company-owned stores  property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment; 
                
    Rent expense includes lease costs for Company-owned stores, excluding common occupancy costs (e.g., common area maintenance ( CAM ) charges and property taxes); and 
                
    Other store operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, CAM charges, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, store asset disposal gains and losses and all other costs directly related to the operation of a store. 
     The  Cost of food and beverage  and  Cost of entertainment and merchandise  mentioned above exclude any allocation of (a) store employee payroll, related payroll taxes and benefit costs; (b) depreciation and amortization expense; (c) rent expense; and (d) other direct store operating expenses associated with the operation of our Company-owned stores. We believe that presenting store-level labor costs, depreciation and amortization expense, rent expense and other store operating expenses in the aggregate provides the most informative financial reporting presentation. Our rationale for excluding such costs is as follows: 
             
    our store employees are trained to sell and attend to both our dining and entertainment operations. We believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate labor costs between  Food and beverage sales  and  Entertainment and merchandise sales  and 
                
    while certain assets are individually dedicated to either our food service operations or game activities, we also have significant capital investments in shared depreciating assets, such as leasehold improvements, point-of-sale systems and showroom fixtures. Therefore, we believe it would be difficult and potentially misleading to allocate depreciation and amortization expense or rent expense between  Food and beverage sales  and  Entertainment and merchandise sales.  
      Cost of food and beverage  and  Cost of entertainment and merchandise,  as a percentage of Company store sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and by the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings.  Entertainment and merchandise sales  have higher margins than  Food and beverage sales.  
  Advertising expense.   Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising and consulting fees, partially offset by contributions from our franchisees. 
  General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, back-office support systems and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-owned stores. 
  Adjusted EBITDA.   We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our senior notes and/or our Secured Credit Facilities (see discussion of our senior notes and Secured Credit Facilities under  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing ). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate our performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information about certain trends, material non-cash items and unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items.

Seasonality and Variation in Quarterly Results 
  Our operating results fluctuate seasonally due to the timing of school vacations, holidays and changing weather conditions. As a result, we typically generate higher sales volumes during the first quarter of each fiscal year. School operating schedules, holidays and weather conditions may affect sales volumes in some operating regions differently than others. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

  Three months ended October 2, 2016   Compared to the   Three months ended September 27, 2015    
  Revenues 
  Company store sales   increased     $6.7 million  , or   3.1%  , to   $223.7 million   during the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $217.0 million   during the   third quarter of 2015  . On a same calendar week basis comparable store sales     increased     3.5%  . On a fiscal week basis, comparable store sales   increased     3.7%   during the   third quarter of 2016  . Company store sales for the third quarter of 2016 were impacted by approximately   $0.6 million   of incremental deferred revenue as a result of the implementation of our proprietary PlayPass card system and the initial recognition of   $2.1 million   in breakage revenue in the third quarter of 2015 on unredeemed Chuck E. Cheese s gift card balances sold by third parties.  
  Company Store Operating Costs 
  The cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company store sales, was   15.0%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   15.2%   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The   decrease   in the cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise on a percentage basis in the   third quarter of 2016   was primarily due to a decrease in our commodity prices.   
  Labor expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were   27.6%   in both the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  . We were able to offset increased minimum wage rates in certain states over the past year with improved labor management.

Other store operating expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were   17.3%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   16.9%   in the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily due to an increase in preopening expenses related to new stores, higher IT and technology support costs, and favorable self-insurance expense associated with reserve adjustments to general liability claims in 2015. 
  Advertising Expense 
  Advertising expense was   $11.5 million   during the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $10.3 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . As a percentage of Total revenues, advertising expense was   5.0%   and   4.6%  , respectively, during the   third quarter of 2016   and the   third quarter of 2015  . The   third quarter of 2016   reflects increased advertising relative to the   third quarter of 2015   as a result of planned shifts in spending between quarters during   2016  . 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses were   $17.3 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $14.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The   increase   in general and administrative expenses in the   third quarter of 2016   is primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation as a result of higher sales and profit performance and a   $0.8 million     increase   in depreciation related to corporate assets placed in service throughout   2015   and   2016   primarily related to our IT initiatives. 
  Income Taxes 
  Our effective income tax rate of   48.7%   for the   third quarter of 2016   and   32.0%   for the   third quarter of 2015   differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the favorable impact of employment-related federal and state income tax credits, the favorable impact of adjustments related to the prior year s estimated tax provision versus actuals, the unfavorable impact of non-deductible litigation and settlement costs related to the Merger, and the unfavorable impact of increases in the liability for uncertain tax provisions. Our provision for income taxes for the   third quarter of 2016   was calculated using the year-to-date effective tax rate (the  discrete  method), whereas the provision for income taxes for the   third quarter of 2015   was calculated using the annual effective rate method. 
   
  Nine months ended October 2, 2016   Compared to   Nine months ended September 27, 2015 
  Revenues 
  Company store sales   increased     $19.3 million  , or   2.8%  , to   $705.6 million   during the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   $686.3 million   during the   first nine months of 2015  . On a same calendar week basis comparable store sales   increased     4.1%  . On a fiscal week basis, comparable store sales   increased     2.9%  , primarily due to the effect of an additional operating week in our   2015   fiscal year, which caused the seasonally strong week between the Christmas and New Year s holidays to shift into the   fourth quarter   of   2015  . Company store sales were also impacted by approximately $0.9 million of incremental deferred revenue as a result of the implementation of our proprietary PlayPass card system. 
  Company Store Operating Costs 
  The cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company store sales, was   15.0%   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   14.8%   in the   first nine months of 2015  . The   increase   in the cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise on a percentage basis in the   first nine months of 2016   was impacted by an increase in promotional merchandise giveaways during the first half of 2016. 
  Labor expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were   27.1%   during the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   27.2%   in the first nine months of   2015  . Labor expenses on a percentage basis in the   first nine months of 2016   reflect improved labor management, as we were able to minimize additional labor hours required to serve the increased number of guests visiting our stores, offset by an increase in the average hourly wage rate due to increases in minimum wage rates in certain states over the past year. 
  Other store operating expenses, as a percentage of Total company store sales, were   15.9%   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   15.4%   in the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to favorable self-insurance expense associated with reserve adjustments to general liability claims in 2015, higher IT and technology support costs, and asset write offs primarily attributable to games being taken out of service in connection with scheduled game refreshes in our stores. 
  Advertising Expense

     Table of Contents  

Advertising expense was   $36.8 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   $36.3 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  . As a percentage of Total revenues, Advertising expense was   5.1%   and   5.2%   for the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   first nine months of 2016   reflects an   increase   in digital advertising partially offset by a decrease in national media costs. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses were   $51.2 million   for the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   $48.6 million   for the   first nine months of 2015  . General and administrative expenses in the   first nine months of 2016   reflect an increase in professional fees primarily related to IT and other corporate initiatives, an increase in incentive compensation as a result of higher sales and profit performance, and a   $1.5 million     increase   in depreciation related to corporate corporate assets placed in service throughout   2015   and   2016   IT initiatives, offset by a decrease in PPP integration costs and labor related litigation costs. 
  Income Taxes 
  Our effective income tax rate of   41.8%   for the   first nine months of 2016   and   66.8%   for the   first nine months of 2015   differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the favorable impact of employment-related federal and state income tax credits, the favorable impact of adjustments related to the prior year s estimated tax provision versus actuals, the unfavorable impact of non-deductible litigation and settlement costs related to the Merger, and the unfavorable impact of increases in the liability for uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes for the   first nine months of 2016   was calculated using the actual year-to-date effective tax rate (the  discrete method ), whereas the provision for income taxes for the   first nine months of 2015   was calculated using the annual effective tax rate method. 
   
  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview of Liquidity  
  We finance our business activities through cash flows provided by our operations. The primary components of working capital are as follows: 
             
    our store customers pay for their purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale and the cash from these sales is typically received before our related accounts payable to suppliers and employee payroll become due; 
                
    frequent inventory turnover results in a limited investment required in inventories; and 
                
    our accounts payable are generally due within five to 30 days. 
     As a result of these factors, our requirement for working capital is not significant and we are able to operate with a net working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets). 
  Sources and Uses of Cash  
  The following tables present summarized consolidated cash flow information that we believe is helpful in evaluating our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the periods presented: 

35 

     Table of Contents  

Cash and cash equivalents as of   October 2, 2016   includes   $7.0 million   of undistributed income from our Canadian subsidiary that we consider to be permanently invested. 
  Cash that is held by the Association and restricted for use in our advertising, entertainment and media funds was   $0.2 million   as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  Sources and Uses of Cash -   Nine months ended October 2, 2016   Compared to the   Nine months ended September 27, 2015    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $111.3 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   compared to   $88.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an improvement in our results from operations and fluctuations in our working capital, partially offset by the payment of a Merger related litigation settlement. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $74.9 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   compared to   $60.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . Net cash used in investing activities in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   relates primarily to store related capital expenditures. The increase for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 27, 2015   is primarily related to our PlayPass initiative. 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $7.5 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016   and related primarily to principal payments on our term loan and other lease related obligations. During the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , we declared and paid a dividend of $70.0 million, as well as making the scheduled principal payments on our term loan. 
  Debt Financing  
  Secured Credit Facilities 
  Our Secured Credit Facilities include (i) a $760.0 million term loan facility with a maturity date of February 14, 2021 (the  term loan facility ) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 14, 2019, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility and a $30.0 million swingline loan sub-facility (the  revolving credit facility  and together with the term loan facility, the  Secured Credit Facilities ). The Secured Credit Facilities require scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan facility equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loan facility from   July 2014   to   December 2020  , with the balance paid at maturity. As of   October 2, 2016   we had   $9.9 million   of letters of credit issued but undrawn under the Secured Credit Facilities.  
  All borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties. 
  Borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowings, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a   1.00%   floor in the case of term loans or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.50%  ; (ii) the prime rate of Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus   1.00%  ; in each case plus an applicable margin. The base applicable margin is   3.25%   with respect to LIBOR borrowings and   2.25%   with respect to base rate borrowings under the term loan facility and base rate borrowings and swingline borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility is subject to one step down from   3.25%   to   3.00%   based on our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio, and the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to two step-downs from   3.25%   to   3.00%   and   2.75%   based on our net first lien senior secured leverage ratio. During the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , the federal funds rate ranged from   0.25%   to   0.41%  , the prime rate was   3.5%   and the one-month LIBOR ranged from   0.42%   to   0.55%  .

Senior Unsecured Debt 
  Our senior unsecured debt consists of $255.0 million aggregate principal amount borrowings of 8.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  senior notes ) and maturing on February 15, 2022. The senior notes are registered under the Securities Act, do not bear legends restricting their transfer and are not entitled to registration rights under our registration rights agreement. On or after February 15, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at certain redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes (the  indenture ). Prior to February 15, 2017, we may redeem (i) up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a price equal to 108% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) some or all of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable  make-whole  premium set forth in the indenture. 
  Capital Expenditures  
  We intend to continue to focus our future capital expenditures on reinvestment into our existing Company-owned Chuck E. Cheese s and PPP stores through various planned capital initiatives, and the development or acquisition of additional Company-owned stores. During the   first nine months of 2016  , we completed   227   game enhancements and   four   major remodels, and we opened   two   new domestic Company-owned Chuck E. Cheese s stores and   two   new domestic Company-owned PPP stores. We have funded and continue to fund our capital expenditures through existing cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures in the   first nine months of 2016   totaled approximately   $75.3 million  . 
  The following table reconciles the approximate total capital spend by initiative to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:   

  __________________ 
           (1) 
    Growth capital spend includes major remodels, store expansions, our PlayPass initiative and new store development, including relocations and franchise acquisitions. 
     (2)    Maintenance capital spend includes game enhancements, general store capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures. 
  We currently estimate our capital expenditures in   2016   will total approximately   $100 million   to   $107 million  . These capital expenditures consist of the following: (i) approximately   $32 million   to   $34 million   for maintenance capital which includes game enhancements and general store maintenance capital expenditures; (ii) approximately   $10 million   for investments in one-time information technology initiatives, (iii) approximately   $30 million   to   $33 million   for various growth initiatives, including new store openings and major remodels, and (iv) approximately   $28 million   to   $30 million   related to our PlayPass initiative. In addition, we are re-evaluating our store design for Chuck E. Cheese s stores as part of an effort to launch a new store prototype. We expect to fund our capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and existing cash on hand. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements as described in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Adjusted EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture and/or the Secured Credit Facilities. 
  We have provided Adjusted EBITDA in this report because we believe it provides investors with additional information to measure our performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance and understanding certain significant items. 
  Adjusted EBITDA is also an important measure because, under our debt agreements, our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, make certain types of acquisitions or investments, operate our business and make dividends, conduct asset sales or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, all of which will impact our financial performance, is impacted by our Adjusted EBITDA, as our lenders measure our performance with a senior secured leverage ratio by comparing our senior secured bank indebtedness to our Adjusted EBITDA, and several of the debt, investment and restricted payment baskets contained in our debt agreements are measured using Adjusted EBITDA. 
  Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA varies from others in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance, or cash flows as measures of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: 
               
    excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 
                  
    does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; 
                  
    does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
                  
    does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
                  
    does not include one-time expenditures; 
                  
    excludes the impairment of Company-owned stores or impairments of long-lived assets, and gains or losses upon disposal of property or equipment, and inventory obsolescence charges outside of the ordinary course of business; 
                  
    excludes non-cash equity based compensation expense; 
                  
    reflects the removal of the non-cash portion of rent expense relating to the impact of straight-line rent and the amortization of cash incentives and allowances received from landlords, plus the actual cash received from landlords  incentives and allowances in the period; 
                  
    reflects franchise fees received on a cash basis post-acquisition; 
                  
    excludes the purchase accounting impact to unearned revenue at the time of the acquisition; 
                  
    excludes start-up and marketing costs incurred prior to the opening of new Company-owned stores; 
     
   38 

     Table of Contents  

excludes non-recurring income and expenses primarily related to (i) non-recurring franchise fee income; (ii) severance costs; (iii) integration costs in connection with acquisitions; (iv) employee and other legal claims and settlements; (v) costs incurred in connection with the relocation of our corporate offices; (vi) actual cash landlord incentives received on our new corporate offices; (vii) sales and use tax refunds relating to prior periods; (viii) miscellaneous professional fees; and (ix) certain insurance recoveries relating to prior year expense; and 
                  
    includes estimated cost savings, including some adjustments not permitted under Article 11 of Regulation S-X. 
     Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-cash, non-recurring and other charges or costs that are deducted in calculating Net income. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certain of these expenses can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. Because of these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP results and use Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rates, commodity price changes and foreign currency fluctuation. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in the variable interest rates related to borrowings from our Secured Credit Facilities. All of our borrowings outstanding under the Secured Credit Facilities as of   October 2, 2016   of   $741.0 million   accrue interest at variable rates. Assuming the revolving credit facility remains undrawn, each 1% change in assumed interest rates, excluding the impact of our 1% interest rate floor, would result in a   $7.4 million   change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Secured Credit Facilities. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to commodity price changes related to certain food products that we purchase, primarily related to the prices of cheese and dough, which can vary throughout the year due to changes in supply, demand, and other factors. We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility associated with such commodity prices; however, we typically enter into short-term purchasing contracts, which may contain pricing arrangements designed to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations, and derivative instruments such as futures contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. For the   three months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the average cost of a block of cheese was   $1.68   and   $1.82  , respectively. The estimated increase in our food costs from a hypothetical 10% increase in the average cost of a block of cheese would have been   $0.3 million   for both the   three months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. For the   three months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the average cost of dough per pound was   $0.45   and   $0.46  , respectively. The estimated increase in our food costs from a hypothetical 10% increase in the average cost of dough per pound would have been   $0.1 million   for both the   three months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. For both the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the average cost of a block of cheese was   $1.73  . The estimated increase in our food costs from a hypothetical 10% increase in the average cost of a block of cheese would have been   $1.0 million   for both the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the average cost of dough per pound was   $0.45   and   $0.48  , respectively. The estimated increase in our food costs from a hypothetical 10% increase in the average cost of dough per pound would have been   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk associated with changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar as we operate a total of   12   Company-owned stores in Canada. For the the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2016   our Canadian stores generated operating income of   $0.1 million   and an operating loss of   $0.4 million  , respectively, compared to our consolidated operating   income   of   $12.5 million   and   $62.5 million  , respectively.  
  Changes in the currency exchange rate result in cumulative translation adjustments and are included in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and potentially result in transaction gains or losses, which are included in our earnings. The low and high currency exchange rates for a Canadian dollar into a United States dollar for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016   were   $0.685   and   $0.798  , respectively. A hypothetical 10% devaluation in the average quoted U.S. dollar-equivalent of the Canadian dollar exchange rate during both the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2016   would have decreased our reported consolidated operating results by   less than $0.1 million  .

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 2, 2016   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  During the quarterly period covered by this report there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
