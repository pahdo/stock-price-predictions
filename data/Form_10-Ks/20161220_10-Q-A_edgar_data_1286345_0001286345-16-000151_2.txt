Explanatory Note   

HPIL
Holding (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-Q/A (the  Second
Amendment ) to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June
30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) on
August 31, 2016 (the  Original Filing ), as previously amended by Amendment No.
1 on Form 10-Q/A as filed with the Commission on October 5, 2016 (the  First
Amendment ), for the purpose of revising the cover page.  

The
Original Filing and First Amendment indicated that the Company is a voluntary
filer and has never been required to file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  This
was based on the Company s lack of confirmation that a registration statement
filed by the Company under prior management had become effective.  Current
management was unable to confirm with the Company s prior management that it
had received an effective statement from the Commission with respect to the
registration statement.  Additionally, no electronic notice of effectiveness
was ever made available on the Commission s EDGAR system, so confirmation was
not readily ascertainable by review of the Company s filings on EDGAR.  Since
the Original Filing and First Amendment, the Company has discussed the status
of the subject registration statement with the Commission.  In those
discussions, the Commission telephonically confirmed that the subject
registration statement was declared effective.  Therefore, the Company wishes
to clarify that it is required to file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act and is not operating as a voluntary filer and withdraws any
statement to the contrary.  

Based
on our misunderstanding, the Company filed several periodic reports with OTC
Markets, Inc. ( OTC ) in compliance with the OTC Pink Current Information Tier
Basic Disclosure Guidelines, instead of filing those periodic reports with the
Commission.  Since that time, we have filed with the Commission all required
reports and, as of the date of this Second Amendment, are current with our
reporting obligations under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  

Except as stated in this
Explanatory Note, no other information contained in any Item of the Original
Filing or First Amendment is being amended, updated or otherwise revised. 
This Second Amendment speaks as of the filing date of the Original Filing and,
except for the filing of the First Amendment, does not reflect any events that
may have occurred subsequent to such date.  

SIGNATURES   

Pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has
duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto
duly authorized.
