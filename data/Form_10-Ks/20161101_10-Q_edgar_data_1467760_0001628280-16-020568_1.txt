  Note 1   Organization 
  Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is referred to throughout this report as the  Company,   ARI,   we,   us  and  our ) is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The Company primarily originates, acquires, invests in and manages performing commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate financings, commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. These asset classes are referred to as the Company s target assets.  
   
  Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company s accounts and those of its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany amounts have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company s most significant estimates include the fair value of financial instruments and loan loss reserve. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included.  The Company's results of operations for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. 
  On August 31, 2016, the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 26, 2016 (as amended, the  Merger Agreement ) acquired Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( AMTG ). AMTG merged with and into the Company ( Merger ) with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. As a result, all operations of AMTG and its former subsidiaries are consolidated with the operations of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, substantially all of the assets acquired from AMTG had been sold. 
  Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") ASC Topic 805, "Business Combinations", or ASC 805, the acquirer in a business combination must recognize, with certain exceptions, the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. We applied the provisions of ASC 805 in accounting for our acquisition of AMTG. In doing so, we recorded provisional amounts for certain items as of the date of the acquisition, including the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. During the measurement period, a period which shall not exceed one year, we retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of such date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized. See further discussion in Note 19 "Business Combination". 
  The Company currently operates in   one   business segment. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which broadly amends the accounting guidance for revenue recognition. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this accounting guidance will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new guidance requires that management evaluate each annual and interim reporting period whether conditions exist that give rise to substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date, and if so, provide related disclosures. Disclosures are only required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt, whether or  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

not the substantial doubt is alleviated by management s plans. No disclosures are required specific to going concern uncertainties if an assessment of the conditions does not give rise to substantial doubt. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that a company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the financial statement issuance date. If substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of the consideration of management s plans, a company should disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes): (1) principal conditions that initially give rise to substantial doubt, (2) management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions in relation to the company s ability to meet its obligations, and (3) management s plans that alleviated substantial doubt. If substantial doubt is not alleviated after considering management s plans, disclosures should enable investors to understand the underlying conditions, and include the following: (1) a statement indicating that there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date, (2) the principal conditions that give rise to substantial doubt, (3) management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions in relation to the company s ability to meet its obligations, and (4) management's plans that are intended to mitigate the adverse conditions. The new guidance applies to all companies. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the guidance related to accounting for the consolidation of certain legal entities. The modifications impact limited partnerships and similar legal entities, the evaluation of (i) fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest, (ii) fee arrangements, and (iii) related parties on the primary beneficiary determination. The Company adopted this guidance and determined there was  no material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by amending the accounting guidance to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The amendments are consistent with the accounting guidance related to debt discounts.  The Company adopted this guidance and applied its provisions retrospectively. This resulted in the reclassification of unamortized deferred financing costs from deferred financing costs, net to reductions in borrowings under repurchase agreements of   $7,875   and   $7,353   for the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Other than this reclassification, the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on  the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718),  or ASU 2016-09. ASU 2016-09 requires all income tax effects of share-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes than is permitted under current guidance without triggering liability accounting. Finally, the guidance allows a policy election to account for employee forfeitures as they occur. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this accounting guidance will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326),  or ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  The guidance  will replace the  incurred loss  approach under existing guidance with an  expected loss  model for instruments measured at amortized cost, and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model. It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and is to be adopted through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  or ASU 2016-15. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance addresses the classification of various transactions including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investments, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and others. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted.

Note 3   Fair Value Disclosure 
  GAAP establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable inputs utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair values. Market based or observable inputs are the preferred source of values, followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs. The three levels of the hierarchy are described below: 
  Level I   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level II   Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk and others. 
  Level III   Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period), unobservable inputs may be used. 
  While the Company anticipates that its valuation methods will be appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The Company will use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which may include periods of market dislocation, during which price transparency may be reduced. 
  The estimated fair value of the CMBS portfolio is determined by reference to market prices provided by certain dealers who make a market in these financial instruments. The Company believes that these dealers who are usually market makers in these securities utilize various valuation techniques and inputs including, but not limited to, observable trades, discounted cash flow, market yield and duration to price these securities.  Broker quotes are only indicative of fair value and may not necessarily represent what the Company would receive in an actual trade for the applicable instrument. Management performs additional analysis on prices received based on broker quotes to validate the prices and adjustments are made as deemed necessary by management to capture current market information. The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are based on observable market parameters and are classified as Level II in the fair value hierarchy.   In accordance with GAAP, the Company elects the fair value option for these securities at the date of purchase in order to allow the Company to measure these securities at fair value with the change in estimated fair value included as a component of earnings in order to reflect the performance of investment in a timely manner. 
  The estimated fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected cash flows are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The fair values of foreign exchange forwards are determined by comparing the contracted forward exchange rate to the current market exchange rate.  The current market exchange rates are determined by using market spot rates, forward rates and interest rate curves for the underlying countries.   The Company s derivative instruments are classified as Level II in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following table summarizes the levels in the fair value hierarchy into which the Company s financial instruments were categorized as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Note 4   Debt Securities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company's CMBS (Fair Value Option) were pledged to secure borrowings under the Company s master repurchase agreements with UBS AG, London Branch ("UBS") (the "UBS Facility") and Deutsche Bank AG ("DB") (the "DB Facility").  See "Note 8 - Borrowings Under Repurchase Agreements" for further information regarding these facilities.

CMBS (Held-to-Maturity) represents a loan the Company closed during May 2014 that was subsequently contributed to a securitization during August 2014.  During May 2014, the Company closed a   $155,000   floating-rate whole loan secured by the first mortgage and equity interests in an entity that owns a resort hotel in Aruba.  The property consists of   442   hotels rooms,   114   timeshare units,   two   casinos and approximately   131,500   square feet of retail space.  During June 2014, the Company syndicated a   $90,000   senior participation in the loan and retained a   $65,000   junior participation.  The Company evaluated this transaction and concluded due to its continuing involvement the transaction should not be accounted for as a sale.  During August 2014, both the   $90,000   senior participation and the Company's   $65,000   junior participation were contributed to a CMBS securitization.  In exchange for contributing its   $65,000   junior participation, the Company received a CMBS secured solely by the   $65,000   junior participation.  The whole loan has a   three  -year term with   two     one  -year extension options and an appraised loan-to-value ("LTV") of approximately   60%  .  
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company s debt securities at   September 30, 2016   are summarized as follows: 

During August 2016, the Company sold CMBS with an amortized cost of   $86,676   resulting in a net realized loss of   $225  , which was comprised of realized gains of   $90   and realized losses of   $315  . The sale generated proceeds of $16,222 after the repayment of   $70,229   of borrowings under the Company's master repurchase agreement with Deutsche Bank AG ("DB") (the "DB Facility"). 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company s debt securities at   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows: 

During February 2015, the Company sold CMBS with an amortized cost of   $24,038   resulting in a net realized loss of   $443  , which was comprised of realized gains of   $43   and realized losses of   $486  .  As a result of the sale,   $678   was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The sale generated proceeds of   $1,341   after the repayment of   $22,254   of borrowings under the Company's master repurchase agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo") (the "Wells Facility"). 
  The overall statistics for the Company s CMBS (Fair Value Option) investments calculated on a weighted average basis assuming no early prepayments or defaults as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows:

  The Company evaluates its loans for possible impairment on a quarterly basis. The Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor on a loan by loan basis. Specifically, a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the property s liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment,

real estate sector and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such loan loss analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as debt service coverage ratio, property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower s exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants. An allowance for loan loss is established when it is deemed probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan.

  Note 7   Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  In September 2014, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired a   59%   ownership interest in Champ Limited Partnership ( Champ LP ) following which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Champ LP then acquired a   35%   ownership interest in Bremer Kreditbank AG ("BKB").  The Company acquired its ownership interest in Champ LP for an initial purchase price paid at closing of approximately    30,724   (or   $39,477  ). The Company committed to invest up to approximately    38,000   (or   $50,000  ).  The Company together with certain other affiliated investors and unaffiliated third party investors, in aggregate, own   100%   of Champ LP.  Champ LP together with certain unaffiliated third party investors, in aggregate, own   100%   of BKB. 
  BKB specializes in corporate banking and financial services for medium-sized German companies. It also provides professional real estate financing, acquisition finance, institutional asset management and private wealth management services for German high-net-worth individuals.  
  In January 2015, the Company funded an additional investment of    3,331   (or   $3,929  ) related to its investment in Champ LP.  In February 2015, the Company sold approximately   48%   of its ownership interest in Champ LP at cost to an investment fund managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, "Apollo") for    16,314   (or   $20,794  ) (of which   $2,614   related to foreign exchange losses which were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss). In June 2016, the Company transferred    427   of its unfunded commitment to Apollo.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s unfunded commitment to Champ LP was    2,802   (or   $3,149  ). Through its interest in Champ LP, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held an indirect ownership interest of approximately   9.34%   in BKB.   
  The Company determined that Champ LP met the definition of a variable interest entity ("VIE") and that it was not the primary beneficiary; therefore, the Company did not consolidate the assets and liabilities of the partnership.  Additionally, Champ LP is an Investment Company under GAAP, and is therefore reflected at fair value. Our investment in Champ LP is accounted for as an equity method investment and therefore we record our proportionate share of the net asset value.

  Note 9   Convertible Senior Notes 
  On March 17, 2014, the Company issued   $143,750   aggregate principal amount of   5.50%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "March 2019 Notes"), for which the Company received net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expense payable by the Company of approximately   $139,037  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the March 2019 Notes had a carrying value of   $141,299   and an unamortized discount of   $2,451  .   
  On August 18, 2014, the Company issued an additional   $111,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.50%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "August 2019 Notes," and together with the March 2019 Notes, the "2019 Notes"), for which the Company received net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expense payable by the Company of approximately   $109,615  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the August 2019 Notes had a carrying value of   $108,229   and an unamortized discount of   $2,771  .   
  The following table summarizes the terms of the 2019 Notes. 

(1) 
    Effective rate includes the effect of the adjustment for the conversion option (see footnote (2) below), the value of which reduced the initial liability and was recorded in additional paid-in-capital. 
              (2) 
    The Company has the option to settle any conversions in cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof.  The conversion rate represents the number of shares of common stock issuable per   $1,000   principal amount of 2019 Notes converted, as adjusted as of October 11, 2016, in accordance with the applicable supplemental indenture as a result of cash dividend payments. The if-converted value of the 2019 Notes does not exceed their principal amount at September 28, 2016 since the closing market price of the Company s common stock does not exceed the implicit conversion prices of   $17.68   at September 30, 2016 for the 2019 Notes. 
      GAAP requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. GAAP requires that the initial proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Notes be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt that could have been issued by the Company at such time. The Company measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2019 Notes as of their issuance date based on effective interest rates.  As a result, the Company attributed approximately   $11,445   of the proceeds to the equity component of the 2019 Notes, which represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the liability component of the 2019 Notes at the date of issuance. The equity component of the 2019 Notes has been reflected within additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . The resulting debt discount is being amortized over the period during which the 2019 Notes are expected to be outstanding (the maturity date) as additional non-cash interest expense. The additional non-cash interest expense attributable to each of the 2019 Notes will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the maturity date as the 2019 Notes accrete to their par value over the same period. 
   The aggregate contractual interest expense was approximately   $3,503   and   $10,508   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The aggregate contractual interest expense was approximately   $3,503   and   $10,508   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. With respect to the amortization of the discount on the liability component of the 2019 Notes as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs, the Company reported additional non-cash interest expense of approximately   $895   and   $2,654    for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. With respect to the amortization of the discount on the liability component of the 2019 Notes as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs, the Company reported additional non-cash interest expense of approximately   $867   and   $2,566   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , potential shares of common stock contingently issuable upon the conversion of the 2019 Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share of common stock because it is management's intent and the Company currently has the ability to settle the obligation in cash.

  Note 11   Participations Sold 
  Participations sold represent the interests in loans the Company originated and subsequently partially sold.

The income earned on the participation sold is recorded as interest income and an identical amount is recorded as interest expense on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.   
  During January 2015, the Company closed a    34,519   (or   $51,996  ) floating-rate mezzanine loan secured by a portfolio of   44   senior housing facilities located throughout the United Kingdom.

  During May 2014, the Company closed a   $155,000   floating-rate whole loan secured by the first mortgage and equity interests in an entity that owns a resort hotel in Aruba.  During June 2014, the Company syndicated a   $90,000   senior participation in the loan and retained a   $65,000   junior participation in the loan.  During August 2014, both the   $90,000   senior participation and the Company's   $65,000   junior participation were contributed to a CMBS securitization.  In exchange for contributing its   $65,000   junior participation, the Company received a CMBS secured solely by the   $65,000   junior participation and classified it as CMBS (Held-to-Maturity) on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  At   September 30, 2016  , the participation had a face amount of   $85,517  , a carrying amount of   $85,465   and a cash coupon of LIBOR plus   440   basis points.   
   
  Note 12   Derivative Instruments 
  The Company uses forward currency contracts to economically hedge interest and principal payments due under its loans denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 
    
  The Company has entered into a series of forward contracts to sell an amount of foreign currency (British pound ("GBP")) for an agreed upon amount of U.S. dollars at various dates through September 2017.

The Company together with certain other affiliated investors and unaffiliated third party investors, in aggregate, own   100%   of BKB. 
   
  Note 14   Share-Based Payments 
  On September 23, 2009, the Company s board of directors approved the Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc., 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the  LTIP ). The LTIP provides for grants of restricted common stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and other equity-based awards up to an aggregate of   7.5%   of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock (on a fully diluted basis). The LTIP is administered by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors (the  Compensation Committee ) and all grants under the LTIP must be approved by the Compensation Committee. 
  The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $1,828   and   $5,434   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , related to restricted stock and RSU vesting.  The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $756   and   $2,695   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , related to restricted stock and RSU vesting.

  Below is a summary of expected restricted common stock and RSU vesting dates as of   September 30, 2016  . 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of approximately   $1,402   and   $10,470  , respectively, related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and RSUs noted in the table above. 
    
  RSU Deliveries 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company delivered   215,672   shares of common stock for   359,984   vested RSUs. The Company allows holders of RSUs to settle their tax liabilities with a reduction of their share delivery from the originally granted and vested RSUs. The amount, when agreed to by the holder, results in a cash payment to the Manager related to this tax liability and a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in-capital on the condensed consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The adjustment was   $2,626   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and is

  Legal Proceedings.   From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. 
  After the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, two putative class action lawsuits challenging the proposed First Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement), captioned Aivasian v. Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-16-001532 and Wiener v. Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-16-001837, were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, (the  Court ). A putative class and derivative lawsuit was later filed in the Court captioned Crago v. Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., No. 24-C-16-002610. Following a hearing on May 6, 2016, the Court entered orders among other things, consolidating the three actions under the caption In Re Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Case No.: 24-C-16-002610. The plaintiffs have designated the Crago complaint as the operative complaint. The operative complaint includes both direct and derivative claims, names as defendants AMTG, the board of directors of AMTG (the  AMTG Board ), ARI, Merger Sub, Apollo and Athene and alleges, among other things, that the members of the AMTG Board breached their fiduciary duties to the AMTG stockholders and that the other corporate defendants aided and abetted such  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

fiduciary breaches. The operative complaint further alleges, among other things, that the proposed First Merger involves inadequate consideration, was the result of an inadequate and conflicted sales process, and includes unreasonable deal protection devices that purportedly preclude competing offers. It also alleges that the transactions with Athene are unfair and that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on April 6, 2016 contains materially misleading disclosures and omits certain material information. The operative complaint seeks, among other things, certification of the proposed class, declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, including enjoining or rescinding the First Merger, unspecified damages, and an award of other unspecified attorneys  and other fees and costs. On May 6, 2016, counsel for the plaintiffs filed with the Court a stipulation seeking the appointment of interim co-lead counsel, which stipulation was approved by the Court on June 9, 2016.  On August 18, 2016, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated action, and the plaintiffs filed an opposition brief on October 6, 2016. The Company believes that the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits. 
    
  Bremer Kreditbank AG  .  In September 2013, the Company, together with other affiliates of Apollo, reached an agreement to make an investment in an entity that agreed to acquire a minority participation in Bremer Kreditbank AG ( BKB ). The Company committed to invest up to approximately    38,000   (or   $50,000  ), representing approximately   21%   of the ownership in BKB. In September 2014, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired a   59%   ownership interest in Champ LP following which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Champ LP then acquired a   35%   ownership interest in BKB.  
  In February 2015, the Company sold approximately   48%   of its ownership interest in Champ LP at cost to an account managed by Apollo for approximately    16,314   (or   $20,794  ). In June 2016, the Company transferred    427   of its unfunded commitment to Apollo, reducing its unfunded commitment to Champ LP to    2,802   (or   $3,149  ).  Through its interest in Champ LP, the Company now holds an indirect ownership interest of approximately   9.34%   in BKB.   
  Loan Commitments.    As described in "Note 5 - Commercial Mortgage Loans" and "Note 6 - Subordinate Loans," respectively, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had $173,680 of unfunded commitments related to its commercial mortgage loan portfolio and subordinate loan portfolio. 
   
  Note 17   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company s financial instruments not carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

To determine estimated fair values of the financial instruments listed above, market rates of interest, which include credit assumptions, are used to discount contractual cash flows. The estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amount the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The Company s securities, held-to-maturity, commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate loans, borrowings under repurchase agreements, convertible senior notes and participations sold are carried at amortized cost on the condensed consolidated financial statements and are classified as Level III in the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  Note 18   Net Income per Share 
  GAAP requires use of the two-class method of computing earnings per share for all periods presented for each class of common stock and participating security as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. Under the two-class method, during periods of net income, the net income is first reduced for dividends declared on all classes of securities to arrive at undistributed earnings. During periods of net losses, the net loss is reduced for dividends declared on participating securities  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

only if the security has the right to participate in the earnings of the entity and an objectively determinable contractual obligation to share in net losses of the entity. 
  The remaining earnings are allocated to common stockholders and participating securities to the extent that each security shares in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. Each total is then divided by the applicable number of shares to arrive at basic earnings per share. For the diluted earnings, the denominator includes all outstanding shares of common stock and all potential shares of common stock assumed issued if they are dilutive. The numerator is adjusted for any changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of these potential shares of common stock. 
  The table below presents basic and diluted net (loss) income per share of common stock using the two-class method for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   , respectively,   942,062   and   952,241   unvested RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect was anti-dilutive.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively,   578,395   and   596,351   unvested RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect was anti-dilutive. 

Note 19   Business Combination 
  On August 31, 2016, the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, acquired AMTG for consideration of common stock and preferred stock, as applicable and cash. AMTG merged with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. As a result, all operations of AMTG and its former subsidiaries are consolidated with the operations of the Company. In connection with financing the Merger, on August 31, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement (the  Athene Loan Agreement ) with Athene USA Corporation, a subsidiary of Athene Holding Ltd., as lender ( Athene USA ), pursuant to which the Company borrowed   $175,000   in order to fund a portion of the Company s obligations under the Merger Agreement. The Athene Loan Agreement was repaid in full and terminated on September 1, 2016. On August 31, 2016, pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated February 26, 2016 (as amended, the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) by and among Athene Annuity   Life Assurance Company and Athene Annuity and Life Company (collectively,  Athene Annuity ) and the Company, the Company sold primarily non-agency residential mortgage backed securities previously held by AMTG to Athene Annuity for cash consideration of approximately   $1,100,000  . Proceeds from the sale were used to repay approximately   $804,000    in associated financing,   $175,000   to satisfy the Athene Loan Agreement and for general corporate purposes.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, substantially all of the assets acquired from AMTG have been sold. This Merger provided the Company with the ability to expand the balance sheet in a cost effective and accretive manner at a time when ARI s management believes there is significant opportunity to deploy capital into commercial real estate debt investments at attractive returns.

     Table of Contents  

The Merger was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805.    T  he transactions pursuant to the Athene Loan Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement were contemporaneous with and contingent on the Merger, therefore the Company recorded the transaction net. The Company was designated as the accounting acquirer. The total purchase price has been allocated based upon management s estimates of fair value. The difference between the fair value of net assets of AMTG and the consideration was recorded as a bargain purchase gain. 
  The bargain purchase gain was computed as follows:  

The Company incurred   $4,925   and   $11,350   of transaction-related expenses related to the Merger during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Transaction-related expenses are comprised primarily of transaction fees and Merger costs, including legal, finance, consulting, professional fees and other third-party costs. 
  The following table provides the pro forma consolidated operational data as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2016:  

The pro forma consolidated operational data is based on assumptions and estimates considered appropriate by our management; however, these pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been obtained had the Merger occurred at the beginning of the period presented, nor do they purport to represent the consolidated results of operations for future periods. The pro forma consolidated operational data do not include the impact of any synergies that may be achieved from the Merger or any strategies that management may consider in order to continue to efficiently manage operations.

  Investment Activity.   Subsequent to quarter end, the Company closed an   $80,000   first mortgage loan (all of which is expected to be funded by year end) secured by a to-be-developed data center in Manassas, Virginia which has been substantially pre-leased on a long-term basis to a credit tenant.  
    
  The Company closed a  $130,000   junior mezzanine loan secured by the equity interests in a portfolio of   155   healthcare properties representing   18,662   licensed beds across   20   states.  
    
  The Company closed a   $30,000   preferred equity interest for the development of a   247,130   square foot   30  -story condominium tower with ground-floor retail space on the Upper East Side of New York City.  
    
  The Company entered into a   twelve   month extension and upsized the Company s outstanding loan amount through the acquisition of an additional    45,000   (or approximately   $57,400  ) of pari passu interests in an existing pre-development mezzanine loan for the development of a luxury condominium project in Mayfair, London, bringing ARI s total outstanding loan balance to    100,000  .  
    
  During October 2016, the Company funded approximately   $6,228   related to previously closed loans and received approximately   $34,500   from loan repayments.

  Overview 
  The Company is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The Company primarily originates, acquires, invests in and manages performing commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate financings, CMBS and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. These asset classes are referred to as the Company s target assets. 
  The Company is externally managed and advised by the Manager, an indirect subsidiary of Apollo, a leading global alternative investment manager with a contrarian and value oriented investment approach in private equity, credit and real estate with assets under management of approximately $188.6 billion as of September 30, 2016. 
  The Manager is led by an experienced team of senior real estate professionals who have significant expertise in underwriting and structuring commercial real estate financing transactions. The Company benefits from Apollo s global

infrastructure and operating platform, through which the Company is able to source, evaluate and manage potential investments in the Company s target assets. 
   
  Market Overview 
  The commercial real estate lending market has recovered from the downturn experienced as part of the correction in the global financial markets which began in mid-2007.  Property values in many markets and across multiple property types have recovered and the lending market is functioning with both established and new entrants.  Based on the current market dynamics, including significant upcoming commercial real estate debt maturities, there remains a compelling opportunity for the Company to invest capital in its target assets at attractive risk adjusted returns. The Company will continue to focus on underlying real estate value, and transactions that benefit from the Company s ability to execute complex and sophisticated transactions. 
  During and immediately following the financial crisis, due to the prevalence of lenders granting extensions across the commercial mortgage loan industry, the demand for new capital to refinance maturing commercial mortgage debt was somewhat tempered.  This trend has largely abated as many borrowers refinance legacy loans and pursue new acquisitions.  
  New-issue CMBS volume continued to grow in 2015 with total issuance in the United States of approximately $101 billion, a 7% increase from the approximately $94 billion issued during the prior year.  Despite the robust issuance in 2015, current volumes of CMBS issuance are still moderate relative to the peak of the market, which saw more than $229 billion in CMBS issuance in 2007, creating significant opportunities for non-CMBS lenders such as the Company.  Furthermore, the credit risk retention rule for CMBS lenders, which is scheduled to be implemented by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on December 24, 2016, will mandate that CMBS originators retain economic interests in the commercial property loans they securitize and sell to third-party investors. While the magnitude of the impact has yet to be seen, market participants and researchers expect the risk retention rule will likely raise the cost of borrowing via CMBS loans and decrease the number of market participants, creating additional opportunities for non-bank lenders. As a likely sign of this uncertainty, 2016 year-to-date CMBS issuance has been subdued. As of the end of the third quarter, year-to-date CMBS issuance in the United States was approximately $49 billion, a significant decrease over third quarter year-to-date CMBS issuance in the United States of approximately $81 billion in 2015.  
  While an active CMBS market can be viewed as an indicator of the active commercial real estate lending markets, we do not participate in the conduit lending market, and therefore the volatility in the CMBS market has minimal impact on our core lending business.  We believe the challenges faced by conduit lenders and the general uncertainty around value and pricing could create attractive risk adjusted investment opportunities for the Company.  As a result, we expect to continue to see opportunities to originate mezzanine and first mortgage financings in transactions which benefit from the Company s ability to source, structure and execute complex transactions. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  A summary of the Company s accounting policies is set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   under  Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates.

  Investments 
  The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company s investments at   September 30, 2016  :

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    CMBS includes   $62,324   of restricted cash related to the UBS Facility and the DB Facility. 
              (2)  
    Remaining Weighted Average Life assumes all extension options are exercised. 
              (3) 
    Internal rate of return ("IRR") is the annualized effective compounded return rate that accounts for the time-value of money and represents the rate of return on an investment over a holding period expressed as a percentage of the investment. It is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash outflows (the costs of investment) equal to the net present value of cash inflows (returns on investment). It is derived from the negative and positive cash flows resulting from or produced by each transaction (or for a transaction involving more than one investment, cash flows resulting from or produced by each of the investments), whether positive, such as investment returns, or negative, such as transaction expenses or other costs of investment, taking into account the dates on which such cash flows occurred or are expected to occur, and compounding interest accordingly.  The underwritten IRR for the investments shown in the above table reflect the returns underwritten by the Manager, taking into account leverage and calculated on a weighted average basis assuming no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults but assuming that extension options are exercised and that the cost of borrowings remains constant over the remaining term.  With respect to certain loans, the underwritten IRR calculation assumes certain estimates with respect to the timing and magnitude of future fundings for the remaining commitments and associated loan repayments, and assumes no defaults. IRR is the annualized effective compounded return rate that accounts for the time-value of money and represents the rate of return on an investment over a holding period expressed as a percentage of the investment. It is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash outflows (the costs of investment) equal to the net present value of cash inflows (returns on investment). It is derived from the negative and positive cash flows resulting from or produced by each transaction (or for a transaction involving more than one investment, cash flows resulting from or produced by each of the investments), whether positive, such as investment returns, or negative, such as transaction expenses or other costs of investment, taking into account the dates on which such cash flows occurred or are expected to occur, and compounding interest accordingly. There can be no assurance that the actual IRRs will equal the underwritten IRRs shown in the table. See  Item 1A-Risk Factors-The Company may not achieve its underwritten internal rate of return on its investments which may lead to future returns that may be significantly lower than anticipated  included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of some of the factors that could adversely impact the returns received by the Company from the investments shown in the table or elsewhere in this quarterly report over time.

    Represents an underwritten levered weighted average IRR.  The Company's ability to achieve the underwritten levered weighted average IRR additionally depends upon the availability of the JPMorgan Facility or any replacement facility with similar terms with regard to its portfolio of first mortgage loans.   Without such availability, the levered weighted average underwritten IRR will be lower than the amount shown above.

    IRR calculated from date of investment in 2015 through September 30, 2016 and includes the historical and projected cash flows for the CMBS held.   
              (6) 
    Subordinate loans are net of a participation sold during February 2015.  The Company presents the participation sold as both assets and non-recourse liabilities because the participation does not qualify as a sale according to GAAP.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had one such participation sold with a carrying amount of    19,626   (or   $25,459  ).   
              (7) 
    Subordinate loans also include CMBS (Held-to-Maturity) are net of a participation sold during June 2014.  The Company presents the participation sold as both assets and non-recourse liabilities because the participation does not qualify as a sale according to GAAP.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had one such participation sold with a carrying amount of   $85,465  .

  Investment Activity 
   In January 2016, the Company closed a $220,000 first mortgage loan, $177,500 of which was funded, secured by  16 existing retail and office properties for redevelopment located in the Design District neighborhood of Miami, Florida. A portion of the first funding of the loan was used to refinance a $33,000 first mortgage loan the Company originated to the borrower in June 2015, and for the acquisition of two additional parcels. The floating-rate loan has a two-year initial term with a one-year extension option followed by a six-month extension option. The first mortgage loan has a loan-to-cost of 65% and has been underwritten to generate a levered IRR of approximately 15%. 
  In February 2016, the Company closed a $77,000 mezzanine loan, $21,888 of which was funded at closing, for the redevelopment and conversion of an existing commercial property into 139 luxury condominiums located in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. The floating-rate loan has a 42-month initial term with a one-year extension option followed by a six-month extension option and is part of a $411,000 financing consisting of a $334,000 first mortgage loan and the Company s $77,000 mezzanine loan. The mezzanine loan has an appraised loan-to-net sellout of 57% and has been underwritten to generate an IRR of approximately 14%. 
  In March 2016, the Company closed a $31,000  first mortgage loan, $28,500 of which was funded at closing, for the predevelopment of an existing office property located in the South End neighborhood of Boston.

  Other Potential Sources of Financing 
  The Company s primary sources of cash currently consist of cash available, which was   $254,643   as of   September 30, 2016  , principal and interest payments the Company receives on its portfolio of assets, and available borrowings under its repurchase agreements. The Company expects its other sources of cash to consist of cash generated from operations and the possible prepayments of principal received on the Company s portfolio of assets. Such prepayments are difficult to estimate.  At   September 30, 2016  , subject to certain conditions, the Company had $294,914 in unused capacity under its JP Morgan Facility.  Depending on market conditions, the Company may utilize additional borrowings as a source of cash, which may also include additional repurchase agreements as well as other borrowings such as credit facilities, or conduct additional securities offerings. 
  The Company maintains policies relating to its borrowings and use of leverage. See   Leverage Policies  below. In the future, the Company may seek to raise further equity or debt capital or engage in other forms of borrowings in order to fund future investments or to refinance expiring indebtedness. 
  The Company generally intends to hold its target assets as long-term investments, although it may sell certain of its investments in order to manage its interest rate risk and liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. 
  To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company must distribute annually at least 90% of its taxable income. These distribution requirements limit the Company s ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. 
   
  Leverage Policies 
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

The Company uses leverage for the sole purpose of financing its portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. In addition to its repurchase agreements, in the future the Company may access additional sources of borrowings. The Company s charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness the Company can incur; however, the Company is limited by certain financial covenants under its repurchase agreements. Consistent with the Company s strategy of keeping leverage within a conservative range, the Company expects that its total borrowings on loans will be in an amount that is approximately 35% of the value of its total loan portfolio. 
   
  Investment Guidelines 
  The Company's current investment guidelines, approved by the Company's board of directors, are comprised of the following: 
             
    no investment will be made that would cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 
                
    no investment will be made that would cause the Company to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; 
                
    investments will be predominantly in the Company s target assets; 
                
    no more than 20% of the Company s cash equity (on a consolidated basis) will be invested in any single investment at the time of the investment; 
                
    until appropriate investments can be identified, the Manager may invest the proceeds of any offering in interest bearing, short-term investments, including money market accounts and/or funds, that are consistent with the Company s intention to qualify as a REIT. 
      
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  The Company s contractual obligations including expected interest payments as of   September 30, 2016   are summarized as follows: 

* 
    Assumes current LIBOR of   0.53%   for interest payments due under the JPMorgan Facility and the Goldman Loan.  
     **        Assumes extension options are exercised.

  In February 2015, the Company sold approximately   48%   of its ownership interest in Champ LP at cost to an account managed by Apollo for approximately  16,314 (or   $20,794  ), reducing its then unfunded commitment to Champ LP to  3,229 (or $3,675).  In June 2016, the Company transferred  427 of its unfunded commitment to Apollo. reducing its unfunded commitment to Champ LP to    2,802   (or   $3,149  ). Through its interest in Champ LP, the Company now holds an indirect ownership interest of approximately   9.34%   in BKB.

Loan Commitments.    At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $173,680   of unfunded commitments related to its commercial mortgage loan portfolio and subordinate loan portfolio.  
  Management Agreement.    On September 23, 2009, the Company entered into the Management Agreement with the Manager pursuant to which the Manager is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses. The table above does not include amounts due under the Management Agreement as those obligations do not have fixed and determinable payments.  Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager is entitled to a base management fee calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 1.5% of the Company s stockholders  equity (as defined in the Management Agreement), per annum. The Manager will use the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and personnel. The Company does not reimburse its Manager or its affiliates for the salaries and other compensation of their personnel, except for the allocable share of the compensation of (1) the Company s Chief Financial Officer based on the percentage of time spent on the Company s affairs and (2) other corporate finance, tax, accounting, internal audit, legal, risk management, operations, compliance and other non-investment professional personnel of the Manager or its affiliates who spend all or a portion of their time managing the Company s affairs based on the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to the Company s affairs. The Company is also required to reimburse its Manager for operating expenses related to the Company incurred by its Manager, including expenses relating to legal, accounting, due diligence and other services. Expense reimbursements to the Manager are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month. The Company s reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation. 
  The current term of the Management Agreement currently runs through September 29, 2017. Absent certain action by the independent directors of the Company s board of directors, as described below, the Management Agreement will automatically renew on each anniversary for a one year term. The Management Agreement may be terminated upon expiration of the one-year term only upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company s independent directors, based upon (1) unsatisfactory performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to the Company or (2) a determination that the management fee payable to the Manager is not fair, subject to the Manager s right to prevent such a termination based on unfair fees by accepting a mutually acceptable reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of the Company s independent directors. The Manager must be provided with written notice of any such termination at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the then existing term and will be paid a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination. Amounts payable under the Company s Management Agreement are not fixed and determinable. Following a meeting by the Company s independent directors in February 2016, which included a discussion of the Manager s performance and the level of the management fees thereunder, the Company determined not to terminate the Management Agreement. 
   
  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Except as disclosed in "Note 7 - Unconsolidated Joint Venture," the Company does not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, the Company has not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment to provide additional funding to any such entities. 
   
  Dividends 
  The Company intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of its common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. The Company generally intends over time to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to its net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by its board of directors. Any distributions the Company makes will be at the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, its actual results of operations. These results and the Company s ability to pay distributions will be affected by various factors, including the net interest and other income from its portfolio, its operating expenses and any other expenditures. If the Company s cash available for distribution is less than its net taxable income, the Company could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or the Company may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 
  The Company has 3,450,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, which entitles holders to receive dividends at the rate of 8.625% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference equivalent to $2.16 per annum, per share. The dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears. Except under certain limited circumstances, the Series A Preferred Stock is generally not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or any  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

other securities of the Company at the election of the holders. After August 1, 2017, the Company may, at its option, redeem the shares at a redemption price of $25.00, plus any accrued unpaid distribution through the date of the redemption. 
  The Company has 8,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, which entitles holders to receive dividends that are payable quarterly in arrears.  The Series B Preferred Stock will pay cumulative cash dividends: (i) from, and including, the original date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock to, but excluding, September 20, 2020, at an initial rate of 8.00% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference; and (ii) from, and including, September 20, 2020, at the rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) 8.00% and (b) a floating rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR rate as calculated on each applicable date of determination plus 6.46% of the $25.00 liquidation preference.  Except under certain limited circumstances, the Series B Preferred Stock is generally not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or any other securities of the Company at the election of the holders. On or after September 21, 2020, the Company may, at its option, redeem the shares at a redemption price of $25.00, plus any accrued unpaid distribution through the date of the redemption. 
  The Company has 6,900,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding, which entitles holders to receive dividends that are payable quarterly in arrears. The Series C Preferred Stock will pay cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.00% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.00 per annum per share) from, and including July 29, 2016 (the  Series C Initial Dividend Date ) and shall be payable (i) for the period from the Series C Initial Dividend Date to, but excluding, October 31, 2016, on October 31, 2016, and (ii) for each subsequent quarterly dividend period commencing on the last day of each of January, April, July and October and ending on, and including, the day before the first day of the next succeeding dividend period, quarterly in equal amounts in arrears on the last day of each April, July, October and January, commencing on January 31, 2017 at the then applicable annual rate. Except under certain limited circumstances, the Series C Preferred Stock is generally not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or any other securities of the Company at the election of the holders. On or after September 20, 2017, the Company may, at its option, redeem the shares at a redemption price of $25.00, plus any accrued unpaid distribution through the date of the redemption. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Operating Earnings 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company s Operating Earnings were $32,744, or $0.45 per share, and   $96,002  , or   $1.38   per share.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company s Operating Earnings were $31,742, or $0.53 per share, and   $80,347  , or   $1.42   per share.  Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined by the Company as net income available to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for (i) equity-based compensation expense (a portion of which may become cash-based upon final vesting and settlement of awards should the holder elect net share settlement to satisfy income tax withholding), (ii) any unrealized gains or losses or other non-cash items included in net income available to common stockholders, (iii) unrealized income from unconsolidated joint ventures, (iv) foreign currency gains (losses) other than realized gains/(losses) related to interest income, (v) the non-cash amortization expense related to the reclassification of a portion of the convertible senior notes to stockholders  equity in accordance with GAAP, and (vi) provision for loan losses. 
  In order to evaluate the effective yield of the portfolio, the Company uses Operating Earnings to reflect the net investment income of the Company s portfolio as adjusted to include the net interest expense related to the Company s derivative instruments. Operating Earnings allows the Company to isolate the net interest expense associated with the Company s swaps in order to monitor and project the Company s full cost of borrowings. The Company also believes that its investors use Operating Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers and, as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Operating Earnings is useful to its investors. 
  A significant limitation associated with Operating Earnings as a measure of the Company s financial performance over any period is that it excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from investments. In addition, the Company s presentation of Operating Earnings may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. As a result, Operating Earnings should not be considered as a substitute for the Company s GAAP net income as a measure of its financial performance or any measure of its liquidity under GAAP. 
  Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company has slightly modified its definition of Operating Earnings to include realized gains/(losses) on currency swaps related to interest income on investments denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars.  The Company believes that including the effects of realized gains/(losses) on currency swaps related to interest income more accurately reflects the Company's investment income for a particular period and will allow investors to more easily compare its operating results over various periods.  The effects of such unrealized gains/(losses) in prior periods were not material to the Company's financial results.  The Company intends to apply this modified definition for Operating Earnings for all future periods.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  The Company seeks to manage its risks related to the credit quality of its assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value, while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of its capital stock. While risks are inherent in any business enterprise, the Company seeks to quantify and justify risks in light of available returns and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks the Company undertakes. 
  Credit Risk 
  One of the Company s strategic focuses is acquiring assets that it believes to be of high credit quality. The Company believes this strategy will generally keep its credit losses and financing costs low. However, the Company is subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with its other target assets. The Company seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, and by deploying a value-driven approach to underwriting and diligence, consistent with the Manager s historical investment strategy, with a focus on current cash flows and potential risks to cash flow. The Company enhances its due diligence and underwriting efforts by accessing the Manager s knowledge base and industry contacts. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact the Company s operating results. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond the Company s control. The Company is subject to interest rate risk in connection with its target assets and its related financing obligations. 
  To the extent consistent with maintaining the Company s REIT qualification, the Company seeks to manage risk exposure to protect its portfolio of financial assets against the effects of major interest rate changes. The Company generally seeks to manage this risk by: 
             
    attempting to structure its financing agreements to have a range of different maturities, terms, amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods; 
                
    using hedging instruments, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps; and 
                
    to the extent available, using securitization financing to better match the maturity of the Company s financing with the duration of its assets. 
     At   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company s borrowings outstanding under the Goldman Loan, the JPM Facility and participations sold were floating-rate borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had floating rate assets with a face amount of $2,184,182 resulting in net variable rate exposure of $776,399.  A 50 basis point increase in LIBOR would increase the quarterly net interest income related to this variable rate exposure by approximately $1,492.  Any such hypothetical impact on interest rates on the Company s variable rate borrowings does not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in a rising interest rate environment.  Further, in the event of a change in interest rates of that magnitude, the Company may take actions to further mitigate the Company s exposure to such a change.  However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company s financial structure. 
  Prepayment Risk 
  Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the return on an asset to be less than expected. The Company does not anticipate facing prepayment risk on most of its portfolio of assets since the Company anticipates that most of the commercial loans held directly by the Company or securing the Company s CMBS assets will contain provisions preventing prepayment or imposing prepayment penalties in the event of loan prepayments. 
  Market Risk 
  Market value risk.   The Company s available-for-sale securities and securities at estimated fair value are reflected at their estimated fair value. The change in estimated fair value of securities available-for-sale is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income while the change in estimated fair value of securities at estimated fair value is reflected as a component of net income. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease;  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of the Company s assets may be adversely impacted. 
  Real estate risk.   Commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans or loans, as the case may be, which could also cause the Company to suffer losses. 
  Inflation 
  Virtually all of the Company s assets and liabilities will be interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence the Company s performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and distributions are declared in order to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain the Company s REIT qualification. In each case, the Company s activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation. 
   
  ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
  The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to the Company that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
  During the period ended   September 30, 2016  , there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  
  After the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, two putative class action lawsuits challenging the proposed First Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement), captioned Aivasian v. Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-16-001532 and Wiener v. Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-16-001837, were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (the  Court ). A putative class and derivative lawsuit was later filed in the Court captioned Crago v. Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc., No. 24-C-16-002610. Following a hearing on May 6, 2016, the Court entered orders among other things, consolidating the three actions under the caption In Re Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Case No.: 24-C-16-002610. The plaintiffs have designated the Crago complaint as the operative complaint. The operative complaint includes both direct and derivative claims, names as defendants AMTG, the board of directors of AMTG (the  AMTG Board ), ARI, Merger Sub, Apollo and Athene and alleges, among other things, that the members of the AMTG Board breached their fiduciary duties to the AMTG stockholders and that the other corporate defendants aided and abetted such fiduciary breaches. The operative complaint further alleges, among other things, that the proposed First Merger involves inadequate consideration, was the result of an inadequate and conflicted sales process, and includes unreasonable deal protection devices that purportedly preclude competing offers. It also alleges that the transactions with Athene are unfair and that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on April 6, 2016 contains materially misleading disclosures and omits certain material information. The operative complaint seeks, among other things, certification of the proposed class, declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, including enjoining or rescinding the First Merger, unspecified damages, and an award of other unspecified attorneys  and other fees and costs. On May 6, 2016, counsel for the plaintiffs filed with the Court a stipulation seeking the appointment of interim co-lead counsel, which stipulation was approved by the Court on June 9, 2016.  On August 18, 2016, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated action, and the plaintiffs filed an opposition brief on October 6, 2016. The defendants believe that the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits. 
  On May 13, 2016, AMTG and ARM Manager, LLC, AMTG s manager prior to the Merger, each received a subpoena from the New York Department of Financial Services, requesting that they provide certain specified documents related to an investigation and inquiry being undertaken by the New York Department of Financial Services relating to seller-financed real estate contracts. According to published news reports, this subpoena is part of a broader inquiry by the New York Department of Financial Services into the seller-financed home sale industry and a number of other investment firms were reported to have received similar inquiries. As AMTG s successor in the Merger, the Company intends to cooperate fully with the subpoenas. The Company believes that AMTG s seller finance program was operated in compliance with law.
