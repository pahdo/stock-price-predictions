EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  This Report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of UDR, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, of which UDR, Inc. is the parent company and sole general partner. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to  we,   us,   our,  the  Company,   UDR  or  UDR, Inc.  refer collectively to UDR, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, including United Dominion Realty, L.P. and UDR Lighthouse DownREIT L.P. (the  DownREIT Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership of which UDR is the sole general partner. The DownREIT Partnership was formed in conjunction with certain acquisitions from Home Properties, L.P., a New York limited partnership, by UDR in October 2015. Unless the context otherwise requires, the references in this Report to the  Operating Partnership  or the  OP  refer to United Dominion Realty, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  Common stock  refers to the common stock of UDR and  stockholders  means the holders of shares of UDR s common stock and preferred stock. The limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership are referred to as the  OP Units  and  DownREIT Units,  and the holders of the OP Units and DownREIT Units are referred to as  unitholders.  This combined Form 10-Q is being filed separately by UDR and the Operating Partnership. 
  There are a number of differences between our Company and our Operating Partnership, which are reflected in our disclosure in this Report. UDR is a real estate investment trust (a  REIT ), whose most significant asset is its ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. UDR also conducts business through other subsidiaries, including its taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ). UDR acts as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, holds interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, owns and operates properties, issues securities from time to time and guarantees debt of certain of our subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of a substantial portion of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity securities. The Operating Partnership has guaranteed certain outstanding debt of UDR. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , UDR owned   110,883   units (100%) of the general partnership interests of the Operating Partnership and   174,116,596   units (approximately   95.1%  ) of the limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. UDR conducts a substantial amount of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through the Operating Partnership, and, by virtue of its ownership of the OP Units and being the Operating Partnership s sole general partner, UDR has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. Separate financial statements and accompanying notes, as well as separate discussions under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  are provided for each of UDR and the Operating Partnership.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Basis of Presentation 
  UDR, Inc., collectively with our consolidated subsidiaries ( UDR,  the  Company,   we,   our,  or  us ), is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment communities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UDR and its subsidiaries, including United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership  or the  OP ) and UDR Lighthouse DownREIT L.P. (the  DownREIT Partnership ). As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   183,278,698   units in the Operating Partnership outstanding, of which   174,227,479   units, or   95.1%  , were owned by UDR and   9,051,219   units, or   4.9%  , were owned by limited partners. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   32,367,380   units in the DownREIT Partnership ( DownREIT Units ) outstanding, of which   16,390,657  , or   50.6%  , were owned by UDR (of which,   13,470,651  , or   41.6%  , were held by the Operating Partnership) and   15,976,723  , or   49.4%  , were owned by outside limited partners. The consolidated financial statements of UDR include the noncontrolling interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership.  
  The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted according to such rules and regulations, although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and eliminations necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been included. Such adjustments are normal and recurring in nature. The interim results presented are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for a full year. The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   appearing in UDR s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   February 23, 2016  . 
  The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date its financial statements were issued. No significant recognized or non-recognized subsequent events were noted other than those in Note 3,   Real Estate Owned  , and Note 5,   Joint Ventures and Partnerships  . 
   
  2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The ASU addresses specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice, including the treatment of distributions received from equity method investees. The updated standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented; early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The standard requires entities to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss for most financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, and to present the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The updated standard will be effective for the

     Table of Contents  
  UDR, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

Company on January 1, 2020; early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The ASU aims to simplify the accounting for share-based payments by amending the accounting for forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification in the statements of cash flow and income taxes. The updated standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The update requires a prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective approach, depending on the type of amendment. The Company does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The standard amends the existing lease accounting guidance and requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of one year or less) on their balance sheets. Lessees will continue to recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, accounting for leases under the new guidance is substantially the same as in prior periods, but eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the treatment of initial direct costs. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparable period presented, with an option to elect certain transition relief. Full retrospective application is prohibited. The standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model of consolidation. Under ASU 2015-02, companies will need to re-evaluate whether an entity meets the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity ( VIE ) or whether the consolidation of an entity should be assessed under the voting model. The new standard specifically eliminates the presumption in the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless that presumption can be overcome. The new standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard did not result in the consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or the deconsolidation of any entities previously consolidated. Upon adopting the new standard, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership became VIEs as the limited partners of these entities lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company is the primary beneficiary of, and continues to consolidate, the entities determined to be VIEs.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard specifically excludes lease contracts. The ASU allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method, and the standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018; early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2017. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Company accounts for subsidiary partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities in which it holds an ownership interest in accordance with the amended consolidation guidance. The Company first evaluates whether each entity is a VIE. Under the VIE model, the Company consolidates an entity when it has control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, the Company consolidates an entity when it controls the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  In accordance with GAAP, a discontinued operation represents (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale in a single transaction and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity s financial results, or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition. A strategic shift could include a disposal of (1) a separate major line of business, (2) a separate major geographic area of operations, (3) a major equity method investment, or (4) other major parts of an entity.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

We record sales of real estate that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation in   Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned, net of tax     on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Revenue and Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition 
  Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents and tenants in accordance with GAAP. Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and recognized when earned. The Company recognizes interest income, management and other fees and incentives when earned, and the amounts are fixed and determinable. 
  For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit recognition, we remove the related assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an alternate method of accounting. Unless certain limited criteria are met, non-monetary transactions, including property exchanges, are accounted for at fair value. 
  Sales to entities in which we retain or otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to the outside interest of the buyer and defer the gain on the interest we retain. The Company recognizes any deferred gain when the property is sold to a third party. In transactions accounted for by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the entire property. 
  Notes Receivable 
    
  The following table summarizes our notes receivable, net as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (  dollars in thousands):   

  (a) The Company has a secured note receivable with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of   $13.0 million  . Interest payments are due monthly. The note matures at the earliest of the following: (a) the closing of any private or public capital raising in the amount of   $5.0 million   or greater; (b) an acquisition; (c) acceleration in the event of default; or (d) the eighth anniversary of the date of the note (February 2020). 
  In March 2016, the terms of this secured note receivable were amended to extend the maturity from the fifth anniversary of the date of the note (February 2017) to the eighth anniversary of the date of the note (February 2020).  
  (b) The Company has a secured note receivable with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of   $2.5 million  . Interest payments are due monthly.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

(d) In April 2016, the Company entered into a secured note receivable with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of   $15.0 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company loaned   $3.0 million  . Interest payments are due monthly. The note matures at the earliest of the following: (a) the closing of any private or public capital raising in the amount of   $25.0 million   or greater; (b) an acquisition; (c) acceleration in the event of default; or (d) the fifth anniversary of the date of the note (April 2021). 
  The Company recognized   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million   of interest income from notes receivable during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.3 million   and   $1.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   none   of which was related party interest income. Interest income is included in   Interest income and other income/(expense), net   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Comprehensive Income/(Loss) 
  Comprehensive income/(loss), which is defined as the change in equity during each period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources, including all changes in equity during a period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss). For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company s other comprehensive income/(loss) consisted of the gain/(loss) (effective portion) on derivative instruments that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges, (gain)/loss on derivative instruments reclassified from other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings, and the allocation of other comprehensive income/(loss) to noncontrolling interests. The (gain)/loss on derivative instruments reclassified from other comprehensive income/(loss) is included in   Interest expense   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10,   Derivatives and Hedging Activity,   for further discussion.  
  Income Taxes 
  Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations for the operating properties,   no   provision for federal income taxes has been provided for at UDR. Historically, the Company has generally incurred only state and local excise and franchise taxes. UDR has elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ), primarily those engaged in development activities. 
  Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date. The Company s deferred tax assets are generally the result of differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets and timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , UDR s net deferred tax asset was   $8.5 million   (net of a valuation allowance of   $0.1 million  ), which is included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  GAAP defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition. 
  The Company recognizes its tax positions and evaluates them using a two-step process. First, UDR determines whether a tax position is more likely than   not (greater than 50 percent probability)   to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.

3. REAL ESTATE OWNED 
  Real estate assets owned by the Company consist of income producing operating properties, properties under development, land held for future development, and sold or held for disposition properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned and consolidated   132   communities in   10   states plus the District of Columbia totaling   40,728   apartment homes. The following table summarizes the carrying amounts for our real estate owned (at cost) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (dollars in thousands): 

In June 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from   50%   to   100%   in a parcel of land in Los Angeles, California for a purchase price of approximately   $20.1 million  , including closing costs. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its   50%   interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 5,   Joint Ventures and Partnerships  ). We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by   $31.1 million  . Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company entered into a triple-net operating ground lease for the parcel of land at market terms with a third-party developer. The lessee plans to construct a multi-family community on the parcel of land. The ground lease provides the ground lessee with options to buy the fee interest in the parcel of land. The lease term is   49   years plus   two     25  -year extension options, does not transfer ownership to the lessee, and does not include a bargain purchase option.  
    
  In August 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from   5%   to   100%   in a parcel of land in Dublin, California for a purchase price of approximately   $8.5 million  , including closing costs. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its   5%   interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 5,   Joint Ventures and Partnerships  ). We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by   $8.9 million  .  
    
  In September 2016, the Company entered into agreements to sell   seven   operating communities with a total of   1,402   apartment homes for a sales price of approximately   $236.0 million  . The operating communities were classified as held for disposition as of September 30, 2016 and the sales are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.      
    
  On October 3, 2016, the Company increased its ownership from   50%   to   100%   in   two   operating communities located in Bellevue, Washington with a total of   331   apartment homes for a cash purchase price of approximately   $70.3 million  , including closing costs, and assumed secured debt of   $75.8 million   with a weighted average interest rate of   3.67%  . As a result, as of October 3, 2016, the Company consolidated the operating communities. As of September 30, 2016, UDR accounted for its   50%   interest as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 5,   Joint Ventures and Partnerships  ). We accounted for the consolidation as a business combination resulting in a projected gain on consolidation of approximately   $34.0 million  . Prior to September 30, 2016, as part of this acquisition, the Company funded   $69.4 million  , which is included in   Funds held in escrow from Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchanges     on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company sold a retail center in Bellevue, Washington and its   95%   ownership interest in   two   parcels of land in Santa Monica, California for total gross proceeds of   $69.4 million  , resulting in total net proceeds of   $66.1 million   and a total gain, net of tax, of   $10.4 million  . A portion of the proceeds related to the sale of the retail center in Bellevue, Washington was designated for Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 1031 exchanges. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $17.8 million   of these proceeds was included in   Funds held in escrow from Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchanges   on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  On October 11, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell an operating community with   380   apartment homes for a sales price of approximately   $48.6 million  . The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.   
    
  Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as   Total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation  . The Company capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, were   $1.0 million   and   $1.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.7 million   and   $5.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total interest capitalized was   $4.1 million   and   $3.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $12.1 million   and   $12.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life. 
   
  4. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02. See discussion in Note 2,   Significant Accounting Policies   for further details. As a result of the adoption, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership were determined to be VIEs. As the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary, we will continue to consolidate these entities. 
    
  The Company has determined that the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership are VIEs as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore continues to consolidate, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership based on its role as the manager of the communities and its direct ownership interests, including all general partner interests. The Company's role as community manager and its equity interests give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the right to receive potentially significant benefits of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership. 
    
  See the consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership presented within this Report and Note 4,   Unconsolidated Entities  , to the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements for the results of operations of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership, respectively. 
   
  5. JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS 
  UDR has entered into joint ventures and partnerships with unrelated third parties to acquire real estate assets that are either consolidated and included in   Real estate owned   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and are included in   Investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company consolidates the entities that we control as well as any variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. In addition, the Company consolidates any joint venture or partnership in which we are the general partner or managing member and the third party does not have the ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process nor the ability to remove us as general partner or managing member without cause. 
    
  UDR s joint ventures and partnerships are funded with a combination of debt and equity. Our losses are limited to our investment and except as noted below, the Company does not guarantee any debt, capital payout or other obligations associated with our joint ventures and partnerships.

As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land and it is no longer accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 3,   Real Estate Owned  ). The parcel of land was previously held in the UDR/MetLife I joint venture.

The parcels of land were previously held in the UDR/MetLife I joint venture and are no longer accounted for as unconsolidated joint ventures.  
           (b) 
    The number of apartment homes for the communities under development presented in the table above is based on the projected number of total homes. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   447   apartment homes had been completed in Other UDR/MetLife Development Joint Ventures, and   no   apartment homes had been completed in UDR/MetLife I. 
              (c)  
    In September 2015, the 717 Olympic community, which is owned by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, experienced extensive water damage due to a ruptured water pipe. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a casualty gain of   $4.6 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively, its proportionate share of the total gain recognized, as a result of insurance proceeds received.  
       In September 2016, the UDR/MetLife II joint venture sold an operating community located in Dallas, Texas with a total of   252   apartment homes for a sales price of approximately   $74.7 million   resulting in a net gain of approximately   $11.5 million   for the Company.  
  On October 3, 2016, the Company increased its ownership from   50%   to   100%   in   two   operating communities located in Bellevue, Washington with a total of   331   apartment homes for a cash purchase price of approximately   $70.3 million  , including closing costs, and assumed secured debt of   $75.8 million   with a weighted average interest rate of   3.67%  . As a result, as of October 3, 2016, the Company consolidated the operating communities and they are no longer accounted for as unconsolidated joint ventures (see Note 3,   Real Estate Owned  ). The operating communities were held in the UDR/MetLife II joint venture as of September 30, 2016. 
           (d) 
    In June 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from   50%   to   100%   in a parcel of land in Los Angeles, California for a purchase price of approximately   $20.1 million  , including closing costs. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land and it is no longer accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 3,   Real Estate Owned  ). The parcel of land was previously held in Other/UDR MetLife Development Joint Ventures. 
              (e) 
    In September 2016, one of the five communities held by the West Coast Joint Venture achieved stabilization, which is defined as when a community reaches   80%   occupancy for   90   consecutive days. Upon stabilization, income and expense are shared based on each partner's ownership percentage and the Company no longer receives a   6.5%   preferred return on its investment in the stabilized community. The remaining four communities have not achieved stabilization and the Company continues to receive a   6.5%   preferred return on its investment in those communities.  
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had deferred fees and deferred profit from the sale of properties to joint ventures or partnerships of   $8.7 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively, which will be recognized through income over the weighted average life of the related properties, upon the disposition of the properties to a third party, or upon completion of certain development obligations.  
  The Company recognized management fees for our management of the joint ventures and partnerships of   $3.0 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $8.4 million   and   $8.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The management fees are included in   Joint venture management and other fees   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The Company may, in the future, make additional capital contributions to certain of our joint ventures and partnerships should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund acquisitions or operations.  
  We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary

For purposes of classification of the above table, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. 
  Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , secured debt encumbered   $1.8 billion   or   19.5%   of UDR s total real estate owned based upon gross book value (  $7.6 billion   or   80.5%   of UDR s real estate owned based on gross book value is unencumbered). 
  (a) At   September 30, 2016  , fixed rate mortgage notes payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest and mature at various dates from   February 2017   through   June 2026   and carry interest rates ranging from   3.35%   to   5.86%  .  
  On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into a   $25.0 million   fixed rate mortgage note due June 5, 2026 with an interest rate of   3.35%  . Interest is payable monthly beginning on July 5, 2016. 
  The Company will from time to time acquire properties subject to fixed rate debt instruments. In those situations, the Company records the debt at its estimated fair value and amortizes any difference between the fair value and par value to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument. The Company had a reduction to interest expense based on the amortization of the fair market adjustment of debt assumed in the acquisition of properties of   $0.6 million   and   $1.3 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2.1 million   and   $3.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The unamortized fair market adjustment was a net premium of   $7.8 million   and   $10.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  (b) UDR has   three   secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of   $636.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The Fannie Mae credit facilities mature at various dates from   May 2017   through   July 2023   and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $355.8 million   of the outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of   5.06%   and the remaining balance of   $280.9 million   had a weighted average variable interest rate of   2.00%  . The Company prepaid a portion of the secured credit facility due in   May 2017   with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering in August 2016, as described in (i) below.  
  Further information related to these credit facilities is as follows   (dollars in thousands)  : 

(c) In July 2016, the Company paid off the   $31.3 million   variable rate mortgage note payable with borrowings under its   $1.1 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  (d) The variable rate mortgage notes payable that secure tax-exempt housing bond issues mature in   August 2019   and   March 2032  . Interest on these notes is payable in monthly installments. The variable rate mortgage notes have interest rates ranging from   1.37%   to   1.48%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  (e) As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a   $1.1 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and a   $350.0 million   senior unsecured term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ). The credit agreement for these facilities (the "Credit Agreement") allows the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the total borrowings under the Term Loan Facility to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to   $2.0 billion  , subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of   January 31, 2020  , with   two     six  -month extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan Facility has a scheduled maturity date of   January 29, 2021  .

Based on the Company s current credit rating, the Revolving Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of   90   basis points and a facility fee of   15   basis points, and the Term Loan Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of   95   basis points. Depending on the Company s credit rating, the margin under the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from   85   to   155   basis points, the facility fee ranges from   12.5   to   30   basis points, and the margin under the Term Loan Facility ranges from   90   to   175   basis points.  
    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and financial and other affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, in certain cases subject to customary periods to cure. The occurrence of an event of default, following the applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the unpaid principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. 
    
  The following is a summary of short-term bank borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (dollars in thousands):

Based on the Company s current credit rating, the Working Capital Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of   90   basis points. Depending on the Company s credit rating, the margin ranges from   85   to   155   basis points.  
    
  In July 2016, the Company amended the working capital credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from   $30 million   to   $75 million  . The scheduled maturity date and interest rate were unchanged by the amendment.

7. INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income/(loss) per share for the periods presented   (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data): 

Basic income/(loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income/(loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the common shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the OP Units and DownREIT Units, convertible preferred stock, stock options, unvested long-term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units") and unvested restricted stock. Only those instruments having a dilutive impact on our basic income/(loss) per share are included in diluted income/(loss) per share during the periods. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's Series E preferred stock was anti-dilutive.

The following table sets forth the additional shares of common stock outstanding by equity instrument if converted to common stock for each of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015     (shares in thousands)  : 

8. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership 
  Interests in the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership held by limited partners are represented by OP Units and DownREIT Units, respectively. The income is allocated to holders of OP Units/DownREIT Units based upon net income attributable to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership. 
  Limited partners of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership have the right to require such partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units/DownREIT Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable), provided that such OP Units/DownREIT Units have been outstanding for at least one year, subject to certain exceptions. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units/DownREIT Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of common stock of the Company for each OP Unit/DownREIT Unit), as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable. Accordingly, the Company records the OP Units and DownREIT Units outside of permanent equity and reports the OP Units and DownREIT Units at their redemption value using the Company s stock price at each balance sheet date.

The following sets forth net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders and transfers from redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership for the following periods   (dollars in thousands)  : 

Noncontrolling Interests  
  Noncontrolling interests represent interests of unrelated partners and unvested LTIP Units in certain consolidated affiliates.   Net (income)/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests   was   $(0.1) million   and less than   $0.1 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $(0.4) million   and less than   $(0.1) million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company grants LTIP Units to certain employees and non-employee directors. The LTIP Units represent an ownership interest in the Operating Partnership and have vesting terms of between one and three years, specific to the individual grants.  
  Noncontrolling interests related to long-term incentive plan units represent the unvested LTIP Units of these employees and non-employee directors in the Operating Partnership. The net income/(loss) allocated to the LTIP Units is included in   Net (income)/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
   
  9. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below: 
             
    Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

  (d)  See Note 8,   Noncontrolling Interests. 
    
  There were   no   transfers into or out of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value 
  The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. 
  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In conjunction with the FASB s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. 
  Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership have a redemption feature and are marked to their redemption value. The redemption value is based on the fair value of the Company s common stock at the redemption date, and therefore, is calculated based on the fair value of the Company s common stock at the balance sheet date. Since the valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership are classified as Level 2. 
  Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  We estimate the fair value of our notes receivable and debt instruments by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in determining a replacement market credit spread include general market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time remaining to maturity, loan-to-value ratios and collateral quality, where applicable (Level 3). 
  We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. Our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based upon Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions. 
  We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company did not incur any other-than-temporary decrease in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  After determining an other-than-temporary decrease in the value of an equity method investment has occurred, we estimate the fair value of our investment by estimating the proceeds we would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation of the investment at the date of measurement. Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the investment giving consideration to the terms of the joint venture agreement and the estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated from the underlying joint venture assets. The inputs and assumptions utilized to estimate the future cash flows of the underlying assets are based upon the Company s evaluation of the economy, market trends, operating results, and other factors, including judgments regarding costs to complete any construction activities, lease up and occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation rates, capitalization rates utilized to estimate the projected cash flows at the disposition, and discount rates.

10. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY 
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings. 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net   in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   no   ineffectiveness to earnings. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized a loss of less than   $0.1 million   reclassified from Accumulated OCI to   Interest expense   due to the de-designation of a cash flow hedge and recorded no other ineffectiveness to earnings. 
  Amounts reported in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net   in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to derivatives that will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. Through   September 30,     2017  , the Company estimates that an additional   $2.8 million   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (  dollars in thousands  ): 

(a) The three interest rate swaps noted in the table above mature in January and April 2017. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of   $315.0 million  , which are effective in January and April 2017 and mature in January 2020. 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of GAAP. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings and resulted in an adjustment to earnings of less than   $0.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Certain of the Company s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where, if there is a change in the Company s financial condition that materially changes the Company s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the Company may be required to fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative instrument.  
  The Company also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of the Company s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement. 
  The Company has certain agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, in the event of default by the Company or the counterparty, the right of setoff may be exercised. Any amount payable to one party by the other party may be reduced by its setoff against any amounts payable by the other party. Events that give rise to default by either party may include, but are not limited to, the failure to pay or deliver payment under the derivative agreement, the failure to comply with or perform under the derivative agreement, bankruptcy, a merger without assumption of the derivative agreement, or in a merger, a surviving entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than the original party to the derivative agreement. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was   $2.0 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at   September 30, 2016  , it may have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $2.0 million  .

  13. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
  GAAP guidance requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing such segments  performance. UDR s chief operating decision maker is comprised of several members of its executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business for our reportable operating segments. 
  UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for UDR s apartment communities are rental income and net operating income ( NOI ). Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing.

     Table of Contents  
  UDR, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as   2.75%   of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent. UDR s chief operating decision maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss. 
  UDR s   two   reportable segments are   Same-Store Communities   and   Non-Mature Communities/Other  : 

Same-Store Communities   represent those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to   July 1, 2015   for quarter-to-date comparison and   January 1, 2015   for year-to-date comparison and held as of   September 30, 2016  . A comparison of operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior period, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves   90%   occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 

Non-Mature Communities/Other   represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in   Same-Store Communities  , including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.  
     Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on a   Same-Store Community   and   Non-Mature Community/Other   basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with the aggregation criteria under GAAP as each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Company s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
  All revenues are from external customers and   no   single tenant or related group of tenants contributed   10% or more   of UDR s total revenues during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

1. CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Basis of Presentation  
  United Dominion Realty, L.P. ( UDR, L.P.,  the  Operating Partnership,   we  or  our ) is a Delaware limited partnership, that owns, acquires, renovates, redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier to entry markets located in the United States. The high barrier to entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. UDR, L.P. is a subsidiary of UDR, Inc. ( UDR  or the  General Partner ), a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, through which UDR conducts a significant portion of its business. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , rental revenues of the Operating Partnership represented   43%   and   53%  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   43%   and   53%  , respectively, of the General Partner s consolidated rental revenues. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership s apartment portfolio consisted of   56   communities located in   14   markets consisting of   16,974   apartment homes.  
  Interests in UDR, L.P. are represented by operating partnership units ( OP Units ). The Operating Partnership s net income is allocated to the partners, which is initially based on their respective distributions made during the year and secondly, their percentage interests. Distributions are made in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership Agreement ), on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the dividend per share on UDR s common stock, which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the ticker symbol  UDR.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   183,278,698   OP Units outstanding, of which   174,227,479   or   95.1%   were owned by UDR and affiliated entities and   9,051,219   or   4.9%   were owned by non-affiliated limited partners. See Note 9,   Capital Structure  .    
  The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted according to such rules and regulations, although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and eliminations necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been included. Such adjustments are normal and recurring in nature. The interim results presented are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for a full year. The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by UDR and the Operating Partnership with the SEC on   February 23, 2016  . 
  The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.    
  The Operating Partnership evaluated subsequent events through the date its financial statements were issued. No recognized or non-recognized subsequent events were noted. 
   
  2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The ASU addresses specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice, including the treatment of distributions received from equity method investees. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on

January 1, 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented; early adoption is permitted. The Operating Partnership does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The standard requires entities to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss for most financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, and to present the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2020; early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2019. The Operating Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The ASU aims to simplify the accounting for share-based payments by amending the accounting for forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification in the statements of cash flow and income taxes. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The update requires a prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective approach, depending on the type of amendment. The Operating Partnership does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The standard amends the existing lease accounting guidance and requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of one year or less) on their balance sheets. Lessees will continue to recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, accounting for leases under the new guidance is substantially the same as in prior periods, but eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the treatment of initial direct costs. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparable period presented, with an option to elect certain transition relief. Full retrospective application is prohibited. The standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Operating Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model of consolidation. Under ASU 2015-02, companies will need to re-evaluate whether an entity meets the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity ( VIE ) or whether the consolidation of an entity should be assessed under the voting model. The new standard specifically eliminates the presumption in the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless that presumption can be overcome. The new standard was effective for the Operating Partnership beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard did not result in the consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or the deconsolidation of any entities previously consolidated. Upon adopting the new standard, UDR Lighthouse DownREIT L.P. (the  DownREIT Partnership ) became a VIE as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the DownREIT Partnership and will continue to account for its interest as an equity method investment.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard specifically excludes lease contracts. The ASU allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method, and the standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2018; early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2017. The Operating Partnership has not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Principles of Consolidation 
  The Operating Partnership accounts for subsidiary partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities in which it holds an ownership interest in accordance with the amended consolidation guidance. The Operating Partnership first evaluates whether each entity is a VIE. Under the VIE model, the Operating Partnership consolidates an entity when it has control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, the Operating Partnership consolidates an entity when it controls the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  In accordance with GAAP, a discontinued operation represents (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale in a single transaction and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity s financial results, or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition. A strategic shift could include a disposal of (1) a separate major line of business, (2) a separate major geographic area of operations, (3) a major equity method investment, or (4) other major parts of an entity.  
  We record sales of real estate that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation in   Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned, net of tax     on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Income/(Loss) Per Operating Partnership Unit 
  Basic income/(loss) per OP Unit is computed by dividing net income/(loss) attributable to the general and limited partner unitholders by the weighted average number of general and limited partner units outstanding during the year. Diluted income/(loss) per OP Unit reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue OP Units were exercised or converted into OP Units or resulted in the issuance of OP Units and then shared in the income/(loss) of the Operating Partnership. 
  Revenue and Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition 
  Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents and tenants in accordance with GAAP. Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and recognized when earned. The Operating Partnership recognizes interest income, fees and incentives when earned, fixed and determinable. 
  For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit recognition, we remove the related assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an alternate method of accounting. Unless certain limited criteria are met, non-monetary transactions, including property exchanges, are accounted for at fair value. 
  Sales to entities in which we or our General Partner retain or otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to the outside interest in the buyer and defer the gain on the interest we or our General Partner retain. The Operating Partnership recognizes any deferred gain when the property is sold to a third party. In transactions accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the entire property.

Comprehensive Income/(Loss) 
  Comprehensive income/(loss), which is defined as the change in equity during each period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources, including all changes in equity during a period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to unitholders, is displayed in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss). For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Operating Partnership s other comprehensive income/(loss) consisted of the gain/(loss) (effective portion) on derivative instruments that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges and (gain)/loss reclassified from other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings. The (gain)/loss reclassified from other comprehensive income/(loss) is included in   Interest expense   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 8,   Derivatives and Hedging Activity,   for further discussion.  
  Income Taxes 
  The taxable income or loss of the Operating Partnership is reported on the tax returns of the partners. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for federal or state income taxes on income that is passed through to the partners. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are recorded at the entity level. The Operating Partnership s tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. Net income for financial reporting purposes differs from the net income for income tax reporting purposes primarily due to temporary differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets. 
  The Operating Partnership evaluates the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Operating Partnership s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management of the Operating Partnership is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. The Operating Partnership has no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time. 
  Management of the Operating Partnership has reviewed all open tax years (  2013   through   2015  ) of tax jurisdictions and concluded there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns. 
   
  3. REAL ESTATE OWNED 
  Real estate assets owned by the Operating Partnership consist of income producing operating properties, properties under development, land held for future development, and sold or held for disposition properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership owned and consolidated   56   communities in   eight   states plus the District of Columbia totaling   16,974   apartment homes. The following table summarizes the carrying amounts for our real estate owned (at cost) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (dollars in thousands)  :  

The Operating Partnership did   not   have any acquisitions or sales of real estate during the   nine months ended

  UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

September 30, 2016  . 
  In September 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to sell   two   operating communities with a total of   276   apartment homes for a sales price of approximately   $45.3 million  . The operating communities were classified as held for disposition as of September 30, 2016 and the sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.      
    
  Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as     Total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation  . The Operating Partnership capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, were   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.7 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total interest capitalized was less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Operating Partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life. 

4. UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES 
  The Operating Partnership's investment in the DownREIT Partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is included in   Investment in unconsolidated entities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Operating Partnership recognizes earnings or losses from its investments in unconsolidated entities consisting of our share of the net earnings or losses of the partnership in accordance with the partnership agreement. 
  Upon adopting ASU 2015-02, the DownREIT Partnership became a VIE as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the DownREIT Partnership as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance and will continue to account for its interest as an equity method investment. See Note 2,   Significant Accounting Policies  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the DownREIT Partnership operated   13   communities with   6,261   apartment homes. The Operating Partnership s investment in the DownREIT Partnership was   $121.4 million   and   $166.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

5. DEBT, NET 
  Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. For purposes of classification in the following table, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed as fixed rate debt due to the Operating Partnership having effectively established the fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. Secured debt consists of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (  dollars in thousands  ): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate commitment of   $408.5 million   of the General Partner's secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae was allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt. The entire commitment was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . The portions of the Fannie Mae credit facilities allocated to the Operating Partnership mature at various dates from   December 2018   through   July 2023   and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $244.9 million   of the outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of   5.05%   and the remaining balance of   $163.6 million   on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of   2.22%  .  
  The following information relates to the credit facilities allocated to the Operating Partnership   (dollars in thousands)  : 

The Operating Partnership may from time to time acquire properties subject to fixed rate debt instruments. In those situations, management will record the secured debt at its estimated fair value and amortize any difference between the fair value and par to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument. The Operating Partnership did not have any unamortized fair value adjustments associated with the fixed rate debt instruments on the Operating Partnership's properties.

6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Advances (To)/From the General Partner 
  The Operating Partnership participates in the General Partner s central cash management program, wherein all the Operating Partnership s cash receipts are remitted to the General Partner and all cash disbursements are funded by the General Partner. In addition, other miscellaneous costs such as administrative expenses are incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Operating Partnership. As a result of these various transactions between the Operating Partnership and the General Partner, the Operating Partnership had net   Advances (to)/from General Partner   of   $43.3 million   and   $(11.3) million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which are reflected as increases/decreases of capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Allocation of General and Administrative Expenses 
  The General Partner provides various general and administrative and other overhead services for the Operating Partnership including legal assistance, acquisitions analysis, marketing and advertising, and allocates these expenses to the Operating Partnership first on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on its pro-rata portion of UDR s total apartment homes. The general and administrative expenses allocated to the Operating Partnership by UDR were   $4.3 million   and   $6.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $11.8 million   and   $16.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are included in   General and administrative   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the opinion of management, this method of allocation reflects the level of services received by the Operating Partnership from the General Partner. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Operating Partnership incurred   $3.1 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively, and during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Operating Partnership incurred   $10.4 million   and   $13.3 million  , respectively, of related party management fees related to a management agreement entered into in 2011 with wholly-owned subsidiaries of UDR's taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") (See further discussion in paragraph below). These related party management fees are initially recorded in   General and administrative   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and a portion related to management fees charged by UDR's TRS is reclassified to   Property management   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (See further discussion below.) 
  Management Fee 
  In 2011, the Operating Partnership entered into a management agreement with wholly owned subsidiaries of UDR's TRSs. Under the management agreement, the Operating Partnership is charged a management fee equal to   2.75%   of gross rental revenues, which is classified in   Property management   on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  Notes Payable to General Partner 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Operating Partnership had   $273.3 million   of unsecured notes payable to the General Partner at annual interest rates between   4.12%   and   5.34%  . Certain limited partners of the Operating Partnership have provided guarantees related to these notes payable. The guarantees were provided by the limited partners in conjunction with their contribution of properties to the Operating Partnership. The notes mature on   August 31, 2021  ,   December 31, 2023   and   April 1, 2026  , and interest payments are made monthly. The Operating Partnership recognized interest expense on the notes payable of   $3.1 million   and   $1.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $9.2 million   and   $3.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

7. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below:  
             
    Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 
     The estimated fair values of the Operating Partnership s financial instruments either recorded or disclosed on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows   (dollars in thousands)  :

  Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value 
  The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. 
  The General Partner, on behalf of the Operating Partnership, incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Operating Partnership has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 
  Although the General Partner, on behalf of the Operating Partnership, has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Operating Partnership has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Operating Partnership has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In conjunction with the FASB s fair value measurement guidance, the Operating Partnership made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Operating Partnership using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Operating Partnership would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  Fair value of our debt instruments is estimated by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in determining a replacement market credit spread include general market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time remaining to maturity, loan-to-value ratios and collateral quality (Level 3). 
  The Operating Partnership records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. The General Partner s estimates of fair value represent management s estimates based upon Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions. 
   
  8. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY 
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Operating Partnership is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The General Partner principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The General Partner manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the General Partner enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The General Partner s and the Operating Partnership s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the General Partner s known or expected cash payments principally related to the General Partner s borrowings. 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The General Partner s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the General Partner primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the General Partner making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front premium. 
  A portion of the General Partner s interest rate derivatives have been allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the General Partner s underlying debt instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership. (See Note 5,   Debt, Net.  ) 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net   in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. The

Operating Partnership recorded   no   gain or loss from ineffectiveness during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Amounts reported in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net   related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the General Partner s variable-rate debt that is allocated to the Operating Partnership. Through   September 30,     2017  , we estimate that less than   $0.1 million   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (  dollars in thousands  ):

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
  The General Partner has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the General Partner defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the General Partner could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations; or (2) the General Partner could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the General Partner s default on the indebtedness. 
  Certain of the General Partner s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where if there is a change in the General Partner s financial condition that materially changes the General Partner s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the General Partner may be required to fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative instrument. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   cash collateral was posted or required to be posted by the General Partner or by a counterparty. 
  The General Partner also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of the General Partner s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant provisions would result in the General Partner being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement. 
  The General Partner has certain agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where in the event of default by the General Partner or the counterparty, the right of setoff may be exercised. Any amount payable to one party by the other party may be reduced by its setoff against any amounts payable by the other party. Events that give rise to default by either party may include, but are not limited to, the failure to pay or deliver payment under the derivative agreement, the failure to comply with or perform under the derivative agreement, bankruptcy, a merger without assumption of the derivative agreement, or in a merger, a surviving entity s creditworthiness is materially weaker than the original party to the derivative agreement.

  9. CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
  General Partnership Units  
  The General Partner has complete discretion to manage and control the operations and business of the Operating Partnership, which includes but is not limited to the acquisition and disposition of real property, construction of buildings and making capital improvements, and the borrowing of funds from outside lenders or UDR and its subsidiaries to finance such activities. The General Partner can generally authorize, issue, sell, redeem or purchase any OP Unit or securities of the Operating Partnership without the approval of the limited partners. The General Partner can also approve, with regard to the issuances of OP Units, the class or one or more series of classes, with designations, preferences, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties including rights, powers and duties senior to limited partnership interests without approval of any limited partners except holders of Class A Limited Partnership Units. There were   110,883   General Partnership units outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all of which were held by UDR. 
  Limited Partnership Units 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   183,167,815   limited partnership units outstanding, of which   1,873,332   were Class A Limited Partnership Units. UDR owned   174,116,596  , or   95.1%  , and   174,114,516  , or   95.1%  , of OP Units outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which   121,661   were Class A Limited

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

Partnership Units. The remaining   9,051,219  , or   4.9%  , and   9,053,299  , or   4.9%  , of OP Units outstanding were held by non-affiliated partners at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which   1,751,671   were Class A Limited Partnership Units. 
  Subject to the terms of the Operating Partnership Agreement, the limited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement), provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least   one   year. UDR, as general partner of the Operating Partnership, may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of common stock of UDR for each OP Unit), as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement. 
  The non-affiliated limited partners  capital is adjusted to redemption value at the end of each reporting period with the corresponding offset against UDR s limited partner capital account based on the redemption rights noted above. The aggregate value upon redemption of the then-outstanding OP Units held by limited partners was   $325.8 million   and   $340.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on the value of UDR s common stock at each period end. A limited partner has no right to receive any distributions from the Operating Partnership on or after the date of redemption of its OP Units. 
  Class A Limited Partnership Units 
  Class A Limited Partnership Units have a cumulative, annual, non-compounded preferred return, which is equal to   8%   based on a value of   $16.61   per Class A Limited Partnership Unit. 
  Holders of the Class A Limited Partnership Units exclusively possess certain voting rights. The Operating Partnership may not do the following without approval of the holders of the Class A Limited Partnership Units: (i) increase the authorized or issued amount of Class A Limited Partnership Units, (ii) reclassify any other partnership interest into Class A Limited Partnership Units, (iii) create, authorize or issue any obligations or security convertible into or the right to purchase any Class A Limited Partnership units, (iv) enter into a merger or acquisition, or (v) amend or modify the Operating Partnership Agreement in a manner that adversely affects the relative rights, preferences or privileges of the Class A Limited Partnership Units. 
  LTIP Units 
  UDR grants long-term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units") to certain employees and non-employee directors. The LTIP Units represent an ownership interest in the Operating Partnership and have voting and distribution rights consistent with OP Units. The LTIP Units are subject to the terms of UDR's long-term incentive plan. 
  Two classes of LTIP Units are granted, Class 1 LTIP Units and Class 2 LTIP Units. Class 1 LTIP Units are granted to non-employee directors and vest after one year. Class 2 LTIP Units are granted to certain employees and vest over a period from one to three years subject to certain performance and market conditions being achieved. Vested LTIP Units may be converted into OP Units provided that such LTIP Units have been outstanding for at least two years from the date of grant. 
  Allocation of Profits and Losses 
  Profit of the Operating Partnership is allocated in the following order: (i) to the General Partner and the Limited Partners in proportion to and up to the amount of cash distributions made during the year, and (ii) to the General Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage interests. Losses and depreciation and amortization expenses, non-recourse liabilities are allocated to the General Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage interests. Losses allocated to the Limited Partners are capped to the extent that such an allocation would not cause a deficit in the Limited Partners  capital account. Such losses are, therefore, allocated to the General Partner. If any Partner s capital balance were to fall into a deficit, any income and gains are allocated to each Partner sufficient to eliminate its negative capital balance.

  Contingencies 
  Litigation and Legal Matters 
  The Operating Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Operating Partnership cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and claims at this time. The General Partner believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on the Operating Partnership s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. 
   
  11. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
  GAAP guidance requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing such segments  performance. The Operating Partnership has the same chief operating decision maker as that of its parent, the General Partner. The chief operating decision maker consists of several members of UDR s executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business for our reportable operating segments. 
  The Operating Partnership owns and operates multifamily apartment communities throughout the United States that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures of the Operating Partnership s apartment communities are rental income and net operating income ( NOI ), and are included in the chief operating decision maker s assessment of the Operating Partnership s performance on a consolidated basis. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct property operating expenses. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as   2.75%   of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent. The chief operating decision maker of the General Partner utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss. 
  The Operating Partnership s   two   reportable segments are   Same-Store Communities   and   Non-Mature Communities/Other: 

Same-Store Communities   represent those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to   July 1, 2015   for quarter-to-date comparison and   January 1, 2015   for the year-to-date comparison and held as of   September 30, 2016  . A comparison of operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior period, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves   90%   occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 

Non-Mature Communities/Other   represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in   Same-Store Communities  , including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Management of the General Partner evaluates the performance of each of the Operating Partnership s apartment communities on a   Same-Store Community   and   Non-Mature Community/Other   basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with the aggregation criteria under GAAP as each of the apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Operating Partnership s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
  All revenues are from external customers and   no   single tenant or related group of tenants contributed   10% or more   of the Operating Partnership s total revenues during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The following table details rental income and NOI for the Operating Partnership s reportable segments for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and reconciles NOI to   Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders   in the Consolidated Statements of Operations   (dollars in thousands)  : 

(a)  Same-Store Community   population consisted of   14,001   apartment homes.

  UDR, Inc.: 
  Business Overview  
  UDR, Inc. is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to  we,   us,   our,   the Company,  or  UDR  refer collectively to UDR, Inc., its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated real estate portfolio included   132   communities in   10   states plus the District of Columbia totaling   40,728   apartment homes. In addition, we had an ownership interest in   28   communities with   6,891   apartment homes through unconsolidated operating communities. The   Same-Store Community   apartment home population for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   32,472   and   32,310  , respectively.

The following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

(a) 
    Monthly Income per Occupied Home represents total monthly revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes.  
       
           (b) 
    The Company is currently developing   two   wholly-owned communities with   1,101   apartment homes, of which   none   have been completed as of   September 30, 2016  . 
     We report in two segments:   Same-Store Communities   and   Non-Mature Communities/Other  .  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

Our   Same-Store Communities   segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to   July 1, 2015   for quarter-to-date comparison and   January 1, 2015   for year-to-date comparison and held as of   September 30, 2016  . These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior period, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.  
  Our   Non-Mature Communities/Other   segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in   Same-Store Communities  , including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. 
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, sales of properties, borrowings under our credit agreements, and/or the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements. We routinely use our unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio. 
  We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities, and potential property acquisitions, through secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or the disposition of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT requirements. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, borrowings under credit agreements, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and dispositions of properties. 
  We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance. 
  On August 23, 2016, the Company issued   $300 million   of   2.95%   senior unsecured medium-term notes due September 1, 2026. Interest is payable semi-annually beginning on March 1, 2017. The notes were priced at   100%   of the principal amount at issuance. The Company used the net proceeds to prepay secured debt due in May 2017, pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding on its   $1.1 billion   unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. 
  On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into a   $25.0 million   fixed rate mortgage note due June 5, 2026 with an interest rate of   3.35%  . Interest is payable monthly.  
  On March 4, 2016, the Company sold   5,000,000   shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately   $173.7 million   at a price per share of   $34.73  . Aggregate net proceeds from the sale, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering-related expenses, were approximately $173.3 million, which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
  In April 2012, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement, which was amended in July 2014, under which the Company may offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not sell any shares of common stock through this program. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   13.1 million   shares of common stock available for future issuance under the April 2012 program. 
  Future Capital Needs 
  Future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through borrowings under unsecured or secured credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities, sales of properties, and, to a lesser extent, from cash flow provided by property operations. Acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures, by the  
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $0.8 million   of secured debt maturing, inclusive of principal amortization, and   no   unsecured debt maturing, during the remainder of   2016  .  
  We anticipate repaying that debt with cash flow from our operations, proceeds from debt or equity offerings, proceeds from dispositions of properties, or from borrowings under our credit agreements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and New Accounting Pronouncements  
  Our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These policies include those related to (1) capital expenditures, (2) impairment of long-lived assets, (3) real estate investment properties, and (4) revenue recognition. 
  Our critical accounting policies are described in more detail in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in UDR s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on   February 23, 2016  . There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies from those reported in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   February 23, 2016  . With respect to these critical accounting policies, we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. 
  Statements of Cash Flows 
  The following discussion explains the changes in   Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities  ,   Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities  , and   Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities   that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Operating Activities  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our   Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities   was   $383.1 million   compared to   $305.8 million   for the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved net operating income, primarily driven by revenue growth at communities and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
  Investing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities   was   $(271.6) million   compared to   $(228.2) million   for the comparable period in   2015  . The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of real estate assets, increased development of real estate assets, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of real estate assets, decreased distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures and transfers to escrow for IRC Section 1031 exchanges, partially offset by decreased cash used for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and decreased capital expenditures. 
  Acquisitions 
    
  In June 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from   50%   to   100%   in a parcel of land in Los Angeles, California for a purchase price of approximately   $20.1 million  , including closing costs. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its   50%   interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture. We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by   $31.1 million  . Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company entered into a triple-net operating ground lease for the parcel of land at market terms with a third-party developer. The lessee plans to construct a multi-family community on the parcel of land. The ground lease provides the ground lessee with options to buy the fee interest in the parcel of land. The lease term is   49   years plus two   25  -year extension options, does not transfer ownership to the lessee, and does not include a bargain purchase option. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from   5%   to   100%   in a parcel of land in Dublin, California for a purchase price of approximately   $8.5 million  , including closing costs. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its   5%   interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture. We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by   $8.9 million  .  
  
   64 

Dispositions  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company sold a retail center in Bellevue, Washington and its   95%   ownership interest in   two   parcels of land in Santa Monica, California for total gross proceeds of   $69.4 million  , resulting in total net proceeds of   $66.1 million   and a total gain, net of tax, of   $10.4 million  . A portion of the proceeds related to the sale of the retail center in Bellevue, Washington were designated for Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 1031 exchanges. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $17.8 million   of these proceeds were included in   Funds held in escrow from Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchanges   on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
  We capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred. 
  Total capital expenditures, which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations, of   $83.4 million   or   $2,049   per stabilized home were spent on all of our communities, excluding real estate under development, non-stabilized communities, and commercial properties for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $79.3 million   or   $2,033   per stabilized home for the comparable period in   2015  . 
  The increase in total capital expenditures was primarily due to: 
             
    an   increase   of   25.7%   or   $6.9 million   in revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, such as kitchen and bath remodels and upgrades to common areas. 
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    a   decrease   of   14.1%   or   $3.0 million   in major renovations, primarily due to lower redevelopment spend. 
     The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real estate under development, non-stabilized communities, and commercial properties, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a) 
    Average number of homes is calculated based on the number of stabilized homes outstanding at the end of each month. 
     This table reports amounts capitalized during the year. Actual capital spending is impacted by the net change in capital expenditure accruals. 
  We intend to continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital. Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement. Recurring capital expenditures during   2016   are projected to be approximately $1,150 per home. 
  
   65 

Consolidated Real Estate Under Development and Redevelopment 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our development pipeline for two wholly-owned communities totaled   1,101   homes, of which   none   have been completed, with a budget of   $708.5 million  , in which we have a carrying value of   $294.8 million  . The communities are estimated to be completed during the first quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was redeveloping four communities, located in San Francisco, California, Newport Beach, California, Austin, Texas, and Dallas, Texas, which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The redevelopment includes the renovation of building exteriors, corridors, and common area amenities as well as individual apartment homes. 
  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Partnerships 
  The Company recognizes income or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net income or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships. In addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to the unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships. 
  The Company s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, net, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our proportionate share of the net income/(loss) of the joint ventures and partnerships was   $16.3 million  , our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures increased by   $29.8 million   primarily due to making capital contributions, and we received distributions of   $52.3 million  , of which   $19.8 million   were operating cash flows and   $32.5 million   were investing cash flows. 
  The Company may, in the future, make additional capital contributions to certain of our joint ventures and partnerships should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund acquisitions, development or operations.  
  We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary decreases in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Financing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our   Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities   was   $(115.0) million   compared to   $(91.5) million   for the comparable period of   2015  . 
  The following significant financing activities occurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 
                 
    net proceeds of   $96.9 million   under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facilities; 
                 
    paid distributions of   $230.1 million   to our common stockholders. 
       
  Credit Facilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   three   secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of   $636.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The Fannie Mae credit facilities mature at various dates from   May 2017   through   July 2023   and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $355.8 million   of the outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of   5.06%   and the remaining balance of   $280.9 million   had a weighted average variable interest rate of   2.00%  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a   $1.1 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and a   $350.0 million   senior unsecured term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ). The credit agreement for these  
  
   66 

facilities includes an accordion feature that allows the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the total borrowings under the Term Loan Facility to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to   $2.0 billion  , subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of   January 31, 2020  , with   two     six  -month extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan Facility has a scheduled maturity date of   January 29, 2021  . Based on the Company s current credit rating, the Revolving Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of   90   basis points and a facility fee of   15   basis points, and the Term Loan Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 95 basis points. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $180.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving   $920.0 million   of unused capacity (excluding   $2.9 million   of letters of credit at   September 30, 2016  ), and   $315.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a working capital credit facility, which provides for a   $75 million   unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Working Capital Credit Facility ) with a scheduled maturity date of January 1, 2019. Based on the Company s current credit rating, the Working Capital Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of   90   basis points. Depending on the Company s credit rating, the margin ranges from   85   to   155   basis points. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $66.9 million   of outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Credit Facility, leaving   $8.1 million   of unused capacity. 
       
  In July 2016, the Company amended the working capital credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from   $30 million   to   $75 million  . The scheduled maturity date and interest rate were unchanged by the amendment. 
  The Fannie Mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations, all of which we were in compliance with at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had   $657.6 million   in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . If market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   would have increased by   $5.2 million   based on the average balance outstanding during the period. 
  These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. This analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. 
  The Company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. See Note 10,   Derivatives and Hedging Activities  , in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional discussion of derivate instruments. 
  A presentation of cash flow metrics based on GAAP is as follows (  dollars in thousands  ):

Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders  
    
    Net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders   was   $26.0 million   (  $0.10   per diluted share) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $12.4 million   (  $0.05   per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior year. The   increase   resulted primarily from the following items, which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report: 

an   increase   in total property NOI of   $16.8 million   primarily due to higher revenue per occupied home and NOI from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in   2016   and   2015   and communities acquired in 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities; and 

an   increase   in income from unconsolidated entities of   $12.6 million   primarily due to the sale of an operating community by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, which resulted in a gain of   $11.5 million   for the Company, and a casualty gain of   $4.6 million  , as a result of insurance proceeds related to a September 2015 event received during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ; 
       
  This was partially offset by:     

an increase in depreciation expense of   $15.2 million   due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets. 
       
    Net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders   was   $52.5 million   (  $0.20   per diluted share) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $171.2 million   (  $0.66   per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior year. The   decrease   resulted primarily from the following items, which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report: 

gains, net of tax, of   $10.4 million   on the sale of a retail center in Bellevue, Washington and two parcels of land in Santa Monica, California, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to gains, net of tax, of   $79.0 million   from the sale of three communities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ; 

a decrease in income from unconsolidated entities of   $45.0 million   due to the sale of an operating community by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, which resulted in a gain of   $11.5 million   for the Company, and a casualty gain of   $3.5 million  , as a result of insurance proceeds related to a September 2015 event received during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the sale of the eight communities held by the Texas Joint Venture, which resulted in a gain of $59.1 million, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ;  

a decrease in joint venture management fees attributable to the promote and fee income of $9.6 million recognized in connection with the sale of the Texas Joint Venture in 2015; and 

an increase in depreciation expense of   $47.4 million   due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets. 
       
  This was partially offset by: 

an   increase   in total property NOI of   $54.2 million   primarily due to higher revenue per occupied home and NOI from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in   2016   and   2015   and communities acquired in 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities.

The following table is our reconciliation of total property NOI to   Net income/(loss) attributable to UDR, Inc.   for each of the periods presented (  dollars in thousands): 

Same-Store Communities 
  Our   Same-Store Community   properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to   July 1, 2015   for quarter-to-date comparison and   January 1, 2015   for year-to-date comparison and held as of   September 30, 2016  ) consisted of   32,472   and   32,310   apartment homes, respectively, and provided   77.5%   and   77.5%   of our total NOI for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015     
    NOI for our   Same-Store Community   properties   increase  d   6.4%   or   $8.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in property NOI was attributable to a 5.3% or $9.3 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 2.5% or $1.3 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in property income was primarily driven by a 5.2% or $8.6 million increase in rental rates and a 6.6% or $0.9 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. Physical occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.8% and total monthly income per occupied home increased 5.2% to $1,966. 
  The   increase   in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 10.3% or $1.8 million increase in real estate taxes, partially offset by a decrease of 18.7% or $0.5 million in insurance expense. 
  The operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) was   71.2%   and   70.4%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015     
    NOI for our   Same-Store Community   properties   increase  d   6.9%   or   $25.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in property NOI was attributable to a 5.9% or $30.5 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 3.5% or $5.3 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in property income was primarily driven by a 5.9% or $29.0 million increase in rental rates and a 6.6% or $2.7 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. Physical occupancy decreased 0.1% to 96.6% and total monthly income per occupied home increased 5.9% to $1,942. 
  The   increase   in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 9.2% or $4.9 million increase in real estate taxes. 
  As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income)   increase  d to   71.3%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   70.6%   for the comparable period in   2015  . 
  Non-Mature Communities/Other 
  UDR s   Non-Mature Communities/Other   represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in   Same-Store Communities  , including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The remaining   22.5%   or   $38.4 million   of our total NOI during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was generated from our   Non-Mature Communities/Other  . NOI from   Non-Mature Communities/Other     increase  d by   29.9%   or   $8.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by an increase in NOI of   $12.1 million   from acquired communities and an increase of $1.2 million from developed and redeveloped communities completed in 2015 and 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in NOI of   $5.1 million   from communities sold or held for disposition in 2015 and 2016. 
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The remaining   22.5%   or   $112.7 million   of our total NOI during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was generated from our   Non-Mature Communities/Other  . NOI from   Non-Mature Communities/Other     increase  d by   34.8%   or   $29.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by an increase in NOI of   $36.1 million   from acquired communities and an increase of $10.6 million from developed and redeveloped communities completed in 2015 and 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in NOI of   $18.4 million   from communities sold or held for disposition in 2015 and 2016.  
    
  Joint Venture Management and Other Fees 
    
  For the   nine months ended   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized income from joint venture management and other fees of   $8.5 million   and   $19.5 million  , respectively. The decrease in income in 2016 as compared to 2015 was attributable to the promote and fee income of $9.6 million recognized in connection with the sale of the Texas Joint Venture in 2015 and the decrease in the number of properties managed in the Company's joint ventures. 
  Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization 
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , real estate depreciation and amortization   increase  d   16.8%   or   $15.2 million   as compared to the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   in depreciation and amortization for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and  communities acquired in 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , real estate depreciation and amortization   increase  d   17.6%   or   $47.4 million   as compared to the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   in depreciation and amortization for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets.

General and Administrative 
    
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expense   decrease  d   25.3%   or   $4.0 million   as compared to the comparable period in   2015  . The   decrease   in general and administrative expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was principally due to a decrease in bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense for awards under the long-term incentive plan primarily due to the departure of our Chief Financial Officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expense   decrease  d   12.5%   or   $5.2 million   as compared to the comparable period in   2015  . The   decrease   in general and administrative expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was principally due to a decrease in long-term incentive plan transition costs and a decrease in bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense for awards under the long-term incentive plan primarily due to the departure of our Chief Financial Officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015, which was partially offset by an increase in healthcare costs and salary and benefit increases. 
    
  Income/(Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities 
    
  For the   three months ended   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized income from unconsolidated entities of   $15.3 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively. This income relates to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships. The increase in income for the   three months ended   2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the sale of an operating community by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, which resulted in a gain of   $11.5 million   for the Company, and a casualty gain of   $4.6 million   as a result of insurance proceeds related to a September 2015 event received in 2016. 
    
  For the   nine months ended   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized income from unconsolidated entities of   $16.3 million   and   $61.3 million  , respectively. This income relates to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships. The decrease in income for the   nine months ended   2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the sale of an operating community by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, which resulted in a gain of   $11.5 million   for the Company, and a casualty gain of   $3.5 million   as a result of insurance proceeds related to a September 2015 event received in 2016, as compared to the sale of eight communities held by the Texas Joint Venture in 2015, which generated gains of $59.1 million in 2015. 
    
  Interest Expense 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , interest expense   increase  d by   5.7%   or   $5.0 million   as compared to the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   in interest expense was principally due to an overall higher weighted average interest rate on total debt, which was primarily a result of lower weighted average daily borrowings under the unsecured credit facility. 
    
  Gain/(Loss) on Sale of Real Estate Owned, Net of Tax 
       During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a gain, net of tax, of   $10.4 million   on the sale of a retail center in Bellevue, Washington and two parcels of land in Santa Monica, California. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized gains, net of tax, of   $79.0 million   on the sale of three communities, located in Clearwater, Florida, Orlando, Florida and Beaverton, Oregon, with 812 apartment homes. 
    
  Inflation 
  We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.

Funds from Operations, Funds from Operations as Adjusted, and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
    
  Funds from Operations 
    
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains or losses from sales of real estate owned, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust s ( NAREIT ) definition issued in April 2002. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance. In the computation of FFO, diluted, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, unvested LTIP Units, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive; they are included in the diluted share count.  
    
  Activities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS )       include development and land entitlement. From time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a TRS property which results in a short-term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs. We believe that the inclusion of these TRS gains in FFO is consistent with the standards established by NAREIT as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.  
    
  We consider FFO a useful metric for investors as we use FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. 
    
  Funds from Operations as Adjusted 
    
  FFO as Adjusted ("FFO as Adjusted") is defined as FFO excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, gains on sales of marketable securities and TRS property, deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases, storm-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal costs. Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs. 
    
  FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that   Net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders   is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. 
    
  Adjusted Funds from Operations 
    
  Adjusted FFO ( AFFO ) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance. AFFO is defined as FFO as Adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities. Therefore, management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company s operational performance than FFO or FFO as Adjusted.  
    
  AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that   Net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders   is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the

operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

United Dominion Realty, L.P.: 
  Business Overview   
  United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership  or  UDR, L.P. ) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in February 2004 and organized pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations on November 4, 1995. Our sole general partner is UDR, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( UDR  or the  General Partner ), which conducts a substantial amount of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through the Operating Partnership. At   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership s real estate portfolio included   56   communities located in   eight   states and the District of Columbia with a total of   16,974   apartment homes.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , UDR owned   110,883   units of our general partnership interests and   174,116,596   units of our limited partnership interests (the  OP Units ), or approximately   95.1%   of our outstanding OP Units. By virtue of its ownership of our OP Units and being our sole general partner, UDR has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this section to the Operating Partnership or  we,   us  or  our  refer to UDR, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. In this section, we refer to the General Partner together with its consolidated subsidiaries (including us) and the General Partner s consolidated joint ventures as  UDR  or the  General Partner.  
  UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. The General Partner was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland in June 2003. At   September 30, 2016  , the General Partner s consolidated real estate portfolio included   132   communities located in   10   states and the District of Columbia with a total of   40,728   apartment homes. In addition, the General Partner had an ownership interest in   28   communities with   6,891   completed apartment homes through unconsolidated operating communities.  
  The Operating Partnership s same-store community apartment home population for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   14,001  .

The following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of   September 30, 2016  :   

(a) 
    Monthly Income per Occupied Home represents total monthly revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes. 
     We report in two segments:   Same-Store Communities   and   Non-Mature Communities/Other  .  
  Our   Same-Store Communities   segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to   July 1, 2015   for quarter-to-date comparison and   January 1, 2015   for year-to-date comparison and held as of   September 30, 2016  . These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior period, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.  
  Our   Non-Mature Communities/Other   segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in   Same-Store Communities  , including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of properties, and the issuance of debt. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. The Operating Partnership s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner s credit agreements. The General Partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio. 
  We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner s credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner s credit agreements.  
  Future Capital Needs 
  Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt, sales of properties, borrowings allocated to us under our General Partner s credit agreements, and to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by operating activities.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership did   not   have any secured debt maturing during the remainder of   2016  .  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and New Accounting Pronouncements  
  Our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These policies include those related to (1) capital expenditures, (2) impairment of long-lived assets, (3) real estate investment properties, and (4) revenue recognition. 
  Our critical accounting policies are described in more detail in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Operating Partnership s current Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on   February 23, 2016  . There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies from those reported. With respect to these critical accounting policies, we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. 
  Statements of Cash Flows  
  The following discussion explains the changes in   Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities  ,   Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities  , and   Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities   that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Operating Activities 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities   was   $179.3 million   compared to   $178.9 million   for the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved operating income, primarily driven by revenue growth at communities. 
  Investing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities   was   $(38.0) million   compared to   $(24.2) million   for the comparable period in   2015  . The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from dispositions, partially offset by decreased development of real estate assets and increased distributions received from unconsolidated entities.

Real Estate Under Development and Redevelopment 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership was redeveloping two communities, located in San Francisco, California and Newport Beach, California, both of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. The redevelopments include the renovation of building exteriors, corridors, and common area amenities as well as individual apartment homes. 
  Financing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our   Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities   was   $(144.4) million   compared to   $(155.1) million   for the comparable period of   2015  . The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an decrease in advances to the General Partner, partially offset by the payoff of maturing debt and the early payoff of debt maturing in May 2017.  
  Credit Facilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate commitment of   $408.5 million   of the General Partner's secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae was allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt. The entire commitment was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . The portions of the Fannie Mae credit facilities allocated to the Operating Partnership mature at various dates from   December 2018   through   July 2023   and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $244.9 million   of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of   5.05%   and the remaining balance of   $163.6 million   on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of   2.22%  .  
  The Operating Partnership is a guarantor on the General Partner s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of   $1.1 billion  ,   $300 million   of medium-term notes due   June 2018  ,   $300 million   of medium-term notes due   October 2020  , a   $350 million   term loan facility due   January 2021  ,   $400 million   of medium-term notes due   January 2022  ,   $300 million   of medium-term notes due   July 2024  ,   $300 million   of medium-term notes due   October 2025   and   $300 million   of medium-term notes due   September 2026  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility was   $180.0 million   and   $150.0 million  , respectively. 
  The credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations.

  As part of our General Partner s overall interest rate risk management strategy, our General Partner uses derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of variable rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. Our General Partner s derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management include interest rate swaps with indexes that relate to the pricing of specific debt instruments of our General Partner that are allocated to the Operating Partnership. The General Partner believes that we have appropriately controlled our interest rate risk through the use of derivative instruments (allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the General Partner s underlying debt instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership) to minimize any unintended effect on consolidated earnings. Derivative contracts did not have a material impact on the results of operations during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   (see Note 8,   Derivatives and Hedging Activity,   in the Notes to the Operating Partnership s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report). 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had   $190.6 million   in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . If market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   would increase by   $1.4 million   based on the average balance outstanding during the period. 
  These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to

     Table of Contents  

the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. 
  The General Partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. See Note 8,   Derivatives and Hedging Activities  , in the Notes to the Operating Partnership s Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivate instruments. 
   
  Results of Operations  
  The following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to OP Unitholders 
  Net income attributable to OP unitholders was   $11.5 million   (  $0.06   per diluted OP Unit) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to net income of   $14.6 million   (  $0.08   per diluted OP Unit) for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to OP unitholders resulted primarily from the following items, which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report: 
             
    a decrease of   $7.6 million   in total property NOI primarily due to fewer consolidated apartment homes as a result of the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership during 2015; and 
                
    losses from unconsolidated entities of   $9.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to none during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , as a result of the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
     This was partially offset by: 
             
    a decrease in real estate depreciation and amortization expense of   $6.9 million   primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership; and 
                
    a decrease in interest expense of   $3.5 million   primarily due to the deconsolidation of debt balances related to communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership. 
     Net income attributable to OP unitholders was   $27.3 million   (  $0.15   per diluted OP Unit) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to net income of   $98.3 million   (  $0.54   per diluted OP Unit) for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to OP unitholders resulted primarily from the following items, which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report: 
             
    a decrease of   $20.8 million   in total property NOI primarily primarily due to fewer consolidated apartment homes as a result of the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership during 2015; 
                
    no sales of real estate owned during the the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to a gain on the sale of real estate owned of   $57.0 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  ; and 
                
    losses from unconsolidated entities of   $32.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
     This was partially offset by: 
             
    a decrease in real estate depreciation and amortization expense of   $21.6 million   primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership; and 
                
    a decrease in interest expense of   $10.0 million   primarily due to the deconsolidation of debt balances related to communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership.

Apartment Community Operations 
  Our net income results primarily from NOI generated from the operation of our apartment communities. The Operating Partnership defines NOI, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent.  
  The following table summarizes the operating performance of our total portfolio for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015     (dollars in thousands)  : 

(a) 
    Same-Store Community   population consisted of   14,001   apartment homes.  
              (b) 
    Same-Store Community   population consisted of   14,001   apartment homes.  
              (c) 
    Excludes depreciation, amortization, and property management expenses.

The following table is our reconciliation of total property NOI to   Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders     for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015     (dollars in thousands)  : 

Same-Store Communities 
  Our   Same-Store Community   properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to   July 1, 2015   for quarter-to-date comparison and   January 1, 2015   for year-to-date comparison and held as of   September 30, 2016  ) consisted of   14,001   apartment homes for both periods and provided   79.9%   of our total NOI for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  NOI for our   Same-Store Community   properties   increase  d   7.3%   or   $4.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in property NOI was primarily attributable to a 6.3% or $4.8 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 3.7% or $0.8 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 6.2% or $4.5 million increase in rental rates. Physical occupancy increased 0.2% to 96.9% and total income per occupied home increased 6.1% to $2,010 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 12.4% or $0.8 million increase in real estate taxes and a 7.3% or $0.1 million increase in general and administrative expense compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income)   increase  d to   73.0%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   72.3%   for the comparable period in   2015  .  
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  NOI for our   Same-Store Community   properties   increase  d   7.9%   or   $12.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in property NOI was primarily attributable to a 6.9% or $15.5 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 4.2% or $2.6 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 7.2% or $15.2 million increase in rental rates. Physical occupancy decreased 0.2% to 96.6% and total income per occupied home increased 7.1% to $1,980 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 9.2% or $1.8 million increase in real estate taxes, a 9.0% or $0.3 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 2.3% or $0.2 million increase in utilities expense compared to the same period in   2015  .

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income)   increase  d to   73.6%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   72.9%   for the comparable period in   2015  .  
  Non-Mature Communities/Other 
  The Operating Partnership s   Non-Mature Communities/Other   represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in   Same-Store Communities  , including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.  
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The remaining   20.1%   or   $15.0 million   of our total NOI during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was generated from our   Non-Mature Communities  . NOI from   Non-Mature Communities     decrease  d   43.7%   or   $11.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily driven by a   decrease   in NOI of   $13.3 million   from sold and held for sale communities, which was partially offset by an   increase   in NOI from acquired communities of   $1.7 million   and an   increase   in NOI from developed properties of   $0.4 million  . 
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The remaining   20.1%   or   $44.5 million   of our total NOI during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was generated from our   Non-Mature Communities  . NOI from   Non-Mature Communities     decrease  d   43.1%   or   $33.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily driven by a   decrease   in NOI of   $40.9 million   from sold and held for sale communities, which was partially offset by an   increase   in NOI from acquired communities of   $5.4 million   and an   increase   in NOI from developed properties of   $1.8 million  . 
  Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , real estate depreciation and amortization   decrease  d by   15.8%   or   $6.9 million   and   16.3%   or   $21.6 million  , respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership during 2015, partially offset by homes delivered from our development and redevelopment properties.  
  General and Administrative 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expense   decrease  d by   41.6%   or   $3.3 million   and   32.6%   or   $6.7 million  , respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership during 2015. 
  Income/(Loss) in Unconsolidated Entities 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities of   $(9.5) million   and   $(32.9) million  , respectively, was attributable to the Operating Partnership's ownership interest in the DownREIT Partnership, which was formed in the fourth quarter of   2015  . The Operating Partnership did not hold any ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest Expense  
    
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , interest expense   decrease  d by   31.7%   or   $3.5 million   and   30.6%   or   $10.0 million  , respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in   2015  . The   decrease   in interest expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower loan balances as a result of seven communities, and their related debt, being deconsolidated in 2015 in connection with the formation of the DownREIT Partnership. 
    
  Gain/(Loss) on Sale of Real Estate Owned 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership did not have any sales of consolidated real estate owned. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Operating Partnership recognized a gain of $32.4 million on the sale of one community in Beaverton, Oregon and recognized a gain of $24.6 million, which was previously deferred, in connection with the sale of the communities held by the Texas Joint Venture.

Inflation 
  We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.

Item 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The Company and the Operating Partnership are exposed to interest rate changes associated with our unsecured credit facility and other variable rate debt as well as refinancing risk on our fixed rate debt. The Company s and the Operating Partnership s involvement with derivative financial instruments is limited and we do not expect to use them for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company and the Operating Partnership use derivative instruments solely to manage their exposure to interest rates. 
  See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   under the heading  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  for a more complete discussion of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , our market risk has not changed materially from the amounts reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  The disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. As a result, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such disclosure controls and procedures will meet their objectives. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Company, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Company concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership are effective at the reasonable assurance level described above. 
  There have not been any changes in either the Company s or the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the   third   fiscal quarter to which this report relates that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of either the Company or the Operating Partnership.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  The Company is a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the results of any such claims and litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  There are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and the Operating Partnership. The following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. 
  Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our Operations 
  Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value of Our Real Estate Assets.   Unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to UDR s stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: 
             
    downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; 
                
    declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; 
                
    government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; 
                
    local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; 
                
    declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; 
                
    changes in market rental rates; 
                
    our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; 
                
    the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; 
                
    declines in household formation; and 
                
    rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs.

We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Apartment Units as Leases Expire.   When our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. Even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. 
  Substantial International, National and Local Government Spending and Increasing Deficits May Adversely Impact Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   The values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. As a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. These increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Risk of Inflation/Deflation.   Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. The general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to UDR s stockholders. The predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties.  
  We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and Financial Flexibility.   We periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:             
             
    a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the  Code,  so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and 
                
    federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. 
     Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain Rents.   Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
  We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Successfully Could Create Inefficiencies.   We have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:             
             
    we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; 
                
    even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition; 
     
   87 

     Table of Contents  

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; 
                
    we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; 
                
    when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;  
                
    the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and 
                
    we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. 
     Competition Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Acquire Properties.   In the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. 
  Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our Profitability.   In the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:             
             
    we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; 
                
    we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; 
                
    yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; 
                
    if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; 
                
    we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; 
                
    we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; 
                
    occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and 
                
    when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. 
     In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Bankruptcy or Defaults of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our Performance.   We have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. As a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties  ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
  Property Ownership Through Partnerships and Joint Ventures May Limit Our Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.   We have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. We currently have 16 active joint ventures and partnerships, including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investment, with a total equity investment of   $917.9 million  . We could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. In some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. Also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. In general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners  interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner s interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm s length marketing process. 
  We are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. 
  We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.   In connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. These agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. However, subject to certain conditions, we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers. 
    
  We Could Incur Significant Insurance Costs and Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by Insurance.   We have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. 
  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions. 
  As a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. Insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. We insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. The financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.   We have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. These risks include, among others: 
             
    inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; 
                
    inability to hire and retain key personnel; 
                
    lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and 
                
    inability to achieve budgeted financial results. 
     Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could Result in Substantial Costs.   Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. 
  In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. Changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. 
  As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. 
  These requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the environment. 
  We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our Properties May Contain or Develop Harmful Mold or Suffer from Other Indoor Air Quality Issues, Which Could Lead to Liability for Adverse Health Effects or Property Damage or Cost for Remediation.   When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. 
  Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and Requirements Could Result in Substantial Costs.   The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the  
  
   90 

     Table of Contents  

federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time, claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 
  Compliance with or Changes in Real Estate Tax and Other Laws Could Adversely Affect Our Funds from Operations and Our Ability to Make Distributions to Stockholders.   Generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. These costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
  Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather and Natural Events and Potential Climate Change.   Certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  To the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. Should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
  Risk of Earthquake Damage.   Some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. As a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management s view, economically impractical. 
  Risk of Accidental Death Due to Fire, Natural Disasters or Other Hazards.   The accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease the Value of Our Assets.   Actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Mezzanine Loan Assets Involve Greater Risks of Loss than Senior Loans Secured by Income-producing Properties.   We may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. Mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal.  
  We May Experience a Decline in the Fair Value of Our Assets and Be Forced to Recognize Impairment Charges, Which Could Materially and Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations and the Market Price of UDR     s Common Stock.   A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the United States ( GAAP ), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of UDR s common stock. 
  Any Material Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on UDR     s Stock Price.   Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on UDR s stock price. 
  Our Business and Operations Would Suffer in the Event of System Failures or Breaches in Data Security.   Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems  improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. 
  Our Success Depends on Our Senior Management.   Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We May be Adversely Affected by New Federal Laws and Regulations.   The United States Administration and Congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. We believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.

Federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession. These initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the United States at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the Great Depression. The federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on July 21, 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ). Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. The Dodd-Frank Act, including rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the United States Congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. 
  Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. We intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. 
  We May be Adversely Affected by New State and Local Laws and Regulations.   We are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. We cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business. 
  Changes in U.S. Accounting Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported Results of Operations.   Accounting for public companies in the United States is in accordance with GAAP, which is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the FASB and the SEC, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.  
  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings 
  Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.   We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy UDR s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to UDR s stockholders. 
  Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to Stockholders.   If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to UDR s stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: 
             
    the national and local economies; 
     
   93 

     Table of Contents  

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; 
                
    tenants  perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; 
                
    our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; 
                
    rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; 
                
    competition from other apartment communities; 
                
    changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; 
                
    changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and 
                
    changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing. 
     Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. 
  Our Debt Level May Be Increased.   Our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. 
  Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be Dilutive.   Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. 
  Failure To Maintain Our Current Credit Ratings Could Adversely Affect Our Cost of Funds, Related Margins, Liquidity, and Access to Capital Markets.   Moody s and Standard   Poor s, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. 
  Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact Availability and Cost of Credit and Have Other Adverse Effects on Us and the Market Price of UDR     s Stock.   Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. During the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the United States stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. Those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing. Any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of UDR s common stock. If we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of UDR s common or preferred stock.

A Change in U.S. Government Policy Regarding Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business.   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. We and other multifamily companies depend heavily on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. In September 2008, the U.S. government assumed control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the U.S. that could involve the phase out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While we believe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. Uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. 
  The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us.   We have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
  Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our Securities.   We currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , UDR had approximately   $657.6 million   of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately   18.5%   of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership had approximately   $190.6 million   of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately   43.8%   of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of UDR s common and preferred stock and debt securities. 
  Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May Result in Material Charges.   From time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. In addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Risks Related to Tax Laws 
    
  We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if UDR Failed to Qualify as a REIT.   UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely affect UDR s stockholders. 
    
  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to UDR s stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to UDR s stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to UDR s stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. 
  Certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as REITs under the Code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year. 
  Dividends Paid By REITs Generally Do Not Qualify for Reduced Tax Rates.   In general, the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual U.S. stockholders is 20%. Unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a REIT, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. 
  UDR May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax Risks.   We have established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite UDR s qualification as a REIT, its taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm s length in nature or are otherwise not respected. 
  REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available Cash.   As a REIT, UDR is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to UDR s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code. 
  Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain Attributable to the Transaction.   From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property

sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect UDR s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
  We Could Face Possible State and Local Tax Audits and Adverse Changes in State and Local Tax Laws.   As discussed in the risk factors above, because UDR is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to UDR s stockholders. In the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. If such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
  The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership Intend to Qualify as Partnerships, But Cannot Guarantee That They Will Qualify.   The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. If classified as  partnerships, the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. However, the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were  publicly traded partnerships,  unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the Code. A  publicly traded partnership  is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). Although neither the Operating Partnership s nor the DownREIT Partnership s partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the Operating Partnership s and DownREIT Partnership s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may not qualify for one of the  safe harbors  under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. If the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, they would incur substantial tax liabilities, and UDR would then fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. 
    
  Qualifying as a REIT Involves Highly Technical and Complex Provisions of the Code.   Our qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the REIT income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
    
  Risks Related to Our Organization and Ownership of UDR s Stock 
    
  Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of UDR     s Common Stock.   The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ), on which we list UDR s common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of UDR s common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in UDR s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition to the risks listed in this  Risk Factors  section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of UDR s common stock, including: 

general market and economic conditions; 
     
   97 

     Table of Contents  

actual or anticipated variations in UDR s quarterly operating results or dividends or UDR s payment of dividends in shares of UDR s stock; 
                
    changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; 
                
    difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; 
                
    decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; 
                
    changes in market valuations of similar companies; 
                
    publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; 
                
    the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); 
                
    general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of UDR s stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; 
                
    a change in analyst ratings; 
                
    additions or departures of key management personnel; 
                
    adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; 
                
    speculation in the press or investment community; 
                
    terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which UDR s securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; 
                
    failure to qualify as a REIT; 
                
    strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; 
                
    failure to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE; 
                
    governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and 
                
    the issuance of additional shares of UDR s common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under UDR s at-the-market equity distribution program. 
     Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of UDR s common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. 
  We May Change the Dividend Policy for UDR     s Common Stock in the Future.   The decision to declare and pay dividends on UDR s common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of UDR s common stock. 
  Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in UDR     s Stockholders      Best Interests.   Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in UDR s stockholders  best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of UDR s stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors  prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders  
  
   98 

     Table of Contents  

representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. 
  Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability of UDR     s Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company Restricts the Transferability of UDR     s Stock and May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to UDR     s Stockholders.   One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to UDR s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. Absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of UDR s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for UDR s stockholders or might otherwise be in UDR s stockholders  best interests.

Item 2.        UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  From time to time the Company issues shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for operating partnership units ( OP Units ) tendered to the Operating Partnership for redemption in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Partnership s limited partnership agreement. The holders of OP Units have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of their OP Units in exchange for a cash payment based on the market value of our common stock at the time of redemption. However, the Operating Partnership s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the prior right of the Company to acquire such OP Units in exchange for either the cash amount or the number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to the number of OP Units being redeemed.  
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not issue any shares of our common stock upon redemption of OP Units.  
  Repurchase of Equity Securities 
  In February 2006, UDR s Board of Directors authorized a 10 million share repurchase program. In January 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a new 15 million share repurchase program. Under the two share repurchase programs, UDR may repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases, block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. As reflected in the table below, no shares of common stock were repurchased under these programs during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

UDR, INC., a Maryland corporation (the  Company , which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE   Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount of THREE-HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($300,000,000), on the Stated Maturity Date specified above (or any Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined on the reverse hereof, or any earlier date of acceleration of maturity) (each such date being hereinafter referred to as the  Maturity Date  with respect to the principal repayable on such date) and to pay interest thereon (and on any overdue principal, premium and/or interest to the extent legally enforceable) at the Interest Rate per annum specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.  The Company will pay interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above (each, an  Interest Payment Date ), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Maturity Date;   provided  ,   however  , that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest payment will commence on the Interest Payment Date immediately following the next succeeding Record Date to the registered holder (the  Holder ) of this Note on the next succeeding Record Date.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 
  United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the  Guarantee ). The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity. The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.  
  Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an  Interest Period ).  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes, as defined on the reverse hereof) is registered at the close of business on the February 15 or August 15 (whether or not a Business Day, as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (the  Record Date    provided  ,   however  , that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon shall be payable.  Any such interest not  
  
   3 

so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date ( Defaulted Interest ) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the close of business on any Record Date and, instead, shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the  Special Record Date ) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture. 
  Payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date will be made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note (and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, upon delivery of instructions as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, currently the corporate trust office of the Trustee located at 40 Broad Street, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10004, or at such other paying agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as the Company may determine;   provided  ,   however  , that if the Specified Currency (as defined below) is other than United States dollars and such payment is to be made in the Specified Currency in accordance with the provisions set forth below, such payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated by the Holder hereof at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note is presented and surrendered and, if applicable, instructions are delivered at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company in time for the Trustee to make such payment in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date will be made at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register maintained by the Trustee;   provided  ,   however  , that a Holder of U.S.$10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds if such Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 calendar days prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder. 
  If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. 
  As used herein,  Business Day  means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York;   provided  ,   however  , that if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, such day must also not be a day on which  
  
   4 

commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is Euro, such day must also be a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open).   Principal Financial Center  means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency, except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, South African rands and Swiss francs, the  Principal Financial Center  shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Toronto, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively. 
  The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note in the currency in which this Note is denominated above (or, if such currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such currency or, if such currency is Euro, in the member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, then the currency which is at the time of such payment legal tender in the related country or in the adopting member states of the European Union, as the case may be) (the  Specified Currency ).  If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, except as otherwise provided below, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into United States dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note.  
  Any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for United States dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Notes scheduled to receive United States dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified Currency. 
  If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its corporate trust office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice delivered to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. 
  
   5 

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars and the Holder of this Note shall have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, but the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate.  The  Market Exchange Rate  for the Specified Currency other than United States dollars means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture). 
  All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note. 
  The Company agrees to indemnify the Holder of any Note against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order requiring payment in a currency (the  Judgment Currency ) other than the Specified Currency, and as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Specified Currency amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which such Holder, on the date of payment of such judgment or order, is able to purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such Holder, as the case may be.  The foregoing indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Company and continues in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.  The term  rate of exchange  includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency. 
  Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified on the face hereof, in an Addendum hereto, which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on the face hereof. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or  Other/Additional Provisions  apply to this Note as specified above, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such  Other/Additional Provisions . 
  Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

[REVERSE OF NOTE] 
  UDR, INC. 
  MEDIUM TERM NOTE,     SERIES A 
  DUE NINE MONTHS OR MORE FROM DATE OF ISSUE, FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P. 
   (Fixed Rate) 
  This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the  Debt Securities ) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1995, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture thereto, dated as of May 3, 2011, as further amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the  Indenture ), between the Company (successor by merger to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., a Virginia corporation) and U.S. Bank National Association, successor trustee to Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly known as First Union National Bank of Virginia), as trustee (the  Trustee , which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as  Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue, Fully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by United Dominion Realty, L.P.  (the  Notes ).  All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be. 
  United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the  Guarantee ). The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity. The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.  
  This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the face hereof. 
  
   8 

This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date. 
  This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the  Redemption Date ), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date.  The  Redemption Price  shall be an amount equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption Percentage, if any, shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof. 
  This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the  Repayment Date ).  For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and instructions to such effect forwarded by the Holder hereof.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof. 
  If this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be.  The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the  Discount . 
  
   9 

For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant.  The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated.  If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the  Initial Period ) is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued.  If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence. 
  The covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture shall not apply to this Note, and the following covenants shall instead apply to this Note in place of the covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture: 
   The Trust will, and will cause the Subsidiaries to, have at all times Total Unencumbered Assets of not less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Trust s outstanding Unsecured Debt and the outstanding Unsecured Debt of the Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.  
  The Trust will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, incur any Debt if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt of the Trust and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis determined in accordance with GAAP is greater than 65% of the sum of (without duplication) (i) the Trust s Total Assets as of the end of the calendar quarter covered in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Debt and (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Trust or any Subsidiary since the end of such calendar quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Debt.  
   Total Unencumbered Assets  means the sum of, without duplication, those Undepreciated Real Estate Assets which are not subject to a lien securing Debt and all other assets, excluding accounts receivable and intangibles, of the Trust and the Subsidiaries not subject to a lien securing Debt, all determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that all investments by the Trust and the Subsidiaries in unconsolidated joint ventures, unconsolidated limited partnerships, unconsolidated limited liability  
  
   10 

companies and other unconsolidated entities shall be excluded from Total Unencumbered Assets to the extent that such investments would have otherwise been included.  
  If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may, and in certain cases shall, be accelerated in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 
  The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes. 
  The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all such Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 
  No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 
  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes having the same terms and provisions, of Authorized Denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued by the Company to the designated transferee or transferees. 
  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different Authorized Denominations but otherwise having the same terms and provisions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the same. 
  
   11 

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 
  Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary, except as required by law. 
  THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.

  ADDENDUM TO MEDIUM-TERM NOTE  (Fixed Rate) 
  The Company may redeem all or part of this Note at any time at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) the principal amount of this Note being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date or (2) the Make-Whole Amount for the principal amount of this Note being redeemed.  If this Note is redeemed on or after June 1, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date), the redemption price will equal the principal amount of this Note being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
