NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the three month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015

(unaudited)

1. 
 
 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

PhotoAmigo, Inc. ("the Company" or "PhotoAmigo") was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008. The Company has been in the development stage since its formation and has not yet realized revenues from its planned operations. It plans to develop photographic sharing and networking through its website PhotoAmigo.com.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Interim Financial Information:  The interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as promulgated in Item 210 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position as of October 31, 2016, results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the three and Three month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K.

Development Stage Company:  The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and among the additional disclosures required as a development stage company are that its financial statements were identified as those of a development stage company, and that the statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows disclosed activity since the date of its Inception (April 2, 2008) as a development stage company Although the Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business.  All losses accumulated since Inception (April 2, 2008) have been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities.  Effective June 10, 2014 FASB changed its regulations with respect to Development Stage Entities and these additional disclosures are no longer required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 with the option for entities to early adopt these new provisions. The Company has adopted these provisions and consequently these additional disclosures are not included in these financial statements.

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the identification and disclosure of impaired assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

7 

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The majority of cash is maintained with a major financial institution in the United States.   Generally, these deposits may be redeemed on demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Income Taxes:  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

Revenue Recognition:  PhotoAmigo has not commenced operations, is in its development stage, and has not yet generated any revenues from operations. Revenues are expected to be derived principally from subscriptions to our website.

Income (Loss) Per Share:  Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (or loss) by the weighted- average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company, assuming the issuance of an equivalent number of common shares pursuant to options, warrants, or convertible debt arrangements. Diluted earnings per share is not shown for periods in which the Company incurs a loss because it would be anti-dilutive. Similarly, potential common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation if the effect would be anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity securities were issued or outstanding during the three and Three month periods ended October 31, 2016 or 2015.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:  The Company has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company..

2. 
 
 Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of obligations in the normal course of business. However, PhotoAmigo's operations are in the development stage and it has incurred losses since inception (April 2, 2008), resulting in an accumulated deficit of $289,519 as of October 31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of PhotoAmigo to continue as a going concern.

In view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to PhotoAmigo, and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management cannot provide assurance that PhotoAmigo will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of PhotoAmigo to continue as a going concern.

3. 
 
 Related Party Transactions

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Company borrowed $6,937 from three shareholders: $2,500 from two shareholders and $1,937 from a third shareholder for a total of $6,937 to fund the Company's ongoing activities. The shareholders have not received any equity for these contributions and these contributions are repayable by the Company. Simple interest accrues on these notes at 2% annually. Principle and interest are due upon sale or merger of the Company or upon demand. The Company has accrued an interest expense of $14 for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 related to these notes.

Office space is provided to PhotoAmigo at no additional cost by the sole executive officer. No provision for these costs has been included in these financial statements as the amounts are not material.

4. 
 
 Income Taxes

PhotoAmigo's deferred tax assets, valuation allowance, and change in valuation allowance are as follows:

9 

Income taxes at the statutory rate are reconciled to reported income tax expense (benefit) as follows:

At this time, the Company is unable to determine if it will be able to benefit from its deferred tax asset. There are limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, including a requirement that losses be offset against future taxable income, if any. In addition, there are limitations imposed by certain transactions which are deemed to be ownership changes. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for the entire deferred tax asset.

5.  Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. No shares of preferred stock have been issued or outstanding since Inception (April 1, 2008).

Common Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares or common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.

No shares of common stock were issued during the three months ended October 31, 2016 or 2015.

There were 3,018,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at October 31, 2016.

Additional Paid In Capital

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, the shareholders didn't contribute to additional paid in capital compared to $5,000 during the quarter ending October 31, 2015 to fund the Company's ongoing activities.

6.      Subsequent Events 

In accordance with ASC 855 , "Subsequent Events" , the Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of these unaudited financial statements and has determined that it did not have any material recognizable subsequent events to report.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation Overview

This discussion updates our business plan for the three month period ending October 31, 2016. It also analyzes our financial condition at October 31, 2016, and compares it to our financial condition at July 31, 2016. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2016, including footnotes, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and with the unaudited financial statements for the interim period ended October 31, 2016, including footnotes, which are included in this quarterly report.

Overview

PhotoAmigo, Inc. ("the Company", "PhotoAmigo", "we", "us" or "our") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 ("Inception"). Since Inception, we have engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan which is to develop photographic sharing and networking through its website PhotoAmigo.com

Ability to continue as a "going concern ". The independent registered public accounting firm's reports on our financial statements as of July 31, 2015 and 2015, includes a "going concern" explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to the factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed in the financial statements, including footnotes thereto.

Development Stage Company.  We are considered to be in the development stage as defined in the accounting standards. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to business planning and development. Additionally, we have allocated a substantial portion of our time and investment to bringing our product to the market, and to raising capital. We have not yet generated any revenue from operations.

Plan of Operation

We provide social networking and photo sharing from our website PhotoAmigo.com. We also maintain the domain names PhotoAmigo.net, fotoamigo.com and fotoamigo.net. These domain names all redirect incoming traffic to our main website, PhotoAmigo.com.

We need to continue development of the features on the website and attract additional subscribers. PhotoAmigo believes that its brand, product offering and future enhancements will continue to attract users and will make it a premier destination for photo sharing. While there are established photo sharing sites on the Internet, we believe that the continued growth of sharing photos and photo blogging will create an opportunity for additional sites. Our strategy is to engage users by offering free photo sharing and social networking services. We believe that by offering a full suite of services for free, we can eventually get users to upgrade their membership for more photo sharing storage space.

11

To become a viable enterprise, we must further increase the number of members visiting out site and convert members from free membership to paid membership.

We are unable, at this time, to predict when, if ever, our objectives will be achieved.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of October 31, 2016, we had working capital of $(4,616), comprised of $4,914 in cash and $9,530 of current liabilities.  This represents a decrease in the working capital of $1,854 from the working capital balance of     $(2,761) reported as of July 31, 2016 which comprised cash of $359 and current liabilities, comprising accounts payable of $3,120.

Our lack of capital resources will require us to obtain additional funding to achieve our photo sharing website development goals. In the past we have relied on issuances of common stock to fund our operations.

We may seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any needed financing on favorable terms, or at all, or that we will find qualified purchasers for the sale of our stock. Any sales of our securities would dilute the ownership of our existing investors.

We currently have no written or firm agreement regarding future funding requirements, and we may curtail our efforts or cease activities entirely.

Future Capital Expenditures

As of October 31, 2016, we have no plans or commitments to acquire capital assets.

12 

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended October 31, 2015

Revenue

We recognized no revenue in the three months ended October 31, 2016 or 2015 as our limited operations have not generated revenue yet.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses decreased to $2,076 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, compared to $7,839 during the comparable period of 2015. During the three months ended October 31, 2016, website development costs decreased by $97, depreciation was the same and legal and accounting fees decreased by $113, while investor relations increased by $349, and general and administrative expenses decreased $5,902 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015. Consistent with our current need to conserve capital resources, we try to reduce our marketing expenses, and certain general and administrative expenses but do not always succeed. Substantially all of our operating expenses are incurred in connection with activities to meet current reporting requirements for a public company and there was no material change in the nature or extent of those activities.

Net Loss

For the three months ended October 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $2,090 compared to a net loss for the corresponding period of 2015 of $7,839 or a decrease in losses of $5,749 due to the factors discussed above.

13 

Cash Flows   Three Months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended October 31, 2015

Operating Activities

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 we used $2,383 in operating activities compared to the $7,346 used in the operations during the three months ended October 31, 2015. During the three months ended October 31, 2016, we recorded losses of $2,090, incurred non cash depreciation of $235 and accounts payable decreased by $542. By comparison, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, we recorded losses of $7,839, incurred non-cash depreciation of $235, and accounts payable decreased by $(542).

Investing activities

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 we did not purchase any capital assets, we neither used, nor generated funds from investing activities.

Financing activities

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, two shareholders loaned the Company $2,500 and a third shareholder loaned $1,937 for a total of $6,937 to finance the Company's ongoing activities. The shareholders did not receive any equity for these loans and they are repayable by the Company. Accordingly, these funds have been accounted for as loans. For the period ending October 31, 2015 we received $5,000 of additional paid in capital contributions from 3 of the shareholders.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of the footnotes to our unaudited financial statements above. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies since our most recent audit dated July 31, 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-Q contains or incorporates by reference "forward-looking statements," as that term is used in federal securities laws, about our financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements include, among others:

- 
 
 statements concerning the benefits that we expect will result from our business activities and results of business development that we contemplate or have completed, such as increased revenues; and statements of our expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts. These statements may be made expressly in this document or may be incorporated by reference to other documents that we will file with the SEC. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions used in this report or incorporated by reference in this report.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied in those statements. Because the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. We caution you not to put undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Further, the information contained in this document or incorporated herein by reference is a statement of our present intention and is based on present facts and assumptions, and may change at any time and without notice, based on changes in such facts or assumptions.

14 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was performed under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms due to material weaknesses in our internal controls described below.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a- 15(f). Our internal control system is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements and that we have controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we will be required to file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely and informed decisions regarding financial disclosure. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of October 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria.

Management's assessment identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses include the following:

Limited capability to interpret and apply accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; Lack of formal accounting policies and procedures that include multiple levels of review. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our control systems are designed to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

This report does not include an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 240.13a-15 or Rule 240.15d-15 of this chapter that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

No changes made to internal controls during three months ended October 31, 2016.
