Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking
statements.   

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects, 
 plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential, 
 proposed,   intended,  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating
results or our future financial condition or state other  forward-looking  information. There may be events in the
future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the
occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations
and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline
and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these
statements to actual results.

1. Basis of Presentation and Liquidity  

The accompanying interim condensed financial
statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management of Reed s, Inc. (the  Company ), contain all adjustments,
which include normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2016 and the results
of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is
derived from the Company s audited financial statements. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, although management of the Company believes that the disclosures contained in these condensed financial statements
are adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading. For further information, refer to the financial statements
and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on March 23, 2016. 

The results of operations for the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year ending
December 31, 2016. 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts, inventory obsolescence, analysis of impairments
of recorded intangibles, accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services. 

Liquidity  

As of September 30, 2016, we had stockholders
equity of $972,000 and working capital of $274,000 compared to stockholders equity of $785,000 and working capital of $730,000
at December 31, 2015. 

We believe that the Company currently has the
necessary working capital to support existing operations until our line of credit and all of the long term loans become due on
October 1, 2017. Consistent with past refinancing practices regarding the Line of Credit, the Company believes that it will be
successful in renewing the Line of Credit for another time frame similar to what it has done in the past. There are no assurances
that this refinancing will be completed. We believe our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations. If our
sales goals do not materialize as planned, we believe that the Company can reduce its operating costs and can be managed to maintain
positive cash flow from operations. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations
and a line of credit from a financial institution. Additionally, we have done private sales of common stock to fund operations. 

We may not generate sufficient revenues from
product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations. If we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point
in the future, we eventually may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct
them or to fund our expansion and marketing and product development plans. In addition, our losses may increase in the future as
we expand our manufacturing capabilities and fund our marketing plans and product development. These losses, among other things,
have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders  equity. If we
are unable to achieve profitability, the market value of our common stock would decline and there would be a material adverse effect
on our financial condition. 

If we suffer losses from operations, our working
capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any
time, unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing
on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able
to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations, including reducing infrastructure, promotions,
personnel and other operating expenses. These events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund the growth of our operations,
take advantage of opportunities, develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly
limited. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies  

Income (loss) per common share  

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stock holders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all
dilutive potential common shares had been issued, using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the
computation when their effect is antidilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the calculations
of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

The Company had potentially dilutive securities
that consisted of: 

Use of estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts, inventory obsolescence, depreciable lives
of property and equipment, analysis of impairments of recorded intangibles, accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions
made in valuing stock instruments issued for services. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will
eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle
based approach for determining revenue recognition. On August 12, 2015, FASB delayed the required implementation to fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2017 but now permitted organizations such a Reeds to adopt earlier. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies
recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require
additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts,
including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15
provides guidance as to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements
for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Management s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that
are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists
when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to
meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to
be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods
thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial statement presentation
and disclosures after the effective date. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding
lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition
approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is in the process
of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities
and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future
consolidated financial statements. 

Concentrations  

The Company s cash balances on deposit
with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company may be exposed to risk for the
amounts of funds held in one bank in excess of the insurance limit. In assessing the risk, the Company s policy is to maintain
cash balances with high quality financial institutions. The Company had cash balances in excess of $250,000 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had two customers that accounted for 24% and 13% of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the
Company had two customers that accounted for 29% and 12% of sales respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of
sales in either period. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had two customers that accounted
for 22% and 19% of sales in 2016, and two customers that accounted for 24% and 9% of sales in 2015, respectively. No other customers
accounted for more than 10% of sales in either period. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had accounts
receivable due from two customers who comprised 29% and 11% of its total accounts receivable and as of December 31, 2015 the Company
had accounts receivable due from two customers who comprised 24% and 12% of its total accounts receivable. No other customer accounted
for more than 10% of accounts receivable in the periods. 

During the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016, the Company had one vendor who accounted for 24% of all purchases and in the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015, one vendor
accounted for 26% of all purchases. No other vendor accounted for more than 10% of all purchases in either period. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had one vendor, which accounted for 21% of total accounts payable and as of December 31, 2015, the Company
had two vendors, which accounted for 11% and 10% of total accounts payable. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company uses various inputs in determining
the fair value of its investments and measures these assets on a recurring basis. Financial assets recorded at fair value in the
balance sheets are categorized by the level of objectivity associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Authoritative
guidance provided by the FASB defines the following levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs
to fair valuation of these financial assets: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2 Inputs, other than the quoted
prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on
the Company s assumptions. 

The Company had no such assets or liabilities
recorded to be valued on the basis above at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

The carrying amounts of financial assets and
liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term bank loans, accounts payable, notes payable and
other payables, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of capital
lease obligations and long-term financing obligations approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on
these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates. 

3. Inventory  

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out or market) and, net of reserves, is comprised of the following as of: 

4. Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are comprised of the
following as of: 

Depreciation expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $503,000 and $615,000 respectively. 

5. Notes Payable  

Line of Credit   

On November 9, 2011, the Company entered into
a Loan and Security Agreement with PMC Financial Services Group, LLC (PMC), which was amended and extended for two years on December
5, 2014, that provides a $6,000,000 revolving line of credit. The Amended Agreement extends and amends the Revolving Loan and Term
Loan (see discussion below) and adds a new Capital Expansion Loan (the  Capex Loan ) (see discussion below). At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount outstanding under the line of credit was $4,905,000 and $4,443,000 respectively. 

The revolving line of credit is based on 85%
of accounts receivable and 60% of eligible inventory and is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. The interest
rate on the Revolving Loan was the prime rate plus .35% (9% at September 30, 2016). However, the interest rate has been adjusted
as described below in term loans. The monthly management fee is .45% of the average monthly loan balance. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had a maximum borrowing availability of $946,000 under the line of credit agreement. 

On April 25, 2016, the Company agreed with
PMC to amend the definition of eligible inventory to include certain glass containers in exchange for 10,000 warrants. The total
value of the line did not increase and the inclusion of the glass as defined under the amendment will expire December 31, 2016.
In connection with the agreement, the Company granted PMC 10,000 warrants at an exercise price of $3.90 per share with a term of
five years and six months. The 10,000 warrants were valued at $15,000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were
recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 10,000 warrants; term of 5.5 years, volatility
of 56.35%, expected dividends of 0% and discount rate of 1.50%. The warrants value of $15,000 is being amortized over the 8 months
of the length of the time for the change to the eligible inventory definition. During the six months ending September 30, 2016,
$11,000 of valuation discount was amortized resulting in an unamortized balance of $4,000 at September 30, 2016. 

On May 13, 2016, PMC agreed to an extension
of the maturity date until October 1, 2017 for the line of credit that was to mature on December 5, 2016 as part of the restructuring
of all debt at PMC. See discussion of the consideration given PMC below under term loans. All other terms for the line of credit
remain the same. 

Term Loans   

The Company has the following term loans outstanding
with PMC Financial Services Corporation; 

In connection with the Loan and Security Agreement
with PMC, the Company entered into a Term Loan. The Term Loan was for $750,000, and was secured by all of the unencumbered assets
of the Company. Effective December 5, 2014 the Term Loan s outstanding principal balance was increased to $1,500,000 and
the annual interest rate was revised to prime plus 5.75% (currently 9%) subject to adjustment as described below. 

Effective September 1, 2015 the Company entered
into an additional Term Loan with a principal balance of $1,500,000 at prime plus 11.60% (currently 14.85%) with PMC. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount under the Term Loans outstanding was $3,000,000. 

The interest rate on the line of credit and
Term Loans described above are subject to adjustment as follows: 

The rate charge will be calculated on a sliding
scale based on the trailing 6 month EBITDA. If the EBITDA measuring point stays below $1,000,000 where it is now, the rate will
be 12%. If EBITDA rises to $1,500,000 then the rate will be reduced to 9%. 

Notwithstanding the other borrowing terms above,
if Excess Borrowing Availability under the $6 million Revolving line of credit remains more than $1,500,000 at all times during
the preceding month (currently Reed s Borrowing Availability is zero) the Interest Rate shall remain unchanged for the asset
based lending that includes the Revolving working capital loan, CAPEX capital improvement loan and Term Loan A. The six month Term
Loan B rates will remain the same at 14.85%. 

On November 9, 2015, the Company completed
a restructuring of the Term Loans with PMC. The aggregated amount of the principal for affected term loans is $3,000,000. Under
the new agreement, the maturity of both loans was to be due in lump sum on April 1, 2017 under the same rates and conditions as
before. In connection with the agreement, the Company granted PMC 125,000 warrants at an exercise price of $4.50 per share with
a term of five years and six months. The 125,000 warrants were valued at $141,000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing
model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 125,000 warrants; term of 5.5
years, volatility of 56.04%, expected dividends of 0% and discount rate of 0.68%. The warrants value of $141,000 is being amortized
over the remainder of the term loans. 

On May 13, 2016, the Company agreed with PMC
to extend the loan maturity date to October 1, 2017 for all loans outstanding at PMC under the same rates and conditions as before.
In connection with the agreement, the Company granted PMC 50,000 warrants at an exercise price of $4.50 per share with a term of
five years and six months. The 50,000 warrants were valued at $38,000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were
recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 50,000 warrants; term of 5.5 years, volatility
of 54.17%, expected dividends of 0% and discount rate of 1.49%. The warrants value of $38,000 is being amortized over the 16 months
until the maturity date of all loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $91,000 of valuation discount was amortized
resulting in an unamortized balance of $79,000 at September 30, 2016. 

Capital Expansion ( CAPEX ) Loan   

In connection with the loan and security agreement
with PMC, the Company entered into a CAPEX loan in the aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $3,000,000. The CAPEX loan will
finance new asset purchases for modernization and improvement of the beverage bottling equipment in the Los Angeles plant. Interest
only on the CAPEX loan shall be paid from time to time until the end of each fiscal quarter, at which time the principal amounts
of each outstanding CAPEX loan will be aggregated and repaid in 48 equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued but unpaid
interest beginning July 31, 2016, or if earlier, the revolver maturity of October 1, 2017. The maximum amount that can be borrowed
under the CAPEX loan was increased to $3,210,000 on May 13, 2016. The interest rate on the CAPEX loan is the prime rate plus 5.75%
(7% at September 30, 2016). At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance on the CAPEX loan balance was $3,022,000 and
$1,883,000 respectively. On September 30, 2016, the loan funding closed and the Company began repayments in July, 2016. 

In conjunction with this loan the Company has
placed equipment with a cost of $341,000 at a co-packing facility to enable the co-packer to manufacture our products. Should the
Company be unable to secure access to the equipment in the event of failure of the co-packer, the amount will become due and payable
by the Company immediately. 

The Company has the following capital expansion
loan outstanding with PMC Financial Services Corporation; 

6. Obligations under Capital Leases   

The Company leases equipment for its brewery
operations with an aggregate value of $943,000 under twelve non-cancelable capital leases. Most of the leases are personally guaranteed
by the Company s chief executive officer. Monthly payments range from $341 to $10,441 per month, including interest, at interest
rates ranging from 6.51% to 17.31% per annum. At September 30, 2016, monthly payments under these leases aggregated to $16,000.
The leases expire at various dates through 2020. 

Future minimum lease payments under capital leases are as follows: 

7. Long-term Financing Obligation   

On June 15, 2009, the Company closed escrow
on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered into a long-term lease agreement for the same
property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase the buildings and brewery equipment
from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of the fair market value or an agreed upon
amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms, the Company determined it had continuing involvement
that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore, the transaction has been accounted for as a long-term financing. The
proceeds from the sale, net of transaction costs, have been recorded as a financing obligation in the amount of $3,056,000. Monthly
payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in the financing obligation at an implicit
rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150,000 by the principal shareholder and Chief
Executive Officer, Christopher J. Reed. 

In connection with the financing obligation,
the Company issued an aggregate of 400,000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $1.20 per share for five years. The 400,000
warrants were valued at $752,000 and reflected as a debt discount, using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following
assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400,000 warrants: strike price of $2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility of 91.36%
to 110.9%; expected dividends of 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The 400,000 warrants were recorded as valuation discount
and are being amortized over 15 years, the term of the purchase option. 

Effective October 1, 2014, the Company executed
Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150,000 personal guarantee by the principal
shareholder and Chief Executive Office, and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral for the lease agreement, the
Company issued 200,000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share with a term of five years. The 200,000 warrants
were valued at $584,000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following
assumptions were made in valuing the 200,000 warrants; term of 5 years, volatility of 59.53%, expected dividends of 0% and discount
rate of 1.25%. The warrants value of $584,000 is being amortized over the remaining term of the purchase option. Amortization of
valuation discount was $83,000 and $68,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Long term financing obligation is comprised
of the following as of: 

8. Stockholders  Equity  

Common Stock   

On June 2, 2016, the Company entered into a
securities purchase agreement with institutional investors in a private financing transaction for the issuance and sale of 692,412
shares of the Company s common stock and warrants to purchase 346,206 shares of common stock. The net proceeds to the Company
from the offering were $2,113,000 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. The investor warrants
have an exercise price of $4.25 per share and a term of 5 years. As per the terms of the offering, the placement agent received
72,703 warrants and a term of 5 years at an exercise price of $3.74. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company sold 30,000 shares of its common stock to certain officers of the Company at $3.90 per share with total proceeds
of $117,000. 

Stock Options   

Stock options granted under our equity incentive
plans generally vest over 3 years from the date of grant, at 33% per year or over 4 years at 25% per year and expire 5 years from
the date of grant. The following table summarizes stock option activity for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016: 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase 2,500 shares at $2.50 for consulting services with a fair value
of $4,000. The fair value was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: (i) volatility
rate of 73%, (ii) discount rate between of 1.64%, (iii) zero expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected term of 5 years based upon
the average of the term of the option and the vesting period. 

The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated
as the difference between the closing market price, which was $3.74, and the exercise price of the Company s stock options
as of September 30, 2016. Stock-based compensation recognized on the Company s statement of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $449,000 and $715,000, respectively and is included in the selling and marketing and general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued 7,211 shares of the Company s common stock upon exercise of 15,000 stock options on a cashless basis. 

Stock Warrants   

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, 16,260 warrants were exercised into 16,260 shares of common stock for $45,000. 

The intrinsic value was calculated as the difference
between the closing market price, which was $3.74 and the exercise price of the Company s warrants common stock, as of September
30, 2016. There was no intrinsic value for warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2016, based on the fair value of the Company s
common stock on September 30, 2016. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes
appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions about
our future business.   

Overview  

The results for our third quarter of 2016 reflect
our operations continuing to meet demand, margins improving and significant cost containment. Our Reed s craft soda products
gross sales grew sequentially in the third quarter over the first quarter by 2.4% and was led by growth in our Butterscotch Beer
craft soda that sequentially grew more than double versus second quarter which was double the first quarter gross sales. Butterscotch
Beer has now reached $595,000 in gross sales for the latest quarter. Private label gross sales grew 230% percent sequentially or
year over year driven by timing of shipments of a seasonal items and an increase in the order for the seasonal item. 

We have included below detailed information
on our products from a sales perspective that is based on year over year results with the associated cost of goods sold and production.
The year over year comparison reflects the impact of the supply chain disruption last year. As a direct consequence of the third
quarter 2015 interruption, sales volume grew in 2016 by 18.1% and net sales revenue is up 15.1%. The information is presented in
an industry standard of eight ounce serving equivalents for ease of comparison. 

We continue to work on upgrading our Los Angeles
plant facility with the goal of increasing its capacity. We believe that this will result in savings on transportation as well
as other benefits that include quicker delivery of our products, particularly to our west coast customers. Our capital equipment
outlay in the third quarter was $753,000 as additional line equipment was procured for installation. The Idle Plant cost decreased
$601,000 over the same period last year while we continued at full capacity in anticipation of the fourth quarter shut down of
the line for a two to three week installation of the purchased equipment. 

Driven by cost containment initiatives overall
expenses decreased 27.4% or $1,014,000 during the third quarter when compared to the same time period in 2015. Savings were realized
in each individual category. Delivery expenses decreased 33.5%, Selling expenses decreased 26.1% and General and Administrative
expenses decreased 21.4% versus the prior year third quarter. Interest expense grew 29.3% or $94,000 during the quarter versus
the prior year third quarter and reflects the additional borrowing incurred as a direct result of the supply chain disruption. 

Due to these sales volume, gross margin, and
cost containment improvements discussed above, the company had an operating income of $196,000 in the third quarter versus a loss
$2,144,00 the same quarter in the prior year. The net improvement is $2,340,000. 

Results of Operations  

The following table sets forth-key statistics
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

* Gross sales is used internally by management
as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance,
product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before
the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross
sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should
not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as
an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales
may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received
from certain customers.  

**   Although the expenditures described
in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with
GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar
items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company s
distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) reimbursements given to the Company s distributors
for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both
new and existing products; (ii) the Company s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for
in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iii) the Company s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other
fees given directly to retailers; (iv) incentives given to the Company s distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding
certain predetermined sales goals; and (v) discounted or free products. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates
an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales.
Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company s promotional allowance
programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business.
These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from
one week to one year.  

Three months ended September 30, 2016
Compared to three months ended September 30, 2015   

* Discounts and costs incurred that do not
relate to specific SKU s   

Sales  

Third quarter gross sales increased in 2016
to $13,529,000 from $11,983,000 during the same three month period in 2015. On an 8-ounce serving basis, gross sales decreased
$0.59 per 8 ounce serving or 4.4% year over year. Both Reed s Ginger Brew and Virgils  brands were up versus the prior
year period as and sequential sales of both core brands were up over the second quarter which were up over the first quarter. Our
other Reed s brands sales increase was led by our Butterscotch Beer craft soda. Private label growth was driven by a higher
percentage of craft soda over private label Kombucha. Reed s Kombucha continues to be a focal point of opportunity. 

Third quarter net sales increased in 2016 to
$12,329,000 from $10,713,000 in the same period in 2015. On an 8 ounce serving basis, net sales decreased $0.31 per 8 ounce serving
or 2.5% year over year. The main driver of the decrease was decreased promotional spending of $70,000 or 5.5% on a significantly
higher sales volume of 18.1%. Candy gross sales continue its recovery on a year over year basis late in the quarter from the California
lawsuit regarding specific sourcing locations. Candy sales were down $195,000 over the same period in 2015. Internet sales began
again the first week of October 2016. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Produced   

Cost of tangible goods sold consists of the
costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, inventory
adjustments and internal transfer costs. Idle capacity consists of direct production costs of our Los Angeles plant in excess of
charges allocated to our finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs, production supplies, repairs and maintenance,
and depreciation. Our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined on a market cost basis, which
is lower than our actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather
than added to the cost of finished goods produced. 

Third quarter cost of goods  sold  increased
in 2016 to $9,275,000 from $8,769,000 in the same period in 2015. On an 8 ounce serving basis, cost of goods  sold  decreased
$1.02 per 8 ounce serving or 10.4% year over year. The main driver of the dollar increase was volume increase of 18.1% on an 8
ounce basis. The main driver of the 8 ounce unit cost decrease was the improvement in costs allocated to specific SKUs of $1,888,000.
In 2015, this amount included write offs of accumulated unusable inventory directly impacted by the supply chain interruption. 

Third quarter cost of goods  produced 
increased in 2016 to $9,443,000 from $9,153,000 in the same period in 2015 due to volume increases. On an 8 ounce serving volume
basis, cost of goods  produced  decreased $1.29 per 8 ounce serving or 12.6% year over year. The main driver of the decrease
is the costs unallocated to specific SKUs discussed above and continued improvement in idle plant costs of $216,000 in the same
quarter as compared to prior year same quarter. 

Gross Margin  

Third quarter gross margin improved to 23.4%
from 14.6% compared to prior year. The resulting margin is an improvement of $0.98 or 56.7% to $2.73 per 8 ounce unit in the quarter
when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. This is a direct result from the supply chain interruption and resulting inventory
write offs in the same quarter in 2015. 

Delivery and Handling Expenses  

Delivery and handling expenses consist of delivery
costs to customers and warehouse costs incurred for handling our finished goods after production. Delivery and handling costs decreased
by 33.5% to $901,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,354,000 over the same period in 2015. The decrease
is spite of higher sales volume of 18.1%. The decrease is due to a combination of better rates and use of rail for cross country
shipments. The decrease to 7.3% for the three months of 2016 is below historic rates. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses  

Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily
of direct charges for staff compensation costs, sales support including advertising, sales promotion, marketing and trade shows
and sales operations including travel, entertainment, depreciation, utilities and storage. Selling and marketing costs decreased
by 26.1% to $918,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,242,000 over the same period in 2015 or $324,000.
This decrease over last year is primarily due to reductions in compensation related expenses of $213,000; sales support of $83,000
and operations of 28,000. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of the cost of staff compensation that includes executive, administrative, and finance personnel related costs, G A
support that includes professional fees, SEC reporting expenses, licenses, IT administration, G A operations that includes
travel, entertainment, depreciation, utilities and storage, and miscellaneous costs such as bad debt, lawsuits, taxes and permits..
Total G A expenses decreased 21.4% to $871,000 in the quarter over the same quarter in the prior year. Staff compensation expenses
decreased $26,000, G A operations decreased $38,000, G A support decreased $43,000 and miscellaneous costs decreased $130,000. 

Income from Operations  

Income from operations increased by $2,340,000
in the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, profit from operations was $196,000 as compared to
a loss of $2,144,000 in the same period of 2015. The profit was comprised of the increase in net sales of 15.1%, an improvement
in gross profit of 8.8% or a total of $1,326,000 and lower expenses of $1,014,000 as discussed above in detail. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense and bank related charges increased
$94,000 to $415,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to expenses of $321,000 in the same period of 2015.
The increase is primarily due to increased borrowing on our revolving line of credit, an additional term loan, a new capital expansion
loan and higher rates from new terms negotiated in 2015. 

Modified EBITDA  

Non-GAAP financial information is not meant
as a substitute for GAAP results but is included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company believes that the
presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s financial condition
and results of operations. 

The Company defines modified EBITDA (a non-GAAP
measurement) as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash expense for securities. Other companies
may calculate modified EBITDA differently. Management believes that the presentation of modified EBITDA provides a measure of performance
that approximates cash flow before interest expense, and is meaningful to investors. 

MODIFIED EBITDA SCHEDULE  

The $2,310,000 increase in modified EBITDA
for the three months resulted from the increases in operating profit of 2,246,000 and the EBITDA adjustments totaling $64,000 for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 The $21,000 decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to the raised asset base less
retirements of older equipment, the increase in interest expense of $94,000 was due to the increased loan balances. Stock option
compensation decrease of $9,000 was due to only 2,500 shares being granted in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the
non-recurrence of immediate vesting for key employees.

Metrics  

* Discounts and costs incurred that do not
relate to specific SKU s  

Sales  

Gross sales decreased $364,000 in 2016 to $36,141,000
from $36,505,000 or 1.0% for the same nine-month period in 2015. On an 8 ounce serving basis, gross sales decreased $0.22 per 8
ounce serving or 1.7% year over year. The main driver of the decrease was a 50.9% decrease in Reeds  Kombucha. Sequentially
or period over period, gross sales revenue was up for craft soda based products 10.6%. Overall, sequential gross sales were up
6.1%. The dilution resulted from mix of lower high unit sales of Kombucha of 50.9% and higher low unit sales of private label products
30.9%. 

Net sales decreased in 2016 $235,000 to $33,326,000
from $33,561,000 in the same nine-month period in 2015. On an 8 ounce serving basis, net sales decreased $0.16 per 8 ounce serving
or 1.4% year over year. The main driver of the lower promotional dollars spent of 4.8% or $141,000 to delivery higher volume or
0.7%. Overall net sales revenue decreased $235,000 or 0.7%. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Produced   

Cost of tangible goods sold consists of the
costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, inventory
adjustments and internal transfer costs. Idle capacity consists of direct production costs of our Los Angeles plant in excess of
charges allocated to our finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs, production supplies, repairs and maintenance,
and depreciation. Our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined on a market cost basis, which
is lower than our actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather
than added to the cost of finished goods produced. 

Cost of goods  sold  increased in 2016
to $24,820,000 from $23,378,000 or 6.2% in the same nine month period in 2015. On an 8 ounce serving basis, cost of goods  sold 
increased $0.45 per 8 ounce serving or 5.4% year over year. During 2016 the main driver of an increase in costs unallocated to
specific SKUs comprised primarily of inventory adjustments in the first quarter of $743,000 which were offset by $1,387,000 in
the prior year that occurred as a direct result from the supply chain interruption. After discounting for these adjustments, the
largest increases in cost were carrier packaging of 17.1% and co-packer labor 5.5%. 

Cost of goods  produced  increased in
2016 to $25,944,000 from $25,104,000 in the same nine month period in 2015. On an 8 ounce serving basis, cost of goods  produced
 increased $0.23 per 8 ounce serving or 2.6% year over year. The main driver of the increase is the costs unallocated to specific
SKUs in the cost of goods  sold  discussed earlier. The increase was partially offset by an improvement in LA Plant Idle Plant
costs. Idle Plant costs decreased $601,000 from $1,726,000 over the same period in 2015. 

Gross Margin  

Gross margin declined to 22.1% from 25.2% in
the same nine-month period as higher costs of 3.4% and lower sales revenue of 0.7%. On an 8 ounce basis, the margin decreased by
$0.40 or 1.4% to $2.73 in the quarter when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. This is a direct result from the higher
costs in packaging and co-packer labor discussed earlier. 

Delivery and Handling Expenses  

Delivery and handling expenses consist of delivery
costs to customers and warehouse costs incurred for handling our finished goods after production. Delivery and handling costs decreased
by 28.8% to $2,815,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,952,000 over the same period in 2015. The decrease
is spite of higher sales volume of 0.7%. The decrease is due to a combination of better rates and use of rail for cross country
shipments. The decrease to 8.4% for the nine months of 2016 is at historic rates. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses  

Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily
of direct charges for staff compensation costs, sales support including advertising, sales promotion, marketing and trade shows
and sales operations including travel, entertainment, depreciation, utilities and storage. Selling and marketing costs decreased
by 22.8% to $2,911,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,770,000 over the same period in 2015 or a decrease
of $859,000. This decrease over last year is primarily due to reductions in compensation related expenses of $384,000; sales support
of $356,000 and operations of 119,000. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of the cost of staff compensation that includes executive, administrative, and finance personnel related costs, G A
support that includes professional fees, SEC reporting expenses, licenses, IT administration, G A operations that includes
travel, entertainment, depreciation, utilities and storage, and miscellaneous costs such as bad debt, lawsuits, taxes and permits.
Total G A expenses decreased 9.8% to $3,007,000 in the quarter over the same nine months in the prior year. Staff compensation
expenses decreased $281,000, G A operations decreased $73,000, G A support decreased $10,000 and miscellaneous costs increased
$39,000. 

Loss from Operations  

The loss from operations was $1,352,000 in
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $2,597,000 in the same period of 2015. The loss narrowed as result
of sales declining 0.7% as compared to prior year, while cost of goods sold increased 3.4% which resulted in a lower gross profit
of 3.1% or $1,076,000. The lower gross profit was offset by a larger decrease in operating expenses of 21.0% or $2,321,000 resulting
in a narrowing of the loss by $1,245,000. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense and bank related charges increased
$413,000 to $1,239,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to expenses of $826,000 in the same period of 2015.
The increase is primarily due to increased borrowing on our revolving line of credit, an additional term loan and new capital expansion
loan. 

Modified EBITDA  

Non-GAAP financial information is not meant
as a substitute for GAAP results but is included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company believes that the
presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s financial condition
and results of operations. 

The Company defines modified EBITDA (a non-GAAP
measurement) as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash expense for securities. Other companies
may calculate modified EBITDA differently. Management believes that the presentation of modified EBITDA provides a measure of performance
that approximates cash flow before interest expense, and is meaningful to investors. 

MODIFIED EBITDA SCHEDULE  

The narrowing of EBITDA loss by $985,000 for
the nine months resulted from of the narrowing net loss by $832,000. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 depreciation and
amortization expense declined a net $16,000. This was due to lower depreciation on equipment and higher amortization costs related
to financing. Interest increased $416,000 as discussed above which was partially offset due to lower stock option expenses of $266,000. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had stockholders
equity of $972,000 and working capital of $274,000 compared to stockholders equity of $785,000 and working capital of $730,000
at December 31, 2015. This was a direct result from an equity transaction completed in the quarter. 

On June 2, 2016, the Company entered into a
securities purchase agreement with institutional investors in a private financing transaction for the issuance and sale of 692,412
shares of the Company s common stock and warrants to purchase 346,206 shares of common stock. The net proceeds to the Company
from the offering were $2,113,000 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Additionally, senior
management purchased 30,000 shares of its common stock at $3.90 per share with total proceeds of $117,000. 

Cash and cash equivalents at September 30,
2016 increased by $131,000 to $1,947,000 compared to $1,816,000 at December 31, 2015. Net cash used in operations decreased by
$441,000 to $1,605,000 over the same nine months in the previous year. This was the result of an increase in payments to vendors
$2,709,000 partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $823,000 Net cash used in investing activities was $585,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the year, the Company successfully completed an equity transaction that raised
net proceeds of $2,230,000 to provide the working capital to pay the vendors. (See Note 8) 

In conjunction with the additional capital
from equity sources, PMC agreed to extend the loan maturity dates for all loans to October 1, 2017. 

We believe that the Company currently has the
necessary working capital to support existing operations through the end of this year. Consistent with past refinancing practices
regarding the Line of Credit, the Company believes that we will be successful in renewing the Line of Credit for another time frame
similar to the past for a two year time frame. There are no assurances that this refinancing will be completed. Our primary capital
source will be positive cash flow from operations. If our sales goals do not materialize as planned, we believe that the Company
can reduce its operating costs and can be managed to maintain positive cash flow from operations. Historically, we have financed
our operations primarily through private sales of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, a line of credit from a financial
institution and cash generated from operations. 

We may not generate sufficient revenues from
product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations. If we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point
in the future, we eventually may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct
them or to fund our expansion and marketing and product development plans. In addition, our losses may increase in the future as
we expand our manufacturing capabilities and fund our marketing plans and product development. These losses, among other things,
have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders  equity. If we
are unable to achieve profitability, the market value of our common stock would decline and there would be a material adverse effect
on our financial condition. 

If we suffer losses from operations, our working
capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any
time, unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing
on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able
to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations, including reducing infrastructure, promotions,
personnel and other operating expenses. These events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund the growth of our operations,
take advantage of opportunities, develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly
limited. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts
receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks and trademark licenses, as well as claims and
contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarize
our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: 

Revenue Recognition . Revenue is recognized
on the sale of a product when the product is shipped, which is when the risk of loss transfers to our customers, and collection
of the receivable is reasonably assured. A product is not shipped without an order from the customer and credit acceptance procedures
performed. The allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted by management based on historical trends of returned items.
Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included in sales. The Company reimburses its wholesalers and retailers
for promotional discounts, samples and certain advertising and promotional activities used in the promotion of the Company s
products. The accounting treatment for the reimbursements for samples and discounts to wholesalers results in a reduction in the
net revenue line item. Reimbursements to wholesalers and retailers for certain advertising activities are included in selling and
marketing expenses. 

Long-Lived Assets . Our management regularly
reviews property, equipment and other long-lived assets, including identifiable amortizing intangibles, for possible impairment.
This review occurs quarterly or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management
prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized
to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows
discounted at a rate commensurate with management s estimates of the business risks. Quarterly, or earlier, if there is indication
of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the
carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less
than the carrying amount. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management s
best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. During the quarter, equipment currently in use was identified
that will be retired before the end of their useful life as the LA Plant nears completion. An impairment was recognized for $261,000
which be settled upon completion of the LA Plant. 

Management believes that the accounting estimate
related to impairment of our long lived assets, including our trademark license and trademarks, is a  critical accounting
estimate  because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to estimate
fair value, which is based on assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment
would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management s assumptions
about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past
and we expect they will continue to do so.
