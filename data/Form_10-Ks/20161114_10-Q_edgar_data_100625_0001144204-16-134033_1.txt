SIERRA MONITOR CORPORATION  

 Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed
Financial Statements 

September 30, 2016 

   Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared by Sierra Monitor Corporation  (the  Company ,
 Sierra Monitor ,  we  or  us  ), pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations; nevertheless, the Company
believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Amounts related to disclosure of December
31, 2015 balances within these interim condensed financial statements were derived from the audited 2015 financial statements and
notes thereto. These financial statements and the notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the
SEC on March 30, 2016. In the opinion of the Company, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the interim period have been included.
The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent interim period
or for the full year.  

Summary of Business  

Sierra Monitor Corporation,
a California corporation, was founded in 1978. The Company addresses the industrial and commercial facilities management market
with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions that connect and protect high-value infrastructure assets.  

Our FieldServer family
of protocol gateways is used by system integrators and original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) to enable local and
remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities. With more than 200,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols
such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is the industry s leading
multi-protocol gateway. The FieldServer multi-protocol gateway uses specialized embedded software on proprietary hardware platforms.
Embedded software enables data transfer between various devices and sub-systems within a facility by bridging between different
protocols and physical media, and additionally enables the devices and sub-systems in the facility to connect to the cloud over
Internet Protocol (IP) networks for remote monitoring, control, and analytics. Embedded software also includes an application engine
and several local web applications that run within the application engine, providing additional value to the devices being interfaced
with the gateway. Offering embedded software on proprietary hardware platforms allows us to increase the value proposition while
protecting our intellectual property. 

The FieldServer gateway
is also available to OEMs as a module for installation in customer devices and controllers under the ProtoCessor name. The FieldServer
gateways work with our newly introduced FieldPoP  solution, a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServers,
provides secure remote access to the local applications that run on the FieldServer, and integrates with third-party business applications
and advanced visualization and analytics cloud platforms. Collectively, we refer to the FieldServer gateway (including the applications
that run on it), the FieldPoP service, and the third party integrations as our  IIoT On-Ramp Suite . 

Our Sentry IT fire
and gas detection solutions are used by industrial and commercial facilities managers to protect their personnel and assets. The
motivation for installing gas detection systems is driven, in part, by industrial safety professionals guided by the United States
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, state and local governing bodies, insurance companies and various industry rule-making
bodies. The solution consists of proprietary system hardware that runs embedded controller and gateway software, detector modules
that sense the presence of various toxic and combustible gases and flames, connectivity between the modules and the controller,
and a user interface and applications that a facility manager can interact with, either locally on site or remotely over the Internet.
The complex software embedded in the various products facilitates system-wide functions such as calibration, alarm detection, notification,
and mitigation. The controller software also includes local web-based applications that simplify management of the complete solution
and a gateway to integrate the fire and gas detection solution with the facility s supervisory or management system. With
more than 100,000 detector modules sold, our fire and gas detection solutions are deployed in a variety of facilities, such as
oil, gas and chemical processing plants, wastewater treatment facilities, alternate fuel vehicle maintenance garages and other
sites where hazardous gases are used or produced.  

Our solutions are also
sold to telecommunication companies and their suppliers to manage environmental and security conditions such as temperature, gas,
and smoke in remote structures such as local DSL distribution nodes and buildings at cell tower sites. 

Accounting Policies  

a)  Revenue Recognition   

A
detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies is contained in Item 2 (Management s Discussion  and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) under Critical Accounting Policies below. The discussion is incorporated herein
by reference. 

b)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Recent
accounting pronouncements discussed in the notes to the December 31, 2015 audited financial statements, filed previously with the
SEC in our Annual Report on Form 10-K on March 30, 2016, that are required to be adopted during the year ended December 31, 2016,
did not have or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s 2016 financial statements . 

c)  Employee Stock-Based Compensation   

In March 2016, the
Company s 2006 Stock Plan expired. In April 2016, the Company s board of directors approved the Company s 2016
Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Stock Plan ) and reserved a total of (i) 279,680 Shares, plus (ii) 2,550,320
shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan immediately prior to its expiration, plus (iii) any shares
subject to stock options or restricted stock granted under the 2006 Stock Plan that, on or after the date the 2016 Stock Plan becomes
effective, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, or are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company,
with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2016 Stock Plan pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) equal to 2,668,320. Options
granted under our 2006 Stock Plan and 2016 Stock Plan are at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date, typically
vest ratably over 4 years, and expire 10 years from the grant date. 

All share-based payments
to employees (incentive stock options) are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant.
The calculated fair value is recognized as expense (net of any capitalization) over the requisite service period, net of estimated
forfeitures, using the straight-line method. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including
types of awards, employee class and historical experience. The modified prospective method of application requires compensation
expense to be recognized in the financial statements for all unvested stock options beginning in the quarter of award. The cost
is based on the grant date fair value of the stock option. Compensation expense recognized in future periods for share-based compensation
will be adjusted for the effects of estimated forfeitures. 

For the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of $286,762
and $274,263, respectively, decreasing the Company's income before provision for income taxes and net income resulting from the
recognition of compensation expense associated with employee stock options. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted
earnings in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, which were approximately $0.03 per share basic and diluted. 

d)  Subsequent Events   

Management has evaluated
events subsequent to September 30, 2016 through the date that the accompanying condensed financial statements were filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for transactions and other events which may require adjustment of and/or disclosure in such
financial statements. 

Inventories  

A summary of inventories follows: 

Net Income Per Share  

Basic earnings per
share ( EPS ) is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares consist of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.
No adjustments to earnings were made for purposes of per share calculations. 

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, outstanding options to acquire 1,472,500 and 1,459,000, shares of common stock, respectively, were
not considered potentially dilutive common shares due to the exercise price of such options being higher than the stock price used
in the EPS calculation.  

The following is a
reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

Concentrations  

No customer made up
more than 10% of accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and two customers each made up more than 10% of accounts receivable
at December 31, 2015. No customer made up more than 10% of net sales for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015. 

The Company currently
maintains substantially all of its day to day operating cash with a major financial institution. At times, cash balances may be
in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Cash balances of approximately $3,824,000 and $4,133,000
were in excess of such insured amounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Segment Information  

The Company operates
in one segment, industrial instrumentation. The Company s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ),
evaluates the performance of the Company and makes operating decisions based on financial data consistent with the presentation
in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 

In addition, the CEO
reviewed the following information on revenues by product category for the following periods: 

Line-of-Credit  

The
Company maintains a line of credit with its commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000. No borrowings have been made under
the Company s line of credit during the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 and there were no outstanding balances at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants to which it
is subject under the line of credit.  

Stock Option Grants  

No options were granted
during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016. Similarly, no options were granted during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015, however, a total of 100,000 stock options were granted during the nine-month period ended September 30,
2015 .   

Stock Option Exercise and Expiration  

In the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016, no options were exercised. A total of 12,324 shares of common stock, were issued as a result of stock
option exercises in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. During the same periods, 38,500 and 32,000 options expired,
respectively. 

Commitments and Contingencies  

From time to time,
the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these
proceedings and claims cannot be predicted, we currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which,
in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial position or results of operations.

Results of Operations   

For the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, Sierra Monitor Corporation ( we  or the  Company ) reported net sales
of $5,063,617 compared to $5,398,080 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, net sales were $14,423,206 compared with $15,342,866 in the prior year nine-month period. The sales results for the three
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 represent a decrease of 6% compared to each of the same periods in 2015. 

For the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, sales of our instrumentation products, including fire and gas detection, military sales and environment
controllers, were approximately $2,468,000 compared to approximately $2,440,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015,
representing a 1% increase. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, sales of our instrumentation products were approximately
$6,737,000 compared to approximately $7,126,000 in the same period in 2015 representing a 5% decrease. 

In the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, sales of FieldServer products were approximately $2,595,000 compared to approximately $2,958,000
in the same period in 2015, representing a 12% decrease. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, sales of our FieldServer
products were approximately $7,686,000, compared to approximately $8,217,000 in sales reported in the same period in 2015, representing
a 6% decrease. 

FieldServer sales include
both box products and original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) modules. Box products provide a platform for delivery
and operation of our software for integration with building automation systems and are generally sold to building automation integrators.
Strong increases in OEM sales offset lower sales of box products. 

Gross profit for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,880,000, or 57% of net sales, compared to approximately $3,233,000,
or 60% of net sales, in the same period in the previous year. Gross profit for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $8,304,000, or 58% of net sales, compared to approximately $9,162,000, or 60% of net sales, in the same period in
the previous year. Our gross margins are influenced primarily by product mix, discount level based on order size and sales channels.
Generally sales to OEM accounts generate lower margins. 

Expenses for research
and development, which include new product development and engineering to sustain existing products, were approximately $736,000,
or 15% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $606,000, or 11% of net sales,
in the comparable period in 2015. In the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, research and development
expenses were approximately $2,116,000, or 15% of net sales, and approximately $1,747,000, or 11% of net sales, respectively. In
the current year we have undertaken new product development related primarily to applying our FieldServer products for Internet
of Things applications. 

Selling and marketing
expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and promotional expenses were approximately $1,240,000, or 24% of net
sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $1,303,000, or 24% of net sales, in the comparable
period in the prior year. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling and marketing expenses were approximately
$3,713,000, or 26% of net sales, and approximately $3,797,000, or 25% of net sales, respectively. There has been no significant
change in our selling expenses in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the
prior year. 

General and administrative
expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, building rent, insurance expenses, information technology expenses and fees for
professional services, were approximately $767,000, or 15% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared
to approximately $827,000, or 15% of net sales, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and September 2015, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2,364,000, or 16% of net sales,
and approximately $2,358,000, or 15% of net sales, respectively. General and administrative expenses have decreased 7% in the three-month
period and remained flat in the nine-month reporting periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily
due to decreased salary and depreciation expenses partially offset by an increase in outsourced professionals. 

In the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, our income from operations was approximately $137,000 compared to income from operations of approximately
$497,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, our income from
operations was approximately $110,000 compared to income from operations of $1,260,000 in the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in income in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 is due to lower sales and lower
gross margins. 

After interest income
and provision for income tax expense, our net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $46,000
compared to net income of approximately $264,000 in the same period of 2015. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
our net loss was approximately $48,000 compared to a net income of approximately $647,000 in the same period of 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $45,000 compared to approximately $1,825,000
for the same period in 2015. Working capital was approximately $9,210,000 at September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $147,000
from December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, our balance sheet reflected approximately $4,574,000 of cash and approximately $2,873,000
of net trade receivables. At December 31, 2015, our total cash on hand was approximately $4,883,000 and our net trade receivables
were approximately $2,583,000. 

At September 30, 2016,
we had no long term liabilities except for deferred income taxes. 

We maintain a line
of credit with its commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000. No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during
the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 and there were no outstanding balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As
of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit. 

Historically, we have
financed our operations principally from cash provided by our operating activities. We believe our existing cash and accounts receivable
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our condensed financial
statements and the accompanying notes. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported on our balance sheets and the amounts of
revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but
not limited to, the accounting for revenue recognition, accounts receivable, doubtful accounts and inventories. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions
and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements: 

a)    Revenue Recognition    

We recognizes revenue
when all of the following conditions exist: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists in the form of an accepted purchase
order; (b) delivery has occurred, based on shipping terms, or services have been rendered; (c) our price to the buyer is fixed
or determinable, as documented on the accepted purchase order; and (d) collectability is reasonably assured. By product and service
type, revenues are recognized when the following specific conditions are met: 

Gas Detection and Environment
Control Products   

Gas detection and environment
control products are sold as off - the - shelf products with prices
fixed at the time of order. Orders delivered to us by phone, fax, mail or email are considered valid purchase orders and once accepted
by us are deemed to be the final understanding between us and our customer as to the specific nature and terms of the agreed-upon
sale transaction. Products are shipped and are considered delivered when (a) for FOB factory orders they leave our shipping dock
or (b) for FOB customer dock orders upon confirmation of delivery.  The creditworthiness of customers is generally assessed
prior to our acceptance of a customer s first order. Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed
a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit. 

Gas Detection and Environment
Control Services   

Gas detection and environment
control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separate from product orders.
Orders for gas detection and environment control services are accepted in the same forms as discussed for  Gas Detection and
Environment Control Products  above with hourly prices fixed at the time of order. Revenue recognition occurs only when the
service activity is completed. Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness
has generally already been assessed. In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected
in advance of the provision of services for immediate processing. 

FieldServer Products   

FieldServer products
are sold in the same manner as  Gas Detection and Environment Control Products  (as discussed above) except that the products
contain embedded software, which is integral to the operation of the device.  The software embedded in FieldServer products
includes two items:  (a) a compiled program containing (i) the basic operating system for FieldServer products, which is common
to every unit, and (ii) customized protocol drivers based on the customer order (see  FieldServer Services  below for more
information); and (b) a configuration file that identifies and links each data point as identified by the customer. We do
not deem the hardware, operating systems with protocol drivers and configuration files to be separate units of accounting because
we do not believe that they have value on a stand-alone basis. The hardware is useless without the software, and the software is
only intended to be used in FieldServer hardware. Additionally, the software included in each sale is deemed to not require significant
production, modification or customization, and therefore we recognize revenues upon the shipment or delivery of products (depending
on shipping terms), as described in  Gas Detection and Environment Control Products  above. 

FieldServer Services   

FieldServer services
consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.  Generally customers place orders for FieldServer products concurrently
with their order for protocol drivers. However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is
not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete. Orders are received in the same manner as described in  FieldServer
Products  above, but due to the non-recurring engineering aspect of the customized driver development, we are more likely to
have a written evidence trail of a quotation and a hard copy order.  The driver development involves further research after
receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release
the driver program.  When development of the driver is complete the customer participates in testing and provides written
confirmation that the driver program meets its expectations.  The customer is then able to place or release orders for FieldServer
product with the new driver loaded into it (see  FieldServer Products  above).  Revenues for driver development
are billed and recognized only after the customer s written confirmation is received. Collectability is reasonably assured
as described in  FieldServer Products  above. 

Discounts and
Allowances   

Discounts are applied
at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing. No allowances are offered to customers. 

b)    Accounts Receivable and Related Allowances    

Our domestic sales
are generally made on an open account basis unless specific experience or knowledge of the customer s potential inability
or unwillingness to meet the payment terms dictate secured payments. Our international sales are generally made based on secure
payment terms including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit. International sales are made on open account terms where
sufficient historical experience justifies the assumption of customer credit risk. In many of our larger sales, our customers are
frequently construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment. Management s
ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients  need for our services is critical to
the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses. 

We maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine adequacy. We believe that we have demonstrated the ability
to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience. 

c)    Inventories    

Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or estimated market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. We use an Enterprise Requirements
Planning ( ERP ) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and
identify excesses. The carrying value of inventory is reduced to market for slow moving and obsolete items based on historical
experience and current product demand. We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly. The adequacy of carrying amounts
is dependent upon management s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret
the data provided by the ERP system. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.   

We do not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources. 

ITEM
4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of Varun Nagaraj, our principal executive
officer, and Tamara S. Allen, our principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), which includes inquiries
made to certain other employees. Based upon that evaluation, Mr. Nagaraj and Ms. Allen concluded that, as of September 30, 2016,
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

There have been no significant changes in
our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
