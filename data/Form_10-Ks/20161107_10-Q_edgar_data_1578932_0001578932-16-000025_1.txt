Note 1   Business and Basis of Presentation 
  Description of Business 
  OCI Partners LP (the  Partnership,   OCIP,   we,   us,  or  our ) is a   Delaware   limited partnership formed on   February 7, 2013   whose focus is on the production, marketing and distribution of methanol and anhydrous ammonia. Our production facility is strategically located on the U.S. Gulf Coast near Beaumont, Texas and commenced full operations during August 2012. Our facility has pipeline connections to adjacent customers, port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia import/export jetties, allowing us to ship both products along the Gulf Coast, and truck loading facilities for both methanol and ammonia. 
  We are currently one of the larger merchant methanol producers in the United States with an annual methanol production design capacity of approximately   912,500   metric tons and an annual ammonia production design capacity of approximately   331,000   metric tons. During 2015, we executed a debottlenecking project on our production facility that included a maintenance turnaround and environmental upgrades, which we collectively refer to as our  debottlenecking project.  This project increased our annual methanol production design capacity by   25%   to approximately   912,500   metric tons and our annual ammonia production design capacity by   25%   to approximately   331,000   metric tons. Actual daily production capacity will vary depending on operating conditions and other various factors.  
  OCI Beaumont LLC ( OCIB ) is a   Texas   limited liability company formed on   December 10, 2010   as the acquisition vehicle to purchase the manufacturing facility and related assets offered for sale by Eastman Chemical Company on May 5, 2011 for   $26,500  . OCI N.V. ( OCI ), a Dutch public limited liability company, which is the ultimate parent for a group of related entities, through its subsidiaries, is a global producer of natural gas-based fertilizers and chemicals. OCI is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Euronext Amsterdam and trades under the symbol  OCI.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Partnership have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and in compliance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, neither of which requires all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and accordingly, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Partnership s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Partnership s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Operating results for the   three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or any other reporting period. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accuracy of estimates is based on accuracy of information used. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property, plant, and equipment, the valuation of property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies.

Note 2   Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than SEC issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) to communicate changes to the codification. The Partnership considers the applicability and impact of all ASU s. The following are those ASU s that are relevant to the Partnership. 
  On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The FASB issued this ASU as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards and improve comparability between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and to align the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with IFRS, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A reporting entity can apply the amendments either prospectively or retrospectively, with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 
  On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The FASB issued this ASU as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards and improve comparability between GAAP and IFRS. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 change the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. A reporting entity should apply the amendments prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.  
  On May 28, 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and permits the use of either retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Partnership is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Partnership has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

Note 3   Inventories 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Partnership s inventories consisted of finished goods. The Partnership had   no   raw materials and/or work-in-progress inventories.

Note 5   Debt 
  (a)   Debt   Related Party 
  On September 15, 2016, the intercompany revolving facility agreement between OCIB and OCI Fertilizer International B.V. ( OCI Fertilizer ) was terminated and replaced with an intercompany revolving facility agreement with OCI USA Inc. (the  Intercompany Revolving Facility ). OCI USA Inc. ("OCI USA") is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of OCI. The Intercompany Revolving Facility has a borrowing capacity of   $40,000   and a maturity date of   January 20, 2020  . The amount that can be drawn under the Intercompany Revolving Facility is limited by the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) to   $40,000   minus the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Intercompany Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the   sum of (i) the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (including as such per annum rate may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility) discussed in note 5(b), plus (ii) 0.25%.   OCIB pays a commitment fee to OCI USA under the Intercompany Revolving Facility on the undrawn available portion at a rate of   0.5%   per annum, which is included as a component of interest expense   related party on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Intercompany Revolving Facility is subordinated to indebtedness under the Term Loan B Credit Facility (as defined below) and the Revolving Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB had   $35,000   drawn under the Intercompany Revolving Facility.  
  On September 15, 2016, the intercompany loan agreement between OCIB and OCI Fertilizer was terminated and replaced with an intercompany term facility agreement with OCI USA (the  Intercompany Term Facility ). The Intercompany Term Facility has a borrowing capacity of   $200,000   and a maturity date of   January 20, 2020  . The Borrowings under the Intercompany Term Facility are subordinated to the Term B-3 Loans (as defined below) under the Term Loan B Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility.   Borrowings under the Intercompany Term Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the rate per annum applicable to the Term B Loans (including as such per annum rate may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan B Credit Facility) discussed in note 5(b), plus (ii) 0.25%.   As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB has   no   amounts drawn under the Intercompany Term Facility. 
  OCIB's ability to borrow under the intercompany credit facilities with OCI USA is dependent on OCI's ability and willingness to loan money to OCIB under those facilities. To the extent that OCI faces liquidity, capital, credit or other constraints at the time we initiate borrowings under our intercompany credit facilities, we may be unable to draw the full amount otherwise available to use under those facilities.

  On July 2, 2015, OCIB, the Partnership and OCI USA entered into an Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement (the  Incremental Term Loan Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and lender thereunder, pursuant to which OCIB incurred an incremental term loan in the principal amount of   $50,000   (the  Term B-4 Loan ) under the Term Loan B Credit Facility. The Term B-4 Loan has terms and provisions identical to the Existing Term B Loans, and the Term B-4 Loan and the Existing Term B Loans collectively comprise a single tranche of Term B Loans under the Term Loan B Credit Facility.  
  On October 16, 2015, OCIB, the Partnership and OCI USA entered into Amendment No. 5 and Waiver ( Term Loan Amendment No. 5 ) to the Term Loan B Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto.

     In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB may not permit, on the last day of any fiscal quarter (i) the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio to exceed (a) in the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016,   4.75   to 1.00, (b) in the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017,   5.00   to 1.00 and (c) each fiscal quarter ending thereafter,   1.75   to 1.00 and (ii) the consolidated interest coverage ratio on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than (a)   2.50   to 1.00, in the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 and (b)   5.00   to 1.00, each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) (A) consolidated senior secured debt less (B) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents included on the consolidated balance sheet to (ii) consolidated EBITDA for the last four quarters. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated EBITDA for the last four quarters to (ii) consolidated interest expense for the last four quarters. For the period ending   September 30, 2016  , we applied the Consolidated EBITDA Material Project Adjustments (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Facility) to our calculation of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Facility) in computing the aforementioned ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB s consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio was   4.60   to 1.00, and its consolidated interest coverage ratio was   2.57   to 1.00. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the Term Loan B Credit Facility, OCIB s obligations under the Term Loan B Credit Facility may be accelerated. 
  The Term Loan B Credit Facility also contains various nonfinancial covenants, which include, among others, undertakings with respect to reporting requirements, maintenance of specified insurance coverage, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership was in compliance with all these covenants. Due primarily to decreases in average sales prices, management believes we may not be in compliance with certain covenants as of December 31, 2016 and thereafter. We expect to explore multiple options to prevent or remediate such noncompliance, including refinancing the credit facilities and/or seeking waivers or amendments to the credit facilities.  
  The Term Loan B Credit Facility contains events of default customary for credit facilities of this nature, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay any principal, interest or fees when due, failure to satisfy any covenant, untrue representations or warranties, impairment of liens, events of default under any other loan document, default under any other material debt agreements, insolvency, certain bankruptcy proceedings, change of control and material litigation resulting in a final judgment against any borrower or subsidiary guarantor. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the Term Loan B Credit Facility, the lenders may, among other things, accelerate and declare the outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable and exercise remedies against OCIB, the Partnership and the collateral as may be available to the lenders under the Term Loan B Credit Facility and other loan documents.

Outstanding principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at OCIB s option at either LIBOR plus a margin of 3.50% or a base rate plus a margin of 2.50%.   OCIB also pays a commitment fee of   1.40%   per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has a one-year term that may be extended for additional one-year periods subject to the consent of the lenders. OCIB is required to repay in full all outstanding revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, commencing September 30, 2016 provided that with respect to the repayment occurring on September 30, 2016, OCIB shall only be required to repay an amount such that no more than   $20,000   in aggregate principal amount of the revolving loans remain outstanding on such date after giving effect to such repayment. As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB had   no   amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
  OCIB s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Partnership and certain of its future subsidiaries other than OCIB. OCIB s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien (which is pari passu with the first priority lien securing obligations under the Term Loan B Credit Facility) on substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of OCIB and the Partnership. 
  In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants and provisions that affect OCIB and the Partnership, including, among others, customary covenants and provisions: 
             
    prohibiting OCIB from incurring indebtedness (subject to customary exceptions); 
                
    limiting OCIB s ability and that of the Partnership from creating or incurring specified liens on their respective properties (subject to customary exceptions);

    prohibiting consolidations, mergers and asset transfers by OCIB and the Partnership (subject to customary exceptions).

As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB may not permit, on the last day of any fiscal quarter (i) the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio to exceed (a) in the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016,   4.75   to 1.00, (b) in the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017,   5.00   to 1.00 and (c) each fiscal quarter ending thereafter,   1.75   to 1.00 and (ii) the consolidated interest coverage ratio on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than (a)   2.50   to 1.00, in the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 and (b)   5.00   to 1.00, each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) (A) consolidated senior secured debt less (B) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents included on the consolidated balance sheet to (ii) consolidated EBITDA for the last four quarters. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated EBITDA for the last four quarters to (ii) consolidated interest expense for the last four quarters. For the period ending   September 30, 2016  , we applied the Consolidated EBITDA Material Project Adjustments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) to our calculation of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) in computing the aforementioned ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB s consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio was   4.60   to 1.00, and its consolidated interest coverage ratio was   2.57   to 1.00. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, OCIB s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various nonfinancial covenants, which include, among others, undertaking with respect to reporting requirements, maintenance of specified insurance coverage, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership was in compliance with all of these covenants. Due primarily to decreases in average sales prices, management believes we may not be in compliance with certain covenants as of December 31, 2016 and thereafter. We expect to explore multiple options to prevent or remediate such noncompliance, including refinancing the credit facilities and/or seeking waivers or amendments to the credit facilities.

OVERVIEW 
  We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in February 2013 whose focus is on the production, marketing and distribution of methanol and anhydrous ammonia. Our production facility is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast near Beaumont and commenced full operations during August 2012. Our facility has pipeline connections to adjacent customers, port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia import/export jetties, allowing us to ship both products along the Gulf Coast, and truck loading facilities for both methanol and ammonia. 
  We are currently one of the larger merchant methanol producers in the United States with an annual methanol production design capacity of approximately 912,500 metric tons and an annual ammonia production design capacity of approximately 331,000 metric tons. During 2015, we executed a debottlenecking project on our production facility that included a maintenance turnaround and environmental upgrades, which we collectively refer to as our  debottlenecking project.  This project increased our annual methanol production design capacity by 25% to approximately 912,500 metric tons and our annual ammonia production design capacity by 25% to approximately 331,000 metric tons. Actual daily production capacity will vary depending on operating conditions and other various factors.  
  Both methanol and ammonia are global commodities that are essential building blocks for numerous end-use products. Methanol is a liquid petrochemical that is used in a variety of industrial and energy-related applications. The primary use of methanol is to make other chemicals, with approximately 60% of global methanol demand being used to produce formaldehyde, acetic acid and a variety of other chemicals that form the foundation of a large number of chemical derivatives. These derivatives are used to produce a wide range of products, including adhesives for the lumber industry, plywood, particle board and laminates, resins to treat paper and plastic products, and also paint and varnish removers, solvents for the textile industry and polyester fibers for clothing and carpeting. Energy related applications consume the remaining 40% of methanol demand. In recent years, there has been a strong demand for methanol in energy applications such as gasoline blending, biodiesel and as a feedstock in the production of dimethyl ether ( DME ) and Methyl tertiary-butyl ether ( MTBE ), particularly in China. Methanol blending in gasoline is currently not permitted in the United States. Ammonia, produced in anhydrous form (containing no water) from the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen, constitutes the base feedstock for nearly all of the world s nitrogen chemical production. In the United States, ammonia is primarily used as a feedstock to produce nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea and ammonium sulfate, and is also directly applied to soil as a fertilizer. In addition, ammonia is widely used in industrial applications, particularly in the Texas Gulf Coast market, including in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, resins and numerous other chemical derivatives.

Our Debottlenecking Project 
  As a means of maximizing our production efficiencies and reducing our energy consumption, we executed a debottlenecking project on our production facility that included a maintenance turnaround and environmental upgrades. This project increased our annual methanol production design capacity by 25% to approximately 912,500 metric tons and our annual ammonia production design capacity by 25% to approximately 331,000 metric tons. The total cost of the debottlenecking project (including costs associated with a turnaround and environmental upgrades) was approximately $384.0 million (excluding capitalized interest).  
  As part of our debottlenecking project, we completed the following: 
             
    installed a selective catalytic reduction unit; 
                
    replaced reformer tubes, which will result in increased synthesis gas production; 
                
    installed a pre-reformer; 
                
    installed a saturator; 
                
    installed an additional flare; 
                
    modified the synthesis gas compressor and steam turbine to handle the increased volume of synthesis gas; 
                
    modified the convection section and the heat exchangers; 
                
    replaced refractories; 
                
    increased the capacity of the synthesis gas compressor and the refrigeration compressor on our ammonia production unit and replaced several heat exchangers and vessels to handle the higher volume; and 
                
    replaced and/or refurbished equipment that caused unplanned downtime. 
     Our depreciation expense has increased from the additional assets placed into service from our debottlenecking project. In addition, our production volumes and cost of goods sold are greater in subsequent periods following the completion of the debottlenecking project than in prior periods. Thus, our results of operations for periods prior to and after the completion of our debottlenecking project may not be comparable. 
  Key Industry Factors 
  Supply and Demand 
  Revenues and cash flow from operations are significantly affected by methanol and ammonia prices. The price at which we ultimately sell our methanol and ammonia depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for methanol and ammonia. 
  Methanol  . The primary use of methanol is to make other chemicals, with approximately 60% of global methanol demand being used to produce formaldehyde, acetic acid and a variety of other chemicals that form the foundation of a large number of chemical derivatives. These derivatives are used to produce a wide range of products, including adhesives for the lumber industry, plywood, particle board and laminates, resins to treat paper and plastic products, paint and varnish removers, solvents for the textile industry and polyester fibers for clothing and carpeting. 
  Energy-related applications consume the remaining 40% of global methanol demand. In recent years, there has been a strong demand for methanol in energy applications such as gasoline blending, biodiesel and as a feedstock in the production of DME and MTBE, particularly in China. Methanol blending in gasoline is currently not permitted in the United States.  
  Historically, demand for methanol in chemical derivatives has been closely correlated to levels of global economic activity, energy prices and industrial production. Because methanol derivatives are used extensively in the building industry, demand for these derivatives rises and falls with building and construction cycles, as well as the level of production of wood products, housing starts, refurbishments and related customer spending. Demand for methanol is also affected by automobile production, durable goods production, industrial investment and environmental and health trends. Methanol is predominately produced from natural gas, but is also produced from coal, particularly in China. Lower natural gas prices and improving economic conditions have resulted in an increase in methanol supply in the United States.

Ammonia  . The fertilizer industry is the major end-user of ammonia, with approximately 80% used for the production of various fertilizers or, to a much lesser extent, for direct application into the ground. Ammonia is also used to produce various industrial products including blasting/mining compounds (ammonium nitrate); fibers and plastics (acrylonitrile, caprolactam and other nylon intermediates, isocyanates and other urethane intermediates, amino resins); and NOx emission reducing agents (ammonia, urea) among others. While these non-fertilizer applications only account for approximately 20% of global ammonia demand, this sector plays a much more significant role in demand for imported ammonia, accounting for more than one-third of global trade in ammonia. 
  In the United States, there is a meaningful correlation between demand for nitrogen fertilizer products and crop prices. Demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on many factors, including crop prices, their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. High crop prices incentivize farmers to increase fertilizer application in order to maximize crop yields. Thus, high crop prices tend to buoy fertilizer demand, resulting in higher demand for ammonia. In addition, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand, because farmers tend to apply nitrogen fertilizer during two short periods, one in the spring and the other in the fall. 
  Natural Gas Prices 
  Natural gas is the primary feedstock for our production of methanol and ammonia. Operating at full capacity, our methanol and ammonia production units together require approximately 110,000 to 120,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas, as of   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, our profitability depends in large part on the cost of our natural gas feedstock, which approached ten-year lows at the beginning of 2015.  
  For the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , natural gas feedstock costs represented approximately 60% of our cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation) and cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation)   related party ( Total Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation) ) as compared to 55% during the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , we spent approximately $29.0 million on natural gas feedstock supplies, which equaled an average cost per MMBtu of approximately   $2.88  , as compared to approximately $28.8 million on natural gas feedstock supplies, and an average cost per MMBtu of approximately   $2.88   during the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  For the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , natural gas feedstock costs represented approximately 51% of our Total Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation) as compared to 48% during the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , we spent approximately $68 million on natural gas feedstock supplies, which equaled an average cost per MMBtu of approximately   $2.40  , as compared to approximately $59 million on natural gas feedstock supplies, and an average cost per MMBtu of approximately   $2.91   during the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  We have connections to one major interstate and three major intrastate natural gas pipelines that provide us access to significantly more natural gas supply than our facility requires and flexibility in sourcing our natural gas feedstock. We currently source natural gas from Kinder Morgan and Houston Pipe Line Company. In addition, our facility is connected to a natural gas pipeline owned by Florida Gas Transmission Company, LLC ("Florida Gas Transmission"). We believe that we have ready access to an abundant supply of natural gas for the foreseeable future due to our location and connectivity to major natural gas pipelines. 
  According to the Short-term Energy Outlook published by the Energy Information Administration (the "EIA") in October 2016, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price are forecast to average $3.04 MMBtu during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.07 MMBtu in 2017. The EIA projects that U.S. total natural gas consumption will increase 1.6% in 2016 and 1.0% in 2017. The growth is largely driven by demand in the industrial sectors as new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors come online. During the same time period, U.S. natural gas production is expected to decrease by approximately 1.6% in 2016 and increase by approximately 4.8% in 2017. As natural gas is the feedstock for the majority of global methanol and ammonia production, having a low cost natural gas feedstock is a significant competitive advantage for U.S. producers.

Key Operational Factors 
  Product Sales Contracts 
  We are party to methanol sales contracts with several customers, including but not limited to Methanex Methanol Company LLC ("Methanex") and Koch Methanol LLC. Our customers have no minimum volume purchase obligations under these contracts, may determine not to purchase any more methanol from us at any time and may purchase methanol from other suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, our methanol sales contracts set our pricing terms to reflect a specified discount to a published monthly benchmark methanol price (Argus or Southern Chemical), and our methanol is sold on an FOB basis when transported by barge, pipeline, and our methanol truck loading facility. The payment terms under our methanol sales contacts are net 25-30 days. For the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , methanol sales contracts with Methanex and Koch Methanol LLC accounted for approximately 33% and 17%, respectively, of our revenues and revenues   related party ( Total Revenues ). 
  We are party to ammonia sales contracts with several customers, including but not limited to PCI Nitrogen, LLC (formally known as Rentech) and Lucite. Our customers have no minimum volume purchase obligations under these contracts, may determine not to purchase any more ammonia from us at any time and may purchase ammonia from other suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, these contracts set our pricing terms to reflect a specified discount to a published monthly benchmark ammonia price (CFR Tampa), and our ammonia is sold on an FOB basis when transported by barge, pipeline, and our ammonia truck loading facility. The payment terms under our ammonia sales contacts are net 30 days. For the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , ammonia sales contracts with PCI Nitrogen, LLC accounted for approximately 15% of our Total Revenues. 
  During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , we delivered approximately 55% of our total sales by barge, 38% of our total sales by pipeline, 4% of our total sales through our methanol truck loading facility, and approximately 3% of our sales through our ammonia truck loading facility. 
  Facility Reliability 
  The amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the sales and production volumes of methanol and ammonia. These volumes are primarily affected by the capacity utilization rates of our production units, which is the total production volume for a production unit for a given period divided by the production capacity of that production unit. Production capacity is determined by the product of the daily design capacity for a production unit and the number of days during a period, excluding planned downtime. Maintaining consistent, safe and reliable operations at our facility are critical to our financial performance and results of operations. Efficient production of methanol and ammonia requires reliable and stable operations at our facility due to the high costs associated with planned and unplanned downtime, which may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a temporary decrease in working capital investment and related inventory position. As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate for each day of unplanned downtime our lost opportunity cost to be approximately $250,000 to $350,000 per day. This estimate does not include the additional repair and maintenance costs associated with unplanned downtime. 
  We expect to perform maintenance turnarounds approximately every four years, which will typically last approximately four weeks and cost approximately $24.0 million per turnaround. We will perform significant maintenance capital projects at our facility during a turnaround to minimize disruption to our operations and to maintain or improve reliability. We executed a turnaround as part of our debottlenecking project which was completed in April 2015. We expect that the next turnaround will occur in 2019.

  In order to maintain our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 90% or more of our gross income in each tax year must be  qualifying income  under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ). If less than 90% of our gross income is qualifying income in any tax year, then we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes for such tax year and all subsequent tax years. 
  Prior to our initial public offering, we requested and received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the income derived from processing and marketing gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol and synthesis gas produced through the processing of natural gas would constitute qualifying income. 
  On May 6, 2015, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury published proposed regulations that provide industry-specific guidance regarding whether income earned from certain activities will constitute qualifying income. In the event that an activity does not satisfy the standards set forth, the proposed regulations provide a ten-year transition period for publicly

traded partnerships, like us, that have received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that the income earned from such activity is qualifying income. 
  If these proposed regulations become final in their currently proposed form, the regulations would make it difficult or impossible for our income derived from the production and marketing of methanol and synthesis gas to constitute qualifying income following the expiration of the ten-year transition period, which would commence on the date such regulations are published as final regulations.   
  The IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury requested comments from industry participants regarding the standards set forth in these proposed regulations. We submitted comments on the proposed regulations on August 4, 2015 and testified before the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury at a public hearing on the proposed regulations held on October 27, 2015. In the event that we do not satisfy the standards set forth in the regulations, if and when such regulations become final, and assuming such final regulations provide for the currently proposed ten-year transition period, we may continue to rely on our private letter ruling during the ten-year transition period, which will allow us to maintain our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to continue to execute our business strategy. In order to maintain our partnership status following the expiration of any transition period, we will likely need to establish a new corporate subsidiary to own and operate our methanol business, which subsidiary will be subject to entity level taxation at the maximum federal income tax rate applicable to corporations. The taxation of such corporate subsidiary could materially reduce the earnings we derive from our methanol business and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. If we are unable to own and operate our methanol business through a corporate subsidiary, we may be unable to maintain our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with our existing businesses, and all of our income would become subject to entity level taxation at the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations. Our loss of partnership status for U.S. federal income tax purposes would materially reduce our distributable cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. We will continue to evaluate ways to mitigate the impact of the proposed regulations on our business and partnership status. 
  How We Evaluate Our Operations 
  Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include capacity utilization and EBITDA (as defined below). We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and frequently review these measurements to analyze trends and make decisions. 
  Capacity Utilization 
  During the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , our ammonia and methanol production units were both in operation for 91 days. During the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , the ammonia and methanol production unit experienced 14.5 hours and 18 hours, respectively, of unplanned downtime due to severe thunderstorms and lightning strikes that tripped both plants. During the   three-months ended September 30, 2015   our ammonia and methanol production units were in operation for 80 days and 91 days, respectively. During the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , our ammonia and methanol production units were shut down for 12 days and 1 day, respectively, due to an internal failure in the steam turbine.  
  We produced approximately   85,480   metric tons of ammonia and approximately   220,791   metric tons of methanol during the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , representing capacity utilization rates of   102%   and   96%   for the ammonia and methanol production units, respectively, as compared to production of approximately   72,960   metric tons of ammonia and   226,057   metric tons of methanol during the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , representing capacity utilization rates of   87%   and   98%   for the ammonia and methanol production units, respectively.  
  During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , our ammonia and methanol production units were in operation for 268 days and 257 days, respectively. During the first quarter of 2016, we experienced only 6 hours of downtime in the ammonia production unit. During the second quarter of 2016, we experienced an underground cooling water line leakage which caused unplanned downtime of approximately 5 days in the ammonia production unit and approximately 8.5 days in the methanol production unit. We also took our methanol production unit off-line for approximately 8.5 days during the second quarter of 2016 in order to make repairs to our reformer. The remaining downtime for both production units occurred during the third quarter of 2016, as explained above. During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015   our ammonia and methanol production units were in operation for 186 days and 189 days, respectively. During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015  , our ammonia and methanol production units were shut down for 71 and 82 days, respectively, in order to complete the debottlenecking project.

We produced approximately   248,854   metric tons of ammonia and approximately   619,974   metric tons of methanol during the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , representing capacity utilization rates of   100%   and   91%   for the ammonia and methanol production units, respectively, as compared to production of approximately   156,784   metric tons of ammonia and   440,684   metric tons of methanol during the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015  , representing capacity utilization rates of   88%   and   95%   for the ammonia and methanol production units, respectively (excluding planned downtime associated with the debottlenecking project). During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015  , our ammonia and methanol production units were shut down for 71 and 82 days, respectively, in order to complete the debottlenecking project. 
  EBITDA 
  EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus (i) interest expense and other financing costs (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation expense. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: 
             
    the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; and 
                
    our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to financing methods and capital structure. 
       
  EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). EBITDA may have material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. In addition, EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation because each company may define EBITDA differently.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015: 
  Revenues 

Our Total Revenues were approximately $66.1 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $103.7 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . Our methanol revenues were approximately $47.0 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $73.1 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease of 36%. The decrease in methanol revenue is due to the corresponding decrease in methanol sales prices. Our ammonia revenues were approximately $19.1 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $30.6 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease of 38%. The decrease in ammonia revenue is due to the corresponding decrease in ammonia sales prices. 
  We sold approximately 219,591 metric tons of methanol during the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately 221,607 metric tons of methanol during the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease in sales volumes of 1%. The average sales prices per metric ton for methanol during the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   was $214 per metric ton compared to $330 per metric ton for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease of 35%. The decrease in price is due to an increase in global supply, from the commissioning of new methanol capacity additions in North America and increases in global production utilization rates, which have outpaced demand growth. Sales of methanol comprised approximately 71.1% of our Total Revenues for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 70.5% of our Total Revenues for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Set forth below is a table showing average methanol sales prices per metric ton, per quarter for the previous seven fiscal quarters.

We sold approximately 81,343 metric tons of ammonia during the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately 73,303 metric tons of ammonia during the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents an increase in sales volumes of 11%. The average sales prices per metric ton for ammonia during the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   was $235 per metric ton compared to $418 per metric ton for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease of 44%. The price decrease is attributed to global supply and demand variations. Sales of ammonia comprised approximately 28.9% of our Total Revenues for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 29.5% of our Total Revenues for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Set forth below is a table showing average ammonia sales prices per metric ton, per quarter for the previous seven fiscal quarters. 

Cost of Sales (exclusive of depreciation) 

Total Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation) was approximately $48.3 million and 73% of Total Revenue for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to Total Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation) of approximately $52.1 million and 50% of Total Revenue for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in Total Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation) as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the decrease in Total Revenue. Our Total Revenues decreased by 36% for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three-months ended September 30, 2015   due to the decline in both methanol and ammonia average realized sales prices.  
    
  For the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , natural gas feedstock costs represented approximately 60.2% of our Total Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation) as compared to 55.2% during the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . Our purchase price of natural gas was $2.88 per MMBtu for both the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.

  Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
  Our selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $2.4 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $4.3 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease of 44%. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an update in our 2016 property tax estimate and a decrease in our insurance expense.  
  Our selling, general and administrative expenses   related party were approximately $1.1 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to approximately $0.9 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  , which represents an increase of 22%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses   related party was primarily due to an increase in costs incurred under the Omnibus Agreement in connection with reimbursement of providing selling, general and administrative services and management and operating services to manage and operate the business and affairs of the Partnership. Please read note 6   Related Party Transactions to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the Omnibus Agreement.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was approximately $10.1 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $7.3 million for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   three-months ended September 30, 2016  , interest expense was higher than the comparable period as a result of increased borrowings and amendments to our Term Loan B Credit Facility that resulted in higher interest rates. During the three-months ended September 30, 2015, we capitalized $197,000 of interest expense due to the accumulated expenditures related to the debottlenecking project. Capitalized interest costs are determined by applying a weighted average interest rate paid on borrowings to the average amount of accumulated capital expenditures in the period. No interest expense was capitalized during 2016. 
  Interest expense related party was approximately $143,000 for the   three-months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $51,000 for the   three-months ended September 30, 2015  . Interest expense related party relates to interest expense and a commitment fee on the unused portion of our Intercompany Revolving Facility owed to OCI USA Inc. OCI USA Inc. ("OCI USA") is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of OCI.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, pay distributions to our partners, fund capital expenditures and service our debt. We believe that our current and expected sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these operating needs and capital expenditures for the next 12 months. Our sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations, cash on hand, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Intercompany Revolving Facility and the Intercompany Term Facility described below. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently anticipate as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors outside our control.  
  In the past, we have received waivers for, or entered into amendments to our Term Loan B Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility to address, certain noncompliance of financial and other covenants. Due primarily to decreases in average sales prices, management believes we may not be in compliance with certain covenants as of December 31, 2016 and thereafter. We expect to explore multiple options to prevent or remediate such noncompliance, including refinancing the credit facilities and/or seeking waivers or amendments to the credit facilities. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to execute such prevention or remedial actions. If we are unable to execute the appropriate prevention or remedial actions, such noncompliance could result in an event of default under our credit facilities. Upon a default, our lenders would have all remedies available to a secured lender and could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, cause their loans to become immediately due and payable in full, institute foreclosure proceedings against us or our assets and force us and our subsidiary into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
  Depending on the needs of our business, we may for time to time seek to issue additional common units, incur additional debt, modify the terms of our existing debt, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.  
  Distributions 
    Under our current cash distribution policy, we intend to distribute 100% of the cash available for distribution that we generate each quarter. Cash available for distribution for each quarter will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner following the end of such quarter. Cash available for distribution is generally equal to EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) debt service requirements, (ii) maintenance and expansion capital expenditures which is composed of (a) capital expenditures and (b) reserves for scheduled turnaround expenses, (iii) reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of our general partner deems necessary or appropriate, if any, (iv) taxes and (v) rounding for distributions which reflects the positive or negative adjustment necessary to eliminate any fraction of a cent per unit on our declared cash distributions. We do not intend to maintain excess distribution coverage for the purpose of maintaining stability or growth in our quarterly distributions or otherwise to reserve cash for distributions, nor do we intend to incur debt to pay quarterly distributions. As such, cash available for distribution for each quarter will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner following the end of such quarter. Cash available for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Cash available for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or operating income, as a measure of operating performance. In addition, cash available for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered an alternative to, cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Cash available for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  The below table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and cash available for distribution to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated.

Debt service excludes amortization of deferred financing costs. 
     Because our policy is to distribute 100% of cash available for distribution each quarter, without reserving cash for future distributions or borrowing to pay distributions during periods of low cash flow from operations, our unitholders will have direct exposure to fluctuations in the amount of cash generated by our business. We expect that the amount of our quarterly distributions, if any, will vary based on our operating cash flow during each quarter. Our quarterly cash distributions, if any, will not be stable and will vary from quarter to quarter as a direct result of, among other things, variations in our operating performance and variations in our cash flow caused by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, methanol and ammonia as well as our working capital requirements, planned and unplanned downtime and capital expenditures and our margins from selling our products. These variations may be significant. The board of directors of our general partner may change our cash distribution policy at any time and from time to time. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay cash distributions to our unitholders on a quarterly or other basis.

Credit Facilities 
  Described below are the credit facilities under which OCI Beaumont LLC ( OCIB ) may draw extra liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  . Please read Item I  Financial Statements , note 5   Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to OCIB s credit facilities. 
  Term Loan B Credit Facility 
  On August 20, 2013, OCIB, as borrower, and OCI USA, as guarantor, entered into a senior secured term loan credit facility (as supplemented by a credit agreement joinder, dated as of October 18, 2013, under which the Partnership became a party to such credit facility as a guarantor, and as subsequently amended through and in effect as of   September 30, 2016  , the  Term Loan B Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of institutional lenders and investors and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal outstanding under the Term Loan B Credit Facility was $437.4 million. Although we do not have any additional committed capacity from identified lenders or investors, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had capacity to incur another $50.0 million under the Term Loan B Credit Facility in the form of an additional incremental facility, subject to receiving commitments from lenders to provide such an additional amount. Furthermore, the Term Loan B Credit Facility contains customary covenants and conditions based on the maintenance of certain senior secured net leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios (see note 5   Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description). As a result of such covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to refinance our debt at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, or prevent or remediate such potential noncompliance discussed above, including refinancing the credit facilities and/or seeking waivers or amendments to the credit facilities, our ability to fund our operations and our ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the Term Loan B Credit Facility, OCIB s obligations under the Term Loan B Credit Facility may be accelerated which could impair our ability to fund our operations and our ability to make cash distributions. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  On April 4, 2014, OCIB as borrower, the Partnership as a guarantor, Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders entered into a revolving credit agreement (as subsequently amended through and in effect as of   September 30, 2016  , the  Revolving Credit Facility ), with an initial aggregate borrowing capacity of up to $40.0 million (less any amounts borrowed under the Intercompany Revolving Facility (as defined below)), including a $20.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has a one-year term that may be extended for additional one-year periods subject to the consent of the lenders. As a result of Revolving Credit Amendment No. 5 entered into on March 17, 2016, outstanding principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at OCIB s option at either LIBOR plus a margin of 3.50% or a base rate plus a margin of 2.50%. OCIB pays a commitment fee of 1.40% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. OCIB is required to repay in full all outstanding revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, commencing September 30, 2016 provided that with respect to the repayment occurring on September 30, 2016, OCIB shall only be required to repay an amount such that no more than $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the revolving loans remain outstanding on such date after giving effect to such repayment. 
  Due to the $35.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Intercompany Revolving Facility, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had $5.0 million in additional committed capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants and conditions based on the maintenance of certain senior secured net leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios (see note 5   Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description). As a result of such covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to refinance our debt at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, or prevent or remediate such potential noncompliance discussed above, including refinancing the credit facilities and/or seeking waivers or amendments to the credit facilities, our ability to fund our operations and our ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, OCIB s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated which could impair our ability to fund our operations and our ability to make cash distributions. As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Intercompany Revolving Facility 
  On September 15, 2016, the intercompany revolving facility agreement between OCIB and OCI Fertilizer International B.V. ( OCI Fertilizer ) was terminated and replaced with an intercompany revolving facility agreement with OCI USA (the  Intercompany Revolving Facility ). The Intercompany Revolving Facility has a borrowing capacity of $40.0 million and a maturity date of January 20, 2020. The amount that can be drawn under the Intercompany Revolving Facility is limited by the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined above) to $40.0 million minus the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (see note 5(a)   Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description). Interest on borrowings under the Intercompany Revolving Facility accrue at the rate equal to the sum of (i) the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (including as such per annum rate may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility) plus (ii) 25 basis points. We pay a commitment fee to OCI USA on the unused portion of the Intercompany Revolving Facility equal to 0.5% per annum, which is included as a component of interest expense   related party on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Borrowings under the facility are subordinated to indebtedness under the Term Loan B Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB had $35.0 million outstanding under the Intercompany Revolving Facility. 
  OCIB's ability to borrow under the Intercompany Revolving Facility with OCI USA is dependent on OCI's ability and willingness to loan money to OCIB under this facility. To the extent that OCI faces liquidity, capital, credit or other constraints at the time we initiate borrowings under our Intercompany Revolving Facility, we may be unable to draw the full amount otherwise available to use under this facility.  
  Intercompany Term Facility 
  On September 15, 2016, the intercompany loan agreement between OCIB and OCI Fertilizer was terminated and replaced with an intercompany term facility agreement with OCI USA (the  Intercompany Term Facility ). The Intercompany Term Facility has a borrowing capacity of $200.0 million and a maturity date of January 20, 2020 (see note 5(a)   Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description). Borrowings under the Intercompany Term Facility bear interest at an interest rate equal to the sum of (i) the rate per annum applicable to the Term Loan B Credit Facility (including as such per annum rate may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan B Credit Facility), plus (ii) 0.25% and are subordinated to indebtedness under the Term Loan B Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , OCIB had no borrowings outstanding under the Intercompany Term Facility.  
  OCIB's ability to borrow under the Intercompany Term Facility with OCI USA is dependent on OCI's ability and willingness to loan money to OCIB under this facility. To the extent that OCI faces liquidity, capital, credit or other constraints at the time we initiate borrowings under our Intercompany Term Facility, we may be unable to draw the full amount otherwise available to use under this facility.  
  Intercompany Equity Commitment 
  On November 27, 2013, we and OCI USA entered into a letter agreement providing for OCI USA s obligation to make equity contributions to us under certain circumstances (the  Intercompany Equity Commitment ). Pursuant to the Intercompany Equity Commitment, (i) if, prior to the completion of our debottlenecking project, we or OCIB had liquidity needs for working capital or other purposes and the restrictions under the Term Loan B Credit Facility or any other debt instruments of ours or OCIB prohibit us or OCIB from incurring sufficient additional debt to fund such liquidity needs, then upon notice from us, OCI USA (or an affiliate designated by OCI USA) would provide such liquidity to the extent of such needs in the form of an equity contribution to us and (ii) in the event OCIB fails to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the Term Loan B Credit Facility as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, then upon notice from us, OCI USA (or an affiliate designated by OCI USA that is not a party to the Term Loan B Credit Facility) would make cash contributions to us as common equity in the amount of the cure amount and by the date required by the Term Loan B Credit Facility, so that we could further contribute such funds to OCIB to cure such non-compliance, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Term Loan B Credit Facility. OCI USA was not be obligated to make aggregate equity contributions to us in excess of $100.0 million pursuant to the Intercompany Equity Commitment. 
  On November 10, 2014, OCIP Holding LLC ( OCIP Holding ) made a $60.0 million capital contribution pursuant to the Intercompany Equity Commitment in exchange for 2,995,372 common units. On April 17, 2015, OCIP Holding, made an additional $60.0 million capital contribution, which consisted of $40.0 million drawn under the Intercompany Equity Commitment and an additional $20.0 million cash contribution, in exchange for 3,502,218 common units. Due to the capital contributions by OCIP Holding on November 10, 2014 and April 17, 2015, and the completion of the debottlenecking project, OCI USA has no further obligation to make equity contributions to us under the Intercompany Equity Commitment.

Debt Ratings 
  On August 4, 2016, Moody s Investor Service downgraded our corporate family credit rating and our Term Loan B Credit Facility rating to  B2  from  B1  and revised its outlook to negative. On September 9, 2016, Standard   Poor's lowered its corporate credit rating to  CCC+  from  B , lowered its rating on the Term Loan B Credit Facility to  B-  from  B+  and affirmed its stable outlook. Our ability to obtain additional external financing and the related cost of borrowing may be affected by our debt ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the major credit rating agencies. The ratings are subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the respective credit rating agencies. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  We divide our capital expenditures into two categories: maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing or the construction or development of new capital assets) made to maintain, including over the long term, our production capacity, operating income or asset base (including capital expenditures relating to turnarounds), or to comply with environmental, health, safety or other regulations. Maintenance capital expenditures that are required to comply with regulations may also improve the output, efficiency or reliability of our facility. Major maintenance capital expenditures that extend the life or improve the safety or efficiency of the asset are capitalized and amortized over the period of expected benefits. Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. A turnaround is capitalized and amortized over a four year period, which is the time lapse between turnarounds. Expansion capital expenditures are capital expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our production capacity, operating income or asset base over the long term. Expansion capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the period of expected benefits.  
  We recorded maintenance capital expenditures related to our capital spares project and other various small projects in the amount of approximately $2.9 million and $7.4 million for the   three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. We recorded maintenance capital expenditures related to the turnaround and our capital spares project in the amount of approximately $0.5 million and $55.5 million for the   three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. We expect to perform maintenance turnarounds approximately every four years, which will typically last approximately four weeks and cost approximately $24.0 million per turnaround. We will perform significant maintenance capital projects at our facility during a turnaround to minimize disruption to our operations, and capitalize the costs related to these projects as property, plant and equipment and will classify the amounts as maintenance capital expenditures. We executed a turnaround as part of our debottlenecking project which was completed in April 2015. We expect that the next turnaround will occur in 2019. 
  We did not have any expansion capital expenditures during the   three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to approximately $1.2 million and $124.9 million for the   three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, for expenditures related to our debottlenecking project. Please read  Our Debottlenecking Project  for additional information.  
  Working Capital 
  Working capital is the amount by which total current assets exceed total current liabilities. Our working capital requirements have been, and we expect will continue to be, primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable. Factors impacting changes in accounts receivable could include changes in the prices at which we sell our methanol and ammonia and the timing of collections from customers. Factors impacting changes in accounts payable could include changes in the market prices of raw materials that we purchase in the normal course of business, the level of spending for capital expenditures and the timing of payments made to suppliers,. 
  Working capital at   September 30, 2016   was a deficit of $44.2 million, consisting of $43.9 million in total current assets and $88.1 million in total current liabilities. Working capital at   December 31, 2015   was a deficit of $16.5 million, consisting of $57.7 million in total current assets and $74.2 million in total current liabilities. The decrease in working capital as of   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and accounts receivable   related party caused from a decline in both methanol and ammonia average realized sales prices and an increase in short term borrowings.

CASH FLOWS 
  Our profits, operating cash flows and cash available for distribution are subject to changes in the prices of our products and natural gas, which is our primary feedstock. Our products and feedstocks are commodities and, as such, their prices can be volatile in response to numerous factors outside of our control. 
  The following table summarizes our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows: 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately $30.6 million. We had a net loss of approximately $33.2 for the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  . During this period, we recorded depreciation expense of $46.1 million and amortization of debt issuance costs of $3.1 million. Accounts receivable, which is approximately equal to one month of revenue, decreased by $5.7 million during the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  . The decrease in accounts receivable is due to a decrease in our average realized ammonia and methanol sales prices. Accounts receivable   related party decreased by $4.8 million due to the expiration of our sales agreement with OCI Fertilizers Trade   Supply B.V. Please read note 6   Related Party Transactions to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. Inventories decreased by $1.1 million due to an increase in sales volumes. Accounts payable   related party increased by $1.1 million due to expenses incurred under the Omnibus Agreement for reimbursement of providing selling, general, and administrative services and management and operating services to manage and operate our business. Please read note 6   Related Party Transactions to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. Other payables, accruals and current liabilities decreased by $0.9 million due to the payment of a long-term incentive bonus paid to all non-executive employees in January 2016. Please read note 8   Retention Bonus Plan to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $77.9 million. We had net income of approximately $37.5 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. During this period, we recorded depreciation expense of $34.3 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.7 million, a gain on the sale of scrap equipment of $2.0 million and a loss on the disposal of obsolete equipment of $2.0 million. Accounts receivable, which is approximately equal to one month of revenue, decreased by $10.1 million during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in accounts receivable is due to timing of receipt of cash from customers. Accounts receivable   related party increased by $1.3 million. Other current assets and prepaid expenses increased by $2.1 million due to the renewal of annual insurance policies that were amortized over the coverage period. Accounts payable (excluding non-cash accruals of property, plant and equipment) decreased by $2.1 million due to the settlement of obligations to our suppliers. Accounts payable   related party (excluding non-cash accruals of property, plant and equipment) increased by $2.1 million due to expenses incurred under the Omnibus Agreement for reimbursement of providing selling, general, and administrative services and management and operating services to manage and operate our business. Please read note 6   Related Party Transactions to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. Other payables, accruals and current liabilities (excluding non-cash accruals of property, plant and equipment) increased by $3.7 million due to a note payable related to the financing of certain insurance policies. Accrued interest (excluding capitalized interest) decreased by $8.0 million due to the capitalization of $8.6 million in interest expense in connection with the debottlenecking project.

Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $4.6 million and $219.1 million, respectively, for the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Net additions of property, plant, equipment and construction in progress were higher during the   nine-months ended September 30, 2015   as compared to the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016   due to expenditures associated with the debottlenecking project. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $28.0 million for the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   nine-months ended September 30, 2016  , we received $27.0 million in proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility and subsequently repaid $52.0 million, leaving no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. We received $39.2 million in proceeds from the Intercompany Revolving Facility and subsequently repaid $4.2 million, leaving $35.0 million outstanding under the Intercompany Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2016. We repaid borrowings of $3.4 million on the Term Loan B Credit Facility, paid cash distributions to unitholders of $33.1 and paid $1.2 million in deferred financing costs associated with Amendment No. 6 to the Term Loan B Credit Facility and Amendment No. 4 and 5 to the Revolving Credit Facility.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than SEC issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) to communicate changes to the codification. The Partnership considers the applicability and impact of all ASU s. The following are those ASU s that are relevant to the Partnership. 
  On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The FASB issued this ASU as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards and improve comparability between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and to align the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with IFRS, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A reporting entity can apply the amendments either prospectively or retrospectively, with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.  
  On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The FASB issued this ASU as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards and improve comparability between GAAP and IFRS. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 change the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. A reporting entity should apply the amendments prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.  
  On May 28, 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and permits the use of either retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Partnership is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Partnership has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Accuracy of estimates is based on the accuracy of information used. There has been no material change to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in our Annual Report.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Interest Rate Risk  . We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our borrowings. As of   September 30, 2016  , interest on borrowings under the Term Loan B Credit Facility accrued, at OCIB s option, at adjusted LIBOR plus 6.75% per annum or the alternate base rate plus 5.75%. Interest on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrued, at OCIB s option, at LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum or the alternate base rate plus 2.50%. Interest on borrowings under the Intercompany Revolving Facility will accrue at the rate equal to the sum of (a) the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (including as such per annum rate may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility), plus (b) 25 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the Intercompany Term Facility, will accrue at the rate equal to the sum of (a) the rate per annum applicable to the loans under the Term Loan B Credit Facility (including as such per annum rate may fluctuate from time to time in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan B Credit Facility), plus (b) 25 basis points. Based upon the outstanding balances of our variable-interest rate debt at   September 30, 2016  , and assuming interest rates are above the applicable minimum, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points would result in an increase or decrease to our annual interest expense of approximately $4.6 million. 
  Commodity Price Risk  . We are exposed to significant market risk due to potential changes in prices for methanol, ammonia and natural gas. Natural gas is the primary raw material used in the production of the methanol and ammonia manufactured at our facility. Operating at full capacity, our methanol and ammonia production units together require approximately 110,000 to 120,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas, as of   September 30, 2016  . We have supply agreements with Kinder Morgan, Florida Gas Transmission and Houston Pipeline to supply natural gas required for our production of methanol and ammonia. As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical increase or decrease of $1.00 per MMBtu of natural gas would result in an increase or decrease to our annual cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation) of approximately $40.2 million to $43.8 million. 
  In the normal course of business, we produce methanol and ammonia throughout the year to supply the needs of our customers. Our inventory is subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the price of methanol and ammonia, changes in demand, natural gas feedstock costs and other factors. Methanol prices have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, characterized by significant cyclicality. As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical increase or decrease of $50 per ton in the price of methanol would result in an increase or decrease to our annual revenue of approximately $45.6 million, based on an annual methanol volume of 912,500 metric tons. As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical increase or decrease of $50 per ton in the price of ammonia would result in an increase or decrease to our annual revenue of approximately $16.6 million, based on an annual ammonia volume of 331,000 metric tons. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  . We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and present fairly our financial results of operations.  
  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Applicable SEC rules require an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Thus, management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has found them to be effective in providing reasonable assurance of the timely recording, processing, summarization and reporting of information, and in accumulation and communication of information to management to allow for timely decisions with regard to required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  . There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

              (a)

              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
