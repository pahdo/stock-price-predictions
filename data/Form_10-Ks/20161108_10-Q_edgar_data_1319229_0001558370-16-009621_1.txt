(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

(a) Nature of business 

TransMontaigne Partners L.P. ( we,   us,   our,   the Partnership ) was formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. We provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for companies engaged in the trading, distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. We conduct our operations in the United States along the Gulf Coast, in the Midwest, in Houston and Brownsville, Texas, along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and in the Southeast.  

We are controlled by our general partner, TransMontaigne GP L.L.C. ( TransMontaigne GP ), which as of February 1, 2016 is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VI, L.P. ( ArcLight ). Prior to February 1, 2016, TransMontaigne LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NGL Energy Partners LP ( NGL ), owned all the issued and outstanding ownership interests of TransMontaigne GP.  

(b) Basis of presentation and use of estimates 

Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TransMontaigne Partners L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries. Investments where we do not have the ability to exercise control, but do have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  GAAP  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The following estimates, in management s opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment, and/or involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment and accrued environmental obligations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

(c) Accounting for terminal and pipeline operations 

In connection with our terminal and pipeline operations, we utilize the accrual method of accounting for revenue and expenses. We generate revenue in our terminal and pipeline operations from terminaling services fees, transportation fees, management fees and cost reimbursements, fees from other ancillary services and gains from the sale of refined products. Terminaling services revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement for storage fees and minimum revenue commitments that are fixed at the inception of the agreement and when product is delivered to the customer for fees based on a rate per barrel of throughput; transportation revenue is recognized when the product has been delivered to the customer at the specified delivery location; management fee revenue and cost reimbursements are recognized as the services are performed or as the costs are incurred; ancillary service revenue is recognized as the services are performed; and gains from the sale of refined products are recognized when the title to the product is transferred. 

Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with certain of our throughput customers, we are entitled to the volume of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities. Consistent with recognized industry practices, measurement differentials occur as the result of the inherent variances in measurement devices and methodology. We recognize as revenue the net proceeds from the sale of the product gained. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenue of   

8 

Table of Contents  

TransMontaigne Partners L.P. and subsidiaries 

Notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) (continued) 

approximately $1.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for net product gained. Within these amounts, approximately $nil and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were pursuant to terminaling services agreements with affiliate customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenue of approximately $4.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for net product gained. Within these amounts, approximately $0.3 million and $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were pursuant to terminaling services agreements with affiliate customers.      

(d) Cash and cash equivalents 

We consider all short term investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

(e) Property, plant and equipment 

Depreciation is computed using the straight line method. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. All items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures that increase capacity or extend useful lives are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 

We evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to that asset group. If an asset group is impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its estimated fair value. 

(f) Investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

We account for our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which we do not control but do have the ability to exercise significant influence over, using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is recorded at acquisition cost, increased by our proportionate share of any earnings and additional capital contributions and decreased by our proportionate share of any losses, distributions received and amortization of any excess investment. Excess investment is the amount by which our total investment exceeds our proportionate share of the book value of the net assets of the investment entity. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate there is a loss in value of the investment that is other than temporary. In the event of impairment, we would record a charge to earnings to adjust the carrying amount to fair value. 

(g) Environmental obligations 

We accrue for environmental costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations when probable and reasonably estimable (see Note 10 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). Environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites, costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated and ongoing monitoring costs, as well as fines, damages and other costs, including direct legal costs. Liabilities for environmental costs at a specific site are initially recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that we will be liable for such costs, and a reasonable estimate of the associated costs can be made based on available information. Such an estimate includes our share of the liability for each specific site and the sharing of the amounts related to each site that will not be paid by other potentially responsible parties, based on enacted laws and adopted regulations and policies. Adjustments to initial estimates are recorded, from time to time, to reflect changing circumstances and estimates based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods. Estimates of our ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes, alternatives available and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations. We periodically file claims for insurance recoveries of certain environmental remediation costs with our insurance carriers under our comprehensive liability policies (see Note 5 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).

Table of Contents  

TransMontaigne Partners L.P. and subsidiaries 

Notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) (continued) 

We recognize our insurance recoveries as a credit to income in the period that we assess the likelihood of recovery as being probable (i.e., likely to occur).  

In connection with our previous acquisitions of certain terminals from TransMontaigne LLC, TransMontaigne LLC has agreed to indemnify us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses at those terminals (see Note 2 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). 

(h) Asset retirement obligations 

Asset retirement obligations are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the asset. Generally accepted accounting principles require that the fair value of a liability related to the retirement of long lived assets be recorded at the time a legal obligation is incurred. Once an asset retirement obligation is identified and a liability is recorded, a corresponding asset is recorded, which is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. After the initial measurement, the liability is adjusted to reflect changes in the asset retirement obligation. If and when it is determined that a legal obligation has been incurred, the fair value of any liability is determined based on estimates and assumptions related to retirement costs, future inflation rates and interest rates. Our long lived assets consist of above ground storage facilities and underground pipelines. We are unable to predict if and when these long lived assets will become completely obsolete and require dismantlement. We have not recorded an asset retirement obligation, or corresponding asset, because the future dismantlement and removal dates of our long lived assets is indeterminable and the amount of any associated costs are believed to be insignificant. Changes in our assumptions and estimates may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. 

(i) Equity based compensation 

Generally accepted accounting principles require us to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the measurement date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized during the period services are provided in exchange for the award (see Note 14 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). 

(j) Accounting for derivative instruments 

Generally accepted accounting principles require us to recognize all derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities (see Note 11 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our derivative instruments were limited to interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $125.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. Our derivative instruments at September 30, 2016 expire between March 25, 2018 and March 11, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we pay a blended fixed rate of approximately 1.01% and receive interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR. The net difference to be paid or received under the interest rate swap agreements is settled monthly and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using a pricing model based on the LIBOR swap rate and other observable market data. 

(k) Income taxes 

No provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, all income, gains, losses, expenses, deductions and tax credits generated by us flow through to our unitholders.

(l) Net earnings per limited partner unit 

Net earnings allocable to the limited partners, for purposes of calculating net earnings per limited partner unit, are net of the earnings allocable to the general partner interest and distributions payable to any restricted phantom units granted under our equity based compensation plans that participate in our distributions (see Note 15 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). The earnings allocable to the general partner interest include the distributions of available cash (as defined by our partnership agreement) attributable to the period to the general partner interest, net of adjustments for the general partner s share of undistributed earnings, and the incentive distribution rights. Undistributed earnings are the difference between the earnings and the distributions attributable to the period. Undistributed earnings are allocated to the limited partners and general partner interest based on their respective sharing of earnings or losses specified in the partnership agreement, which is based on their ownership percentages of 98% and 2%, respectively. The incentive distribution rights are not allocated a portion of the undistributed earnings given they are not entitled to distributions other than from available cash. Further, the incentive distribution rights do not share in losses under our partnership agreement. Basic net earnings per limited partner unit is computed by dividing net earnings allocable to limited partners by the weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per limited partner unit is computed by dividing net earnings allocable to the limited partners by the weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding during the period and any potential dilutive securities outstanding during the period. 

(m) Recent accounting pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The objective of this update is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption will have on our disclosures and financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal Versus Agent Considerations  , as further clarification on principal versus agent considerations.   ASU 2016-08 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption will have on our disclosures and financial statements.  

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   as further clarification on identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance.   ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption will have on our disclosures and financial statements.  

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ,     as clarifying guidance on specific narrow scope improvements and practical expedients.   ASU 2016-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption will have on our disclosures and financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases.   The objective of this update is to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.

(2) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES 

Omnibus agreement.      On May 27, 2005 we entered into an omnibus agreement with TransMontaigne LLC and our general partner, which agreement has been subsequently amended from time to time. In connection with the ArcLight acquisition of our general partner, effective February 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement to   consent to the assignment of the omnibus agreement from TransMontaigne LLC to Gulf TLP Holdings LLC  , an ArcLight subsidiary,   and to waive the automatic termination that would have occurred at such time as TransMontaigne LLC ceased to control our general partner.   The omnibus agreement will continue in effect until the earlier to occur of (i) the owner ceasing to control our general partner or (ii) the election of either us or the owner, following at least 24 months  prior written notice to the other parties. 

Under the omnibus agreement we pay the owner of TransMontaigne GP an administrative fee for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit. The administrative fee paid for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $2.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the administrative fee paid was approximately $8.5 million and $8.4 million, respectively. If we acquire or construct additional facilities, the owner of TransMontaigne GP may propose a revised administrative fee covering the provision of services for such additional facilities, subject to approval by the conflicts committee of our general partner. The administrative fee encompasses the reimbursement of services to perform centralized corporate functions, such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes, engineering and other corporate services. 

The omnibus agreement further provides that we pay the owner of TransMontaigne GP an insurance reimbursement for insurance policies purchased on our behalf to cover our facilities and operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the insurance reimbursement paid was approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the insurance reimbursement paid was approximately $2.8 million. We also reimburse the owner of TransMontaigne GP for direct operating costs and expenses, such as salaries of operational personnel performing services on site at our terminals and pipelines and the cost of their employee benefits, including 401(k) and health insurance benefits. 

Prior to March 1, 2016, under the omnibus agreement we agreed to reimburse the owner of TransMontaigne GP for a portion of the incentive bonus awards made to key employees under the owner s savings and retention program, provided the compensation committee of our general partner determined that an adequate portion of the incentive bonus awards were indexed to the performance of our common units in the form of restricted phantom units. The value of our incentive bonus award reimbursement for a single grant year could be no less than $1.5 million. Effective April 13, 2015 and for the 2015 incentive bonus award, we have the option to provide the reimbursement in either a cash payment or the delivery of our common units to the owner of TransMontaigne GP or directly to the award recipients, with the reimbursement made in accordance with the underlying vesting and payment schedule of the savings and retention program. Prior to the 2015 incentive bonus award, we reimbursed our portion of the incentive bonus awards by making cash payments to the owner of TransMontaigne GP over the first year that each applicable award was granted. Under the amended and restated omnibus agreement entered into on March 1, 2016, we have agreed to satisfy the incentive bonus awards made to key employees under the savings and retention program, including awards granted in 2016, in either cash or in common units; provided the compensation committee and conflicts committee of our general partner approves the annual awards granted under the plan. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the expense associated with the reimbursement of incentive bonus awards was approximately $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the expense associated with the reimbursement of incentive bonus awards was approximately $2.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively.  

Environmental indemnification.    In connection with our acquisition of the Florida and Midwest terminals on May 27, 2005, TransMontaigne LLC agreed to indemnify us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses that were identified on or before May 27, 2010, and that were associated with the ownership or operation of the Florida and Midwest terminals prior to May 27, 2005. TransMontaigne LLC s maximum liability for this indemnification obligation is $15.0 million. TransMontaigne LLC has no obligation to indemnify us for losses until such aggregate losses exceed $250,000. TransMontaigne LLC has no indemnification obligations with respect to

In connection with our acquisition of the Brownsville, Texas and River terminals on December 31, 2006, TransMontaigne LLC agreed to indemnify us against potential environmental claims, losses and expenses that were identified on or before December 31, 2011, and that were associated with the ownership or operation of the Brownsville and River facilities prior to December 31, 2006. TransMontaigne LLC s maximum liability for this indemnification obligation is $15.0 million. TransMontaigne LLC has no obligation to indemnify us for losses until such aggregate losses exceed $250,000. The deductible amount, cap amount and limitation of time for indemnification do not apply to any environmental liabilities known to exist as of December 31, 2006. TransMontaigne LLC has no indemnification obligations with respect to environmental claims made as a result of additions to or modifications of environmental laws promulgated after December 31, 2006. 

In connection with our acquisition of the Southeast terminals on December 31, 2007, TransMontaigne LLC agreed to indemnify us against potential environmental claims, losses and expenses that were identified on or before December 31, 2012, and that were associated with the ownership or operation of the Southeast terminals prior to December 31, 2007. TransMontaigne LLC s maximum liability for this indemnification obligation is $15.0 million. TransMontaigne LLC has no obligation to indemnify us for losses until such aggregate losses exceed $250,000. The deductible amount, cap amount and limitation of time for indemnification do not apply to any environmental liabilities known to exist as of December 31, 2007.

The forgoing environmental indemnification obligations of TransMontaigne LLC to us remain in place and were not affected by ArcLight s acquisition of our general partner.  

Terminaling services agreement Southeast terminals.    In connection with the   ArcLight acquisition   of our general partner, our Southeast terminaling services agreement with NGL was amended to extend the term of the agreement through July 31, 2040 at the prevailing contract rate terms contained within the agreement. Subsequent to January 31, 2023, NGL has the ability to terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 24 months  prior notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. Subsequent to the ArcLight acquisition, effective February 1, 2016, revenue associated with the Southeast terminaling services agreement is recorded as revenue from external customers as opposed to revenue from affiliates. 

Under this agreement, NGL was obligated to throughput a volume of refined product that, at the fee schedule contained in the agreement, resulted in minimum throughput payments to us of approximately $6.8 million and $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $20.3 million and $20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The agreement contains stipulated annual increases in throughput payments based on increases in the United States Consumer Price Index. The minimum annual throughput payment is reduced proportionately for any decrease in storage capacity due to out of service tank capacity.    

Under this agreement, we agreed to rebate NGL 50% of the proceeds we receive annually in excess of $4.2 million from the sale of product gains at our Southeast terminals. The proceeds from the sale of product gains at our Southeast terminals did not exceed $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, nor are they expected to exceed

TransMontaigne Partners L.P. and subsidiaries 

Notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) (continued) 

this amount for the year ending December 31, 2016. Accordingly, we have not accrued a liability for a rebate at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

If a force majeure event occurs that renders us unable to perform our obligations with respect to an asset, the obligations would be temporarily suspended with respect to that asset. If a force majeure event continues for 30 consecutive days or more and results in a diminution in the storage capacity we make available, the counterparty may terminate its obligations with respect to the asset affected by the force majeure event and their minimum revenue commitment would be reduced proportionately for the duration of the agreement. 

Terminaling services agreement Florida terminals  . On October 31, 2014, NGL provided us the required 18 months  prior notice that it would terminate its remaining obligations under the Florida terminaling services agreement effective April 30, 2016, which constitutes NGL s light oil terminaling capacity for approximately 1.1 million barrels at our Port Everglades North, Florida terminal. On April 30, 2016, NGL amended the agreement to retain approximately 0.1 million barrels of this capacity. As of July 15, 2016 we have re-contracted the remaining capacity to third party customers at similar rates charged to NGL.  

Under this agreement, NGL was obligated to throughput a volume that, at the fee and tariff schedule contained in the agreement, resulted in minimum throughput payments to us of approximately $0.1 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.6 million and $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Operations and reimbursement agreement Frontera.    We have a 50% ownership interest in Frontera Brownsville LLC joint venture, or  Frontera . We have agreed to operate Frontera, in accordance with an operations and reimbursement agreement executed between us and Frontera, for a management fee that is based on our costs incurred. Our agreement with Frontera stipulates that we may resign as the operator at any time with the prior written consent of Frontera, or that we may be removed as the operator for good cause, which includes material noncompliance with laws and material failure to adhere to good industry practice regarding health, safety or environmental matters. We recognized revenue related to this operations and reimbursement agreement of approximately $1.2 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.8 million and $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

(3) ACQUISITION OF TERMINAL ASSETS 

Effective January 28, 2016, we acquired from TransMontaigne LLC its Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system for a cash payment of $12.0 million. The hydrant system encompasses a system for fueling cruise ships and is currently under contract with one of our existing terminal customers for approximately three more years. The acquisition of the hydrant system from TransMontaigne LLC has been recorded at the carryover basis in a manner similar to a reorganization of entities under common control. As TransMontaigne LLC controlled our general partner on the acquisition date, the difference between the consideration we paid to TransMontaigne LLC and the carryover basis of the net assets purchased has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statement of partners  equity as a decrease to the general partner s interest. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the hydrant system from January 28, 2016. As this transaction is not considered material to our consolidated financial statements we did not recast prior period consolidated financial statements. 

(4) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

Our primary market areas are located in the United States along the Gulf Coast, in the Southeast, in Brownsville, Texas, along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, and in the Midwest. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from companies engaged in the trading, distribution and marketing of refined products and crude oil. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. Our customers  historical financial and operating information is analyzed prior to extending credit. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit

limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees. We maintain allowances for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable. 

Trade accounts receivable, net consists of the following (in thousands): 

The following customers accounted for at least 10% of our consolidated revenue in at least one of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations: 

On October 27, 2015, upon the sale of Morgan Stanley s global physical oil merchanting business to Castleton Commodities International LLC, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, with our consent, assigned all its terminaling services agreements with us to Castleton Commodities International LLC. 

(5) OTHER CURRENT ASSETS 

Other current assets are as follows (in thousands): 

Amounts due from insurance companies.    We periodically file claims for recovery of environmental remediation costs with our insurance carriers under our comprehensive liability policies. We recognize our insurance recoveries in the period that we assess the likelihood of recovery as being probable (i.e., likely to occur). At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have recognized amounts due from insurance companies of approximately $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, representing our best estimate of our probable insurance recoveries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received reimbursements from insurance companies of approximately $0.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased our estimate of probable future insurance recoveries by approximately $1.3 million.

Property, plant and equipment, net is as follows (in thousands): 

(7) GOODWILL 

Goodwill is as follows (in thousands): 

Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually unless events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred at an interim date. Our annual test for the impairment of goodwill is performed as of December 31. The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are our operating segments (see Note 18 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). The fair value of each reporting unit is determined on a stand alone basis from the perspective of a market participant and represents an estimate of the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our only reporting unit that contained goodwill was our Brownsville terminals. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or during the year ended December 31, 2015 for this reporting unit. However, a significant decline in the price of our common units with a resulting increase in the assumed market participants  weighted average cost of capital, the loss of a significant customer, the disposition of significant assets, or an unforeseen increase in the costs to operate and maintain the Brownsville terminals, could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future. 

(8) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC ( BOSTCO ) and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera Brownsville LLC ( Frontera ). BOSTCO is a terminal facility located on the Houston Ship Channel that encompasses approximately 7.1 million barrels of distillate, residual and other black oil product storage. Class A and Class B ownership interests share in cash distributions on a 96.5% and 3.5% basis, respectively. Class B ownership interests do not have voting rights and are not required to make capital investments. Frontera is a terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas that encompasses approximately 1.5 million barrels of light petroleum product storage, as well as related ancillary facilities.

(12) LONG TERM DEBT 

On March 9, 2011, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility, or  credit facility , which has been subsequently amended from time to time. At September 30, 2016, the credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to the lesser of (i) $400 million and (ii) 4.75 times Consolidated EBITDA (as defined: $447.1 million at September 30, 2016). At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $100 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of the credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our  available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of  permitted acquisitions   other investments  which may not exceed 5% of  consolidated net tangible assets  and additional future  permitted JV investments  up to $125 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, July 31, 2018. 

We may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2% to 3% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 1% to 2% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was approximately 3.2% and 2.6%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was approximately 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were $270.3 million and $248.0 million, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our outstanding letters of credit were $0.4 million and $nil, respectively.

(13) PARTNERS  EQUITY 

The number of units outstanding is as follows: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, common units outstanding include nil and 8,018 common units, respectively, held on behalf of TransMontaigne LLC s long term incentive plan. In connection with the ArcLight acquisition of our general partner, effective February 1, 2016, 15,750 restricted phantom units previously granted to the independent directors vested and were satisfied via the delivery of our common units. 

(14) EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION 

TransMontaigne GP is our general partner and manages our operations and activities. Prior to February 1, 2016, TransMontaigne GP was a wholly owned subsidiary of TransMontaigne LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of NGL. TransMontaigne Services LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of TransMontaigne LLC, had a long term incentive plan and a savings and retention program to compensate through incentive bonus awards certain employees and independent directors of our general partner who provided services with respect to the business of our general partner.  

Long-term incentive plan.      On February 26, 2016, the board of our general partner approved, subject to the approval of our unitholders, the TLP Management Services LLC 2016 long-term incentive plan and the TLP Management Services LLC savings and retention program (discussed further below) which constitutes a program under, and is subject to, the 2016 long-term incentive plan, which replaced the TransMontaigne Services LLC long-term incentive plan and the TransMontaigne Services savings and retention program. TLP Management Services LLC is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ArcLight. On July 12, 2016, we held a special meeting of unitholders at which time the 2016 long-term incentive plan was approved by our unitholders. 

The 2016 long-term incentive plan operates in a manner similar to the TransMontaigne Services LLC long-term incentive plan used previously. The 2016 long-term incentive plan reserves 750,000 common units to be granted as awards under the plan, with such amount subject to adjustment as provided for under the terms of the plan if there is a change in our common units, such as a unit split or other reorganization. The common units authorized to be granted under the 2016 long-term incentive plan are registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8. 

The 2016 long term incentive plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors of our general partner and is primarily used for grants of restricted phantom units to the independent directors of our general partner. The grants to the independent directors of our general partner have historically vested and were payable annually in equal tranches over a four-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control of

TransMontaigne GP. Ownership in the awards is subject to forfeiture until the vesting date, but recipients have distribution and voting rights from the date of the grant.  

In connection with the ArcLight acquisition of our general partner, effective February 1, 2016, all of the restricted phantom units previously granted to the independent directors vested and were satisfied via the delivery of our common units. 

TransMontaigne GP had historically acquired outstanding common units on the open market under a purchase program for purposes of delivering vested units to the independent directors of our general partner. The purchase program concluded with its final purchase of 667 units on the program s scheduled termination date of April 1, 2015. Future grants of restricted phantom units under the 2016 long term incentive plan are expected to be settled by us through the issuance of common units pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-8.  

Activity under the long-term incentive plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Generally accepted accounting principles require us to measure the cost of board member services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the vesting period on a straight line basis during which a board member is required to provide services in exchange for the award with the costs being accelerated upon the occurrence of accelerated vesting events, such as a change in control of our general partner. In connection with the ArcLight acquisition of our general partner, effective February 1, 2016, 15,750 restricted phantom units previously granted to the independent directors vested and were satisfied via the delivery of our common units. For awards to the independent directors of our general partner, equity based compensation of approximately $520,000 and $70,000 is included in direct general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively 

Savings and retention program.    On February 26, 2016, the board of our general partner unanimously approved the new   TLP Management Services LLC   savings and retention program  ,   subject to the approval of our unitholders,   for employees who provide services with respect to our business  .  This plan is intended to constitute a program under, and be subject to, the   TLP Management Services LLC   2016 long-term incentive plan described above.     On July 12, 2016, we held a special meeting of unitholders at which time our unitholders approved the 2016 long-term incentive plan and savings and retention program.    The new savings and retention program was used for incentive bonus awards in March 2016 and is intended to be used for future awards to employees.  The new savings and retention program operates in a manner substantially similar to the   TransMontaigne Services LLC savings and retention program used previously.   

Ownership in the restricted phantom units under the savings and retention program is subject to forfeiture until the vesting date, but recipients have distribution equivalent rights from the date of grant that accrue additional restricted phantom units equivalent to the value of quarterly distributions paid by us on each of our outstanding common units. Recipients of restricted phantom units under the savings and retention program do not have voting rights.  

The purpose of the savings and retention program is to provide for the reward and retention of participants by providing them with bonus awards that vest over future service periods. Awards under the plan generally become vested and payable as to 50% of a participant s annual award as of the first day of the month that falls closest to the second anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining 50% as of the first day of the month that falls closest to the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to earlier vesting upon a participant s attainment of the age and length of service thresholds, retirement, death or disability, involuntary termination without cause, or termination of a participant s

employment following a change in control of the Partnership, our general partner or TLP Management Services LLC, as specified in the plan.     

A person will satisfy the age and length of service thresholds of the plan upon the attainment of the earliest of (a) age sixty, (b) age fifty five and ten years of service as an officer of TLP Management Services LLC or any of its affiliates or predecessors, or (c) age fifty and twenty years of service as an employee of TLP Management Services LLC or any of its affiliates or predecessors. 

Effective April 13, 2015 and beginning with the 2015 incentive bonus award and continuing under the new savings and retention program, under the omnibus agreement we have the option to provide the reimbursement in either a cash payment or the delivery of our common units to the savings and retention program or alternatively directly to the award recipients, with the reimbursement made in accordance with the underlying vesting and payment schedule of the savings and retention program. Our reimbursement for the 2015 and 2016 incentive bonus awards is reduced for forfeitures and is increased for the value of quarterly distributions accrued under the distribution equivalent rights. We have the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the 2015 and 2016 incentive bonus awards in our common units, and accordingly, effective April 13, 2015, we began accounting for the 2015 incentive bonus award as an equity award. Prior to the 2015 incentive bonus award, we reimbursed our portion of the incentive bonus awards through monthly cash payments to the savings and retention program over the first year that each applicable award was granted.  

For certain senior level employees, including the executive officers of our general partner, all prior grants under the TransMontaigne Services LLC savings and retention program vested upon the change in control of our general partner as a result of the ArcLight acquisition that occurred on February 1, 2016.  

Given that we do not have any employees to provide corporate and support services and instead we contract for such services under the omnibus agreement, generally accepted accounting principles require us to classify the savings and retention program awards as a non-employee award and measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the vesting date fair value of the award. That cost, or an estimate of that cost in the case of unvested restricted phantom units, is recognized over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the expense associated with the reimbursement of incentive bonus awards was approximately $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the expense associated with the reimbursement of incentive bonus awards was approximately $2.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. 

Activity related to our equity based awards granted under the savings and retention program for services performed under the omnibus agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:

(17) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE 

GAAP  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Generally accepted accounting principles also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of higher level inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1 inputs, which are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; (2) Level 2 inputs, which are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and (3) Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 

The fair values of the following financial instruments represent our best estimate of the amounts that would be received to sell those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at that date. Our fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects our judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Cash equivalents.    The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short term maturity of these instruments. The fair value is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative instruments.    The carrying amount of our interest rate swaps was determined using a pricing model based on the LIBOR swap rate and other observable market data. The fair value is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  

Debt.    The carrying amount of our credit facility debt approximates fair value since borrowings under the facility bear interest at current market interest rates. The fair value is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Fourth consecutive increase in quarterly distribution.      On October  17, 2016, we announced a quarterly distribution of $0.70 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This $0.01 increase over the previous quarter reflects the fourth consecutive increase in our distribution and represents annual growth of 5.3% over the prior year. This distribution was paid on November 7, 2016 to unitholders of record on October 31, 2016. 

Expansion of the Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal.      We previously entered into long-term terminaling services agreements with various parties for approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. The revenue associated with these agreements will come on-line upon completion of the construction of the new tank capacity, which remains on target for completion during the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017. The anticipated cost of the new storage capacity is approximately $75 million, with expected annual cash returns in the high-teens. Construction of the Collins/Purvis expansion project commenced in the first quarter of 2016 and we have spent approximately $30.4 million as of September 30, 2016. Our Collins/Purvis terminal is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined petroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. Our facility has current active storage capacity of approximately 3.4 million barrels and is expected to increase to 5.4 million barrels once the 2.0 million barrel expansion is completed. We have also begun the process of permitting an additional 5.0 million barrels of additional capacity at our at our Collins/Purvis terminal and are in active discussions with several potential customers regarding this potential future capacity. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

A summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, filed on March 10, 2016. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management s opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment, and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment and accrued environmental obligations. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Terminaling services fees.    Pursuant to terminaling services agreements with our customers, which range from one month to approximately ten years in duration, we generate fees by distributing and storing products for our customers. Terminaling services fees include throughput fees based on the volume of product distributed from the facility, injection fees based on the volume of product injected with additive compounds and storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month. The terminaling services fees by business segments were as follows (in thousands): 

Terminaling Services Fees by Business Segment 

The increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals includes an increase of approximately $1.2 million resulting from us entering into a new five year agreement with a third party customer for approximately 2.7 million barrels of existing capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal, commencing January 1, 2016. The new agreement replaced the previous agreement we had with the third party customer for this tankage and contains an increase to the minimum throughput fees. The new agreement is anticipated to generate additional minimum throughput revenue in excess of $4.1 million annually.   

Included in terminaling services fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $0.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. 

Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Most of our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to throughput a minimum volume of product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time, which results in a minimum amount of revenue. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity made available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a minimum amount of revenue. We refer to these minimum amounts of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being  firm commitments.  Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as  variable.  The  firm commitments  and  variable  revenue included in terminaling services fees were as follows (in thousands):

We expect to initially fund any investments, capital projects and future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities with undistributed cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our credit facility. After initially funding expenditures with borrowings under our credit facility, we may raise funds through additional equity offerings and debt financings. The proceeds of such equity offerings and debt financings may then be used to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.

Our share of the gain in the prior year was approximately $3.4 million, which we received in cash as a component of our third quarter 2015 distribution from BOSTCO. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by the timing of working capital requirements and increased net margins.     

The increase in net cash used in investing activities includes an increase of $12.0 million for the acquisition of the Port Everglades, Florida hydrant system and an increase of approximately $9.6 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to construction of approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis, Mississippi bulk storage terminal. Management and the board of directors of our general partner have approved additional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the fourth quarter of 2017. At September 30, 2016, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $50 million, which primarily relates to the remaining construction costs associated with the approximately 2.0 million barrels of new storage capacity at our Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal.   

The decrease in net cash used in financing activities includes an increase of $24.7 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to help fund the increase in investing activities.

Amended and restated senior secured credit facility.    On March 9, 2011, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility, or  credit facility , which has been subsequently amended from time to time. The credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to the lesser of (i) $400 million and (ii) 4.75 times Consolidated EBITDA (as defined: $447.1 million at September 30, 2016). At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $100 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of the credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our  available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of  permitted acquisitions   other investments  which may not exceed 5% of  consolidated net tangible assets  and additional future  permitted JV investments  up to $125 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, July 31, 2018. 

We may elect to have loans under the credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2% to 3% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 1% to 2% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At September 30, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were $270.3 million. 

The credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and customary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in the credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 4.75 times), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 times) in the event we issue senior unsecured notes, and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 times). These financial covenants are based on a defined financial performance measure within the credit facility known as  Consolidated EBITDA.  The calculation of the  total leverage ratio  and  interest coverage ratio  contained in the credit facility is as follows (in thousands, except ratios):  

(1)  Consolidated interest expense, used in the calculation of the interest coverage ratio, excludes unrealized gains and losses recognized on our derivative instruments.

If we were to fail either financial performance covenant, or any other covenant contained in the credit facility, we would seek a waiver from our lenders under such facility. If we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders and the default remained uncured after any applicable grace period, we would be in breach of the credit facility, and the lenders would be entitled to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable. 

Common unit offering     program.    On September 2, 2016,   the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a new shelf registration statement, which replaced our prior shelf registration statement that previously expired. As with the prior shelf registration statement, the new shelf registration statement allows us to issue common units and debt securities.    In connection with the shelf registration statement, we established a common unit offering program under which we may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of $50 million.    We intend to use the net proceeds from any equity sales pursuant to the common unit offering program, after deducting the agent s commissions and the Partnership s offering expenses, for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, repayment of indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital or acquisitions.  To date we have issued no common units or debt securities under the common unit offering program or the registration statement. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

The information contained in this Item 3 updates, and should be read in conjunction with, information set forth in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10 K, filed on March 10, 2016, in addition to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presented in Part 1, Items 1 and 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. There are no material changes in the market risks faced by us from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. A principal market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our credit facility. Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the lender s base rate.  We manage a portion of our interest rate risk with interest rate swaps, which reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by converting variable interest rates to fixed interest rates. At September 30, 2016, we are party to interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $125.0 million that expire between March 25, 2018 and March 11, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we pay a blended fixed rate of approximately 1.01% and receive interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR. The net difference to be paid or received under the interest rate swap agreements is settled monthly and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $270.3 million under our credit facility. Based on the outstanding balance of our variable interest rate debt at September 30, 2016, the terms of our interest rate swap agreements and assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the potential annual increase or decrease in interest expense is approximately $1.5 million. 

We do not purchase or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we do not have material direct exposure to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage the commodity risk associated with the product we may own at any given time. Generally, to the extent we are entitled to retain product pursuant to terminaling services agreements with our customers, we sell the product to our customers on a contractually established periodic basis; the sales price is based on industry indices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we sold approximately 77,650 and 86,000 barrels, respectively, of product gained resulting from differences in the measurement of product volumes received and distributed at our terminaling facilities at average prices of approximately $54 and $68 per barrel, respectively. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the management of our general partner, including our general partner s principal executive and principal financial officer (whom we refer to as   

44 

Table of Contents  

the Certifying Officers), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The management of our general partner evaluated, with the participation of the Certifying Officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, pursuant to Rule 13a 15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

See Part I, Item 1 Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements entitled  Legal Proceedings  which is incorporated into this item by reference.    

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS   

The following risk factors, discussed in more detail below and in  Item 1A. Risk Factors,  in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, filed on March 10, 2016, are expressly incorporated into this report by reference, are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and may adversely affect our business and results of operations, include, but are not limited to:  

whether we are able to generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to maintain or grow the amount of the quarterly distribution to our unitholders;     

Gulf TLP Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VI, L.P.  ,   controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations.   ArcLight and its affiliates   have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests to our detriment;     

affiliates of our general partner, including Gulf TLP Holdings, LLC and ArcLight, may compete with us and do not have any obligation to present business opportunities to us;     

failure by any of our significant customers to continue to engage us to provide services after the expiration of existing terminaling services agreements or our failure to secure comparable alternative arrangements;     

a reduction in revenue from any of our significant customers upon which we rely for a substantial majority of our revenue;     

a material portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, over which we do not maintain full control and which have unique risks;     

competition from other terminals and pipelines that may be able to supply our significant customers with terminaling services on a more competitive basis;     

the continued creditworthiness of, and performance by, our significant customers;     

the expiration of the omnibus agreement occurs on the earlier to occur of ArcLight ceasing to control our general partner or following at least 24 months prior written notice;     

we are exposed to the credit risks of our significant customers which could affect our creditworthiness. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by such customers could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;     

a lack of access to new capital would impair our ability to expand our operations;     

45 

Table of Contents  

the lack of availability of acquisition opportunities, constraints on our ability to make acquisitions, failure to successfully integrate acquired facilities and future performance of acquired facilities, could limit our ability to grow our business successfully and could adversely affect the price of our common units;     

a decrease in demand for products due to high prices, alternative fuel sources, new technologies or adverse economic conditions;     

our debt levels and restrictions in our debt agreements that may limit our operational flexibility;     

the ability of our significant customers to secure financing arrangements adequate to purchase their desired volume of product;     

the impact on our facilities or operations of extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, and other events, such as terrorist attacks or war and costs associated with environmental compliance and remediation;     

the control of our general partner being transferred to a third party without our consent or unitholder consent;     

we may have to refinance our existing debt in unfavorable market conditions;     

the failure of our existing and future insurance policies to fully cover all risks incident to our business;     

cyber attacks or other breaches of our information security measures could disrupt our operations and result in increased costs;     

timing, cost and other economic uncertainties related to the construction of new tank capacity or facilities;     

the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations, general economic, market or business conditions;     

the age and condition of many of our pipeline and storage assets may result in increased maintenance and remediation expenditures;     

cost reimbursements, which are determined by our general partner, and fees paid to our general partner and its affiliates for services will continue to be substantial;     

our general partner s limited call right may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price;     

our ability to issue additional units without unitholders  approval would dilute unitholders  existing ownership interest;     

the possibility that our unitholders could be held liable under some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner;     

our failure to avoid federal income taxation as a corporation or the imposition of state level taxation;     

our inability to make acquisitions and investments to increase our capital asset base may result in future declines in our tax depreciation;     

the impact of new IRS regulations or a challenge of our current allocation of income, gain, loss and deductions among our unitholders;     

46 

Table of Contents  

unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their respective share of our taxable income regardless of the amount of cash distributions;     

investment in common partnership units by tax exempt entities and non United States persons raises tax issues unique to them;     

unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our units; and     

the sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests within a 12 month period would result in a deemed technical termination of our partnership for income tax purposes.     

There have been no material changes from risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 10, 2016.
