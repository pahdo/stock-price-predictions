  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1.   Basis of Presentation 
  Nature of Operations 
  Carrizo Oil   Gas, Inc. is a Houston-based energy company which, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ), is actively engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas primarily from resource plays located in the United States. The Company s current operations are principally focused in proven, producing oil and gas plays primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, the Delaware Basin in West Texas, the Niobrara Formation in Colorado, the Utica Shale in Ohio, and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. 
  Consolidated Financial Statements 
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and therefore do not include all disclosures required for financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ). In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s interim financial position, results of operations and cash flows. However, the results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the full year. These financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( 2015 Annual Report ). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no material impact on prior period amounts.  
   
  2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  The Company has provided a discussion of significant accounting policies, estimates, and judgments in  Note   2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in its 2015 Annual Report. There have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies since   December 31, 2015  , other than the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, be classified in the balance sheet as noncurrent. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 which was applied prospectively and therefore the adoption had no impact on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by presenting such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt rather than as an asset. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-15 ), which allows debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit agreements to be deferred and presented as an asset in the balance sheet, subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 and reclassified   $19.7 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Company s senior notes from long-term assets to long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Debt issuance costs associated with the Company s revolving credit facility remain classified as a long-term asset in the consolidated balance sheets. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues for which current GAAP is either unclear or does not include specific guidance. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, provided that it is adopted in its entirety in the same period. The Company is evaluating ASU 2016-15 to determine what impact adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  
   -  5  - 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which amends certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment arrangements. ASU 2016-09 revises or provides alternative accounting for the tax impacts of share-based payment arrangements, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholdings, and prescribes certain disclosures to be made in the period of adoption. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating ASU 2016-09 to determine what impact adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which significantly changes accounting for leases by requiring that lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments, for virtually all lease transactions. Additional disclosures about an entity s lease transactions will also be required. ASU 2016-02 defines a lease as  a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating ASU 2016-02 to determine what impact adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which will require entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will supersede most current guidance related to revenue recognition when it becomes effective. The new standard also will require expanded disclosures regarding the nature, timing, amount and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016. Companies are permitted to adopt ASU 2014-09 through the use of either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company does not currently intend to early-adopt ASU 2014-09 and has not determined which transition method it will use. The Company is evaluating ASU 2014-09 to determine what impact adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
  3.   Property and Equipment, Net 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total property and equipment, net consisted of the following: 

Average depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) per Boe of proved properties was   $12.72   and   $24.19   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $13.79   and   $23.82   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company capitalized internal costs of employee compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, directly associated with acquisition, exploration and development activities totaling   $2.7 million   and   $3.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $8.5 million   and   $14.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Unproved properties, not being amortized, include unevaluated leasehold and seismic costs associated with specific unevaluated properties, the cost of exploratory wells in progress and related capitalized interest. The Company capitalized interest costs associated with its unevaluated leasehold and seismic costs and exploratory well costs totaling   $2.9 million   and   $7.5 million   for  
  
   -  6  - 

the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $13.4 million   and   $26.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Impairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties 
  At the end of each quarter, the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, are limited to the  cost center ceiling  equal to (i) the sum of (A) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of   10%  , (B) the costs of unproved properties not being amortized, and (C) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized; less (ii) related income tax effects. Any excess of the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, over the cost center ceiling is recognized as an impairment of proved oil and gas properties. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher commodity prices in the future result in a cost center ceiling in excess of the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes. 
  The estimated future net revenues used in the cost center ceiling are calculated using the average realized prices for sales of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas on the first calendar day of each month during the 12-month period prior to the end of the current quarter ( 12-Month Average Realized Price ), held flat for the life of the production, except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Prices do not include the impact of derivative instruments as the Company elected not to meet the criteria to qualify derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment. 
  Primarily due to declines in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil, the Company recognized impairments of proved oil and gas properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as summarized in the table below:  

The Company's estimated range of the fourth quarter cost center ceiling, at the high end, would exceed the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, and at the low end, would result in an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   $50.0 million  . This estimated range of the fourth quarter cost center ceiling is based on the estimated 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil of   $39.26   per barrel as of   December 31, 2016  , which is based on the average realized price for sales of crude oil on the first calendar day of each month for the first 11 months and an estimate for the twelfth month based on a quoted forward price. Declines in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil in subsequent quarters would result in a lower present value of the estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves and may result in additional impairments of proved oil and gas properties. 
   
  4.   Income Taxes 
  The Company s estimated annual effective income tax rates are used to allocate expected annual income tax expense or benefit to interim periods. The rates are the ratio of estimated annual income tax expense or benefit to estimated annual income or loss before income taxes by taxing jurisdiction, except for discrete items, which are significant, unusual or infrequent items for which income taxes are computed and recorded in the interim period in which the discrete item occurs. The estimated annual effective income tax rates are applied to the year-to-date income or loss before income taxes by taxing jurisdiction to determine the income tax expense or benefit allocated to the interim period. The Company updates its estimated annual effective income tax rates on a quarterly basis considering the geographic mix of income or loss attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  
  
   -  7  - 

The Company s income tax benefit from continuing operations differs from the income tax benefit computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of   35%   to loss from continuing operations before income taxes as follows: 

Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance 
  Deferred tax assets are recorded for net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and 
  liabilities expected to produce tax deductions in future periods. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets would be deductible. The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) when determining whether a valuation allowance is required. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the deferred tax assets, including projected future taxable income, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and available tax planning strategies. 
  A significant item of objective negative evidence considered was the cumulative historical three year pre-tax loss and a net deferred tax asset position at   September 30, 2016  , driven primarily by the impairments of proved oil and gas properties recognized during the second half of 2015 and throughout   2016  , which limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as the Company s potential for future growth. Based on evaluation of the evidence available during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company s previous conclusion that it is more likely than not the net deferred tax assets will not be realized remained unchanged and an additional valuation allowance of   $36.7 million   was recorded for the three months ending   September 30, 2016  , reducing the net deferred tax assets to   zero  . This additional valuation allowance increased the total valuation allowance recorded during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $240.9 million  . 
  The Company will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods. The valuation allowance will remain until the Company can conclude that the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Future events or new evidence which may lead the Company to conclude that it is more likely than not its net deferred tax assets will be realized include, but are not limited to, cumulative historical pre-tax earnings, improvements in crude oil prices, and taxable events that could result from one or more transactions. The valuation allowance does not preclude the Company from utilizing the tax attributes if the Company recognizes taxable income. As long as the Company continues to conclude that the valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets is necessary, the Company will have no significant deferred income tax expense or benefit. 
   
  5.   Long-Term Debt  
  Long-term debt consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

-  8  - 

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility 
  The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that, as of   September 30, 2016  , had a borrowing base of   $600.0 million  , with   $96.0 million   of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of   2.46%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had   $0.4 million   in letters of credit outstanding, which reduce the amounts available under the revolving credit facility. The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility provides for interest-only payments until July 2, 2018, when the credit agreement matures and any outstanding borrowings are due. The borrowing base under the credit agreement is subject to regular redeterminations in the Spring and Fall of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement, in each case which may reduce the amount of the borrowing base. The amount the Company is able to borrow with respect to the borrowing base is subject to compliance with the financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement. Each of the capitalized terms which are not defined in this note shall have the meaning given to such terms in the credit agreement. 
  On May 3, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement (the  Eighth Amendment ) to, among other things (i) replace the Total Debt to EBITDA ratio covenant with a Total Secured Debt to EBITDA ratio covenant that requires such ratio not to exceed   2.00   to 1.00, (ii) add a covenant requiring a minimum EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio of at least   2.50   to 1.00, (iii) reduce the Borrowing Base under the credit facility from   $685.0 million   to   $600.0 million   until the next redetermination thereof, (iv) increase the required mortgage coverage on the total value of the oil and gas properties included in the Company s most recent reserve report from   80%   to   90%  , (v) require that the Company s deposit accounts and securities accounts (subject to certain exclusions) become subject to control agreements, (vi) limit the amount of additional senior notes that can be issued by the Company to   $400.0 million  , (vii) restrict the Company from making borrowings under the credit facility if the Company has or, after giving effect to the borrowing, will have a Consolidated Cash Balance in excess of   $50.0 million  , (viii) require mandatory prepayment of borrowings to the extent the Consolidated Cash Balance exceeds   $50.0 million   if either (a) the Company s ratio of Total Debt to EBITDA exceeds   3.50   to 1.00 or (b) the availability under the credit facility is equal to or less than   20%   of the then effective Borrowing Base, (ix) increase the margin on all loans by   0.50%  , and (x) increase the commitment fee from   0.375%   to   0.50%   when utilization of lender commitments is less than   50%  .  
  The obligations of the Company under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the Company s material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company s assets, including a mortgage lien on oil and gas properties having at least   90%   of the total value of the oil and gas properties included in the Company s most recent reserve report.   
  Borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at the Company s option at either (i) a base rate for a base rate loan plus the margin set forth in the table below, where the base rate is defined as the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   and the adjusted LIBO rate plus   1.00%  , or (ii) an adjusted LIBO rate for a Eurodollar loan plus the margin set forth in the table below. The Company also incurs commitment fees as set forth in the table below based on the unused portion of lender commitments, which are included in interest expense, net. 

As discussed above, the Company is subject to certain covenants under the terms of the credit agreement, which include the maintenance of the following financial covenants determined as of the last day of each quarter: (1) a ratio of Total Secured Debt to EBITDA of not more than   2.00   to 1.00; (2) a Current Ratio of not less than   1.00   to 1.00; and (3) a ratio of EBITDA to Interest Expense of not less than   2.50   to 1.00. As defined in the credit agreement, EBITDA includes the last four quarters after giving pro forma effect to EBITDA for material acquisitions and dispositions of oil and gas properties, Interest Expense is comprised of the aggregate interest expense paid in cash for the last four quarters, and the Current Ratio includes an add back of the unused portion of lender commitments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the ratio of Total Secured Debt to EBITDA was   0.24   to 1.00, the Current Ratio was   2.63   to 1.00 and the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Expense was   4.35   to 1.00. Because the financial covenants are determined as of the last day of each quarter, the ratios can fluctuate significantly period to period as the level of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are impacted by the timing of cash flows from operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and dispositions of oil and gas properties and securities offerings.  
  The credit agreement also places restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with respect to additional indebtedness, liens, dividends and other payments to shareholders, repurchases or redemptions of the Company s common stock, redemptions of senior notes, investments, acquisitions, mergers, asset dispositions, transactions with affiliates, hedging transactions and other matters.  
  
   -  9  - 

The credit agreement is subject to customary events of default, including in connection with a change in control. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders may elect to accelerate amounts due under the credit agreement (except in the case of a bankruptcy event of default, in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable). 
   
  6.   Commitments and Contingencies 
  From time to time, the Company is party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these events cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not currently expect these matters to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 
  The results of operations and financial position of the Company continue to be affected from time to time in varying degrees by domestic and foreign political developments as well as legislation and regulations pertaining to restrictions on crude oil and natural gas production, imports and exports, natural gas regulation, tax increases, environmental regulations and cancellation of contract rights. Both the likelihood and overall effect of such occurrences on the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. 
   
  7.   Stock-Based Compensation 
  Stock-Based Compensation Expense (Benefit), Net 
  The Company recognized the following stock-based compensation expense (benefit), net for the periods indicated which is reflected as  General and administrative, net  in the consolidated statements of operations: 

8.   Loss From Continuing Operations Per Common Share 
  Supplemental loss from continuing operations per common share information is provided below: 

For the   three and nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , the Company reported a loss from continuing operations. As a result, the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding excluded the anti-dilutive effect of   0.7 million   and   0.4 million   potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   0.7 million   potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  . 
   
  9.   Derivative Instruments 
  The Company uses commodity derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price volatility for a portion of its forecasted crude oil and natural gas production and thereby achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support the Company s drilling and completion capital expenditure program. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or  
  
   -  10  - 

trading purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s commodity derivative instruments consisted of fixed price swaps, costless collars, and purchased and sold call options, which are described below. 
  Fixed Price Swaps:   The Company receives a fixed price and pays a variable market price to the counterparties over specified periods for contracted volumes. 
  Costless Collars:   A collar is a combination of options including a purchased put option (fixed floor price) and a sold call option (fixed ceiling price) and allows the Company to benefit from increases in commodity prices up to the fixed ceiling price and protect the Company from decreases in commodity prices below the fixed floor price. At settlement, if the market price is below the fixed floor price or is above the fixed ceiling price, the Company receives the fixed price or pays the market price, respectively. If the market price is between the fixed floor price and fixed ceiling price, no payments are due from either party. These contracts were executed contemporaneously with the same counterparties and were premium neutral such that no payments were paid to or received from the counterparties. 
  Sold Call Options  : These contracts give the counterparties the right, but not the obligation, to buy contracted volumes from the Company over specified periods and prices in the future. At settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, the Company pays the counterparty the excess. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party.  
  Purchased Call Options  : These contracts give the Company the right, but not the obligation, to buy contracted volumes from the counterparties over specified periods and prices in the future. At settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, the counterparties pay the Company the excess. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party. The Company purchases call options contemporaneously with sales of call options to increase the fixed price of existing sold call options and therefore are presented on a net basis in the summary of open crude oil derivative positions below.  
  The following sets forth a summary of the Company s open crude oil derivative positions at average NYMEX prices as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The following sets forth a summary of the Company s open natural gas derivative positions at average NYMEX prices as of   September 30, 2016  : 

See  Note   13.   Subsequent Events  for details of derivative positions entered into subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  
  In February 2015, the Company entered into derivative transactions offsetting its then existing crude oil derivative positions covering the periods from March 2015 through December 2016. As a result of the offsetting derivative transactions, the Company locked in   $166.4 million   of cash flows, of which   $9.3 million   and   $40.0 million   were received due to contract settlements during the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $36.9 million   and   $79.9 million   during the   nine months  
  
   -  11  - 

ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are included in the  Cash received for derivative settlements, net  in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining locked in cash flows are   $10.6 million  , of which approximately   $7.9 million   will be received during the   fourth   quarter of 2016 and approximately   $2.7 million   will be received in the first quarter of   2017  , as the applicable contracts settle. All of the remaining locked in cash flows are current assets and are classified as  Derivative assets  in the consolidated balance sheets. The derivative assets associated with the offsetting derivative transactions are not subject to price risk. The offsetting derivative transactions are not included in the table above. 
  In February 2016, the Company sold out-of-the-money natural gas call options for the years 2017 through 2020 and used the associated premium value to obtain in-the-money crude oil fixed price swaps with a weighted average price of   $50.27   per Bbl on   6,000   Bbls/d for the first half of 2017. These out-of-the-money natural gas call options and in-the-money crude oil fixed price swaps were executed contemporaneously with the same counterparty, therefore, no cash premiums were paid to or received from the counterparty as the premium value associated with the natural gas call options was immediately applied to the crude oil fixed price swaps. 
  In March 2016, the Company sold   6,000   Bbls/d of in-the-money crude oil fixed price swaps for the first half of the year 2017 at a weighted average fixed price of   $50.00   per Bbl. The associated net premiums totaled approximately   $5.6 million  , of which approximately   $2.8 million   was paid during the second quarter of 2016 and the remaining   $2.8 million   was paid during the third quarter of 2016 and are included in the  Cash received for derivative settlements, net  in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  The Company typically has numerous hedge positions that span several time periods and often result in both fair value asset and liability positions held with that counterparty, which positions are all offset to a single fair value asset or liability at the end of each reporting period, including the deferred premiums associated with its hedge positions. The Company nets its derivative instrument fair values executed with the same counterparty pursuant to ISDA master agreements, which provide for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. The fair value of derivative instruments where the Company is in a net asset position with its counterparties as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $6.8 million   and   $119.6 million  , respectively, and is summarized by counterparty in the table below: 

The counterparties to the Company s derivative instruments are also lenders under the Company s credit agreement which allows the Company to satisfy any need for margin obligations associated with derivative instruments where the Company is in a net liability position with its counterparties with the collateral securing the credit agreement, thus eliminating the need for independent collateral posting. 
  Because each of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings, the Company believes it does not have significant credit risk and accordingly does not currently require its counterparties to post collateral to support the net asset positions of its derivative instruments. As such, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative instruments. Although the Company does not currently anticipate such nonperformance, it continues to monitor the credit ratings of its counterparties.  
   
  10.   Fair Value Measurements 
  Accounting guidelines for measuring fair value establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: 
  Level 1   Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2   Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which the Company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities. 
  
   -  12  - 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following tables summarize the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . All items included in the tables below are Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy: 

The fair values of the Company s derivative assets and liabilities are based on a third-party industry-standard pricing model that uses market data obtained from third-party sources, including quoted forward prices for crude oil and natural gas, discount rates and volatility factors. The fair values are also compared to the values provided by the counterparties for reasonableness and are adjusted for the counterparties  credit quality for derivative assets and the Company s credit quality for derivative liabilities.  
  The derivative asset and liability fair values reported in the consolidated balance sheets that pertain to the Company s derivative instruments are as of the balance sheet date and subsequently change to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. However, the fair value of the net derivative asset attributable to the offsetting crude oil derivative transactions are not subject to price risk as changes in the fair value of the original positions are offset by changes in the fair value of the offsetting positions. The Company typically has numerous hedge positions that span several time periods and often result in both derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty, which positions are all offset to a single derivative asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets, including the deferred premiums associated with its hedge positions. The Company nets the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities associated with derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty pursuant to ISDA master agreements, which provide for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. The Company had   no   transfers into Level 1 and no transfers into or out of Level 2 for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  . 
  
   -  13  - 

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
  The Company s other financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and long-term debt, which are classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and payables approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt associated with borrowings outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility approximates fair value as borrowings bear interest at variable rates. The following table presents the carrying amounts of the Company s senior notes and other long-term debt, net of debt premiums and debt issuance costs, with the fair values of each based on quoted market prices. 

11.   Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
  The rules of the SEC require that condensed consolidating financial information be provided for a subsidiary that has guaranteed the debt of a registrant issued in a public offering, where the guarantee is full, unconditional and joint and several and where the voting interest of the subsidiary is   100%   owned by the registrant. The Company is, therefore, presenting condensed consolidating financial information on a parent company, combined guarantor subsidiaries, combined non-guarantor subsidiaries and consolidated basis and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows, or financial position had such guarantor subsidiaries operated as independent entities.

  Sanchez Acquisition 
  On October 24, 2016, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Sanchez Energy Corporation and SN Cotulla Assets, LLC, a subsidiary of Sanchez Energy Corporation, to acquire oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford Shale primarily in LaSalle, Frio and McMullen Texas counties (the  Sanchez Acquisition ) for a purchase price of approximately   $181.0 million   in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction has an effective date of June 1, 2016, and is currently expected to close on or about December 14, 2016. On October 24, 2016, the Company paid   $10.0 million   as a deposit, which was funded from borrowings under the revolving credit facility that were repaid with net proceeds from the common stock offering discussed below. The remaining purchase price is due on the closing date. The Company intends to fund the remaining purchase price at closing with cash remaining from the common stock offering described below and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Upon consummation of the Sanchez Acquisition, the Company will become the operator of all the acquired properties.  
  Common Stock Offering 
  On October 28, 2016, the Company completed a public offering of   6.0 million   shares of its common stock at a price of   $37.32   per share, for proceeds of   $223.9 million  , net of underwriting discounts. The Company used the net proceeds from the common stock offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and intends to use any remaining proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Sanchez Acquisition due on the closing date.  
  Fall 2016 Borrowing Base Redetermination 
  On October 24, 2016, as a result of the Fall 2016 borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at   $600.0 million   until the next redetermination thereof. The borrowing base under the credit agreement is subject to regular redeterminations in the Spring and Fall of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement, in each case which may reduce the amount of the borrowing base.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following is management s discussion and analysis of the significant factors that affected the financial position and results of operations of Carrizo Oil   Gas, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. You should read this in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the discussion under  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( 2015 Annual Report ). 
   
  General Overview 
  Production, Commodity Prices and Revenue  . Total production for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   increased   13%   to   40,762   Boe/d from the total production for the   three months ended September 30,     2015   of   35,948   Boe/d, due primarily to increased production from new wells in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin as well as increased production in the Marcellus due to a lower level of voluntary curtailments compared to the third quarter of 2015. Production from the Eagle Ford comprised   71%   of our total production for the third quarter of 2016. Crude oil production for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   was   24,488   Bbls/d, an increase of   4%   from the   three months ended September 30,     2015  , primarily driven by increased production from new wells in the Eagle Ford, which averaged   21,649   Bbls/d. Revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   of   $111.2 million   increased as compared to revenues from   third   quarter of   2015   of   $106.2 million   driven primarily by the increased production described above and an increase in average realized NGL prices, partially offset by a decrease in average realized crude oil prices.  For further discussion of production, commodity prices and revenue, see   Results of Operations  below. 
  Operational Highlights  . See the table below for details of our operated drilling and completion activity by region:  

Recent Developments 
  Sanchez Acquisition.   On October 24, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Sanchez Energy Corporation and SN Cotulla Assets, LLC, a subsidiary of Sanchez Energy Corporation, to acquire oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford Shale primarily in LaSalle, Frio and McMullen Texas counties (the  Sanchez Acquisition ) for an agreed upon purchase price of approximately   $181.0 million   in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The properties to be acquired include approximately 15,000 net acres and 112 gross (93.0 net) wells. Based on information provided by the seller, we estimate that net production from the properties to be acquired was approximately 3,100 Boe/d for the month ended September 30, 2016. 
  The transaction had an effective date of June 1, 2016, and is currently expected to close on or about December 14, 2016. On October 24, 2016, we paid   $10.0 million   as a deposit, which was funded from borrowings under the revolving credit facility that were repaid with net proceeds from the common stock offering discussed below. The remaining purchase price is due on the closing date. We intend to fund the remaining purchase price at closing with cash remaining from the common stock offering described below and borrowings under its revolving credit facility.  Upon consummation of the Sanchez Acquisition, we will become the operator of all the acquired properties. 
  Financing Activities.   On October 28, 2016, we completed a public offering of 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $37.32 per share, which generated proceeds of $223.9 million, net of underwriting discounts. We used the net proceeds from the common stock offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and intend to use any remaining proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Sanchez Acquisition due on the closing date.  
  On October 24, 2016, as a result of the Fall 2016 borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at   $600.0 million   until the next redetermination thereof. The borrowing base under the credit agreement is subject to regular redeterminations in the Spring and Fall of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement, in each case which may change the amount of the borrowing base.

Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended September 30,     2016  , Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30,     2015    
  The following table summarizes total production volumes, daily production volumes, average realized prices and revenues for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  : 

Production volumes for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015   were   40,762   Boe/d and   35,948   Boe/d, respectively, an increase of   13%  . The increase is primarily due to increased production from new wells in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin as well as increased production in the Marcellus due to a lower level of voluntary curtailments compared to the third quarter of 2015. Revenues for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   increased   5%   to   $111.2 million   from   $106.2 million   for the same period in   2015   due primarily to the increased production described above as well as increased average realized NGL prices, partially offset by a decrease in average realized crude oil prices.  
  Lease operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   increased to   $24.3 million   (  $6.48   per Boe) from   $22.2 million   (  $6.72   per Boe) for the same period in   2015  . The increase in lease operating expenses is primarily due to increased production from new wells in the Eagle Ford. The decrease in lease operating expense per Boe is primarily due to lower produced water disposal costs.  
  Production taxes increased to   $4.9 million   (or   4.4%   of revenues) for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   from   $4.3 million   (or   4.0%   of revenues) for the same period in   2015   primarily as a result of the increase in natural gas and NGL revenues. The increase in production taxes as a percentage of revenues for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to the  
  
   -  21  - 

same period in   2015   is due primarily to an increased proportion of total revenues attributable to natural gas and NGL production in Eagle Ford, which is taxed at a higher rate than crude oil.  
  Ad valorem taxes decreased to   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   from   $2.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in ad valorem taxes is due to lower property tax valuations received during 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by an increase attributable to new wells drilled in Eagle Ford in 2015.  
  Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased   $32.4 million   to   $48.9 million   (  $13.05   per Boe) from the DD A expense for the   third   quarter of   2015   of   $81.3 million   (  $24.57   per Boe). The decrease in DD A expense is attributable to the decrease in the DD A rate per Boe, which is due primarily to the impairments of proved oil and gas properties recorded in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 as well as reductions in estimated future development costs primarily as a result of reduced service costs that have occurred since the third quarter of 2015. The components of our DD A expense were as follows: 

We recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   $105.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   due primarily to a   4%   decrease in the 12-Month Average Realized Price, as defined in  Note   3.   Property and Equipment, Net,  of crude oil from   $39.84   per barrel as of June 30, 2016 to   $38.36   per barrel as of September 30, 2016. We recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   $812.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2015   due primarily to a 19  %     decrease in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil from $68.92 per barrel as of June 30, 2015 to $56.05 per barrel as of September 30, 2015.    
  General and administrative expense, net increased to   $18.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   from   $4.2 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, net as a result of an increase in the fair value of stock appreciation rights for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   compared to a decrease in fair value for the   three months ended September 30,     2015  .  
  The gain on derivatives, net for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   amounted to   $11.7 million   due primarily to the downward shift in the futures curve of forecasted commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas from July 1, 2016 to   September 30, 2016  . The gain on derivatives, net for the   three months ended September 30,     2015   amounted to   $28.8 million   due primarily to new crude oil hedge positions executed during the third quarter of   2015   and the downward shift in the futures curve of forecasted commodity prices for crude oil from July 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest expense, net for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   was   $21.2 million   as compared to   $16.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was due primarily to the decrease in capitalized interest as a result of lower average balances of unevaluated leasehold and seismic costs and exploratory well costs in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the third quarter of   2015  . The components of our interest expense, net were as follows: 

The effective income tax rates for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   were   0.3%   and   12.7%  , respectively. This reduction in the effective income tax rate is primarily a result of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets driven by the impairments of proved oil and gas properties described above.

Results of Operations 
  Nine Months Ended September 30,     2016  , Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015    
  The following table summarizes total production volumes, daily production volumes, average realized prices and revenues for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  : 

Production volumes for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015   were   41,438   Boe/d and   35,559   Boe/d, respectively. The increase in production from the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   to the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was primarily due to increased production from new wells in the Eagle Ford. Revenues for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   decreased   9%   to   $299.8 million   from   $329.8 million   for the same period in   2015   primarily due to the decrease in average realized crude oil prices, partially offset by the increase in crude oil production.  
  Lease operating expenses for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   increased to   $71.1 million   (  $6.26   per Boe) from   $67.3 million   (  $6.93   per Boe) for the same period in   2015  . The increase in lease operating expenses is primarily due to increased production from new wells in the Eagle Ford, partially offset by reduced costs due primarily to a decrease in produced water disposal costs as a result of an increase in the proportion of produced water volumes being transported to disposal sites via pipeline instead of truck. The decrease in lease operating expense per Boe is primarily due to the lower produced water disposal costs described above.  
  Production taxes decreased to   $12.9 million   (or   4.3%   of revenues) for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   from   $13.3 million   (or   4.0%   of revenues) for the same period in   2015   primarily as a result of the decrease in crude oil revenues related to the decrease in average realized crude oil prices, partially offset by increased crude oil production. The increase in production taxes  
  
   -  23  - 

as a percentage of revenues for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   is primarily due to an increased proportion of total revenues attributable to natural gas and NGL production in Eagle Ford, which is taxed at a higher rate than crude oil. 
  Ad valorem taxes decreased to   $4.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   from   $7.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in ad valorem taxes is due to lower property tax valuations received during 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by an increase attributable to new wells drilled in Eagle Ford in 2015. 
  DD A expense for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   decreased   $74.0 million   to   $160.5 million   (  $14.14   per Boe) from   $234.5 million   (  $24.15   per Boe) for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in DD A expense is attributable to the decrease in the DD A rate per Boe, which is due primarily to impairments of our proved oil and gas properties recorded in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 as well as reductions in estimated future development costs primarily as a result of reduced service costs that have occurred since the third quarter of 2015. The components of our DD A expense were as follows: 

We recorded impairments of proved oil and gas properties of   $576.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   due primarily to a 19% decrease in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil from $47.24 per barrel as of December 31, 2015 to   $38.36   per barrel as of   September 30, 2016  . We recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   $812.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   due primarily to a 39% d  ecrease in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil from $92.24 per barrel as of December 31, 2014 to $56.05 per barrel as of September 30, 2015  . 
  General and administrative expense, net increased to   $59.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   from   $54.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, net as a result of an increase in the fair value of stock appreciation rights for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to a decrease in fair value for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , partially offset by lower annual bonuses awarded in the first quarter of   2016   compared to the first quarter of   2015  .  
  The loss on derivatives, net for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   amounted to   $29.9 million   primarily due to crude oil and natural gas hedge positions executed during   2016   as well as the upward shift in the futures curve of forecasted commodity prices for crude oil from January 1, 2016 (or the subsequent date on which new contracts were entered into) to September 30, 2016. The gain on derivatives, net for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   amounted to   $42.6 million   primarily due to new crude oil hedge positions executed during 2015, the downward shift in the futures curve of forecasted commodity prices for crude oil during the first quarter of 2015 prior to our lock-in of our then existing crude oil derivative positions as well as during the third quarter of 2015, and the downward shift in the futures curve of forecasted commodity prices for natural gas from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015. 
  Interest expense, net for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was   $58.9 million   as compared to   $51.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was due primarily to the decrease in capitalized interest as a result of lower average balances of unevaluated leasehold and seismic costs and exploratory well costs for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , partially offset by lower interest associated with the $650.0 million of 6.25% Senior Notes that were issued in April 2015 as compared to the interest associated with the $600.0 million of 8.625% Senior Notes that were redeemed in April 2015. The components of our interest expense, net were as follows: 

-  24  - 

The effective income tax rates for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015   were   0.0%   and   15.3%  , respectively. This reduction in the effective income tax rate is primarily a result of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets driven by the impairments of proved oil and gas properties described above. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  2016   Capital Expenditure Plan and Funding Strategy.   In November, our 2016 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan was increased to   $400.0 million to $410.0 million   from the previous range of   $370.0 million to $380.0 million   as a result of planned additional spending in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our 2016 leasehold and seismic capital expenditure plan has been increased from $20.0 million to $25.0 million. The 2016 drilling and completion capital expenditure plan and the 2016 leasehold and seismic capital expenditure plan exclude any impact of the Sanchez Acquisition. We currently intend to finance our   2016   capital expenditure plan primarily from the sources described below under   Sources and Uses of Cash.  Our capital program could vary depending upon various factors, including the availability and cost of drilling rigs, land and industry partner issues, our available cash flow and financing, success of drilling programs, weather delays, commodity prices, market conditions, the acquisition of leases with drilling commitments and other factors. Below is a summary of capital expenditures through   September 30, 2016  :  

(1) 
    Our capital expenditure plan and the capital expenditures included above exclude capitalized general and administrative expense, capitalized interest and capitalized asset retirement obligations. 
     Sources and Uses of Cash  . Our primary use of cash is related to our drilling and completion capital expenditure plan and, to a lesser extent, our leasehold and seismic capital expenditure plan. For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , we funded our capital expenditures with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Potential sources of future liquidity include the following: 
             
    Cash provided by operations.   Cash flows from operations are highly dependent on crude oil prices. As such, we hedge a portion of our forecasted production to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility in order to achieve a more predictable level of cash flows. 
                
    Borrowings under our revolving credit facility.   As of   October 28, 2016  , our revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of   $600.0 million  , with   no   borrowings outstanding and   $0.4 million   in letters of credit issued, which reduce the amounts available under our revolving credit facility. The amount we are able to borrow is subject to compliance with the financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility.  
                
    Securities offerings  . As situations or conditions arise, we may choose to issue debt, equity or other securities to supplement our cash flows. However, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In October 2016, we sold 6.0 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of $37.32 per share. We used the proceeds of $223.9 million, net of underwriting discounts, to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and intend to use any remaining proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Sanchez Acquisition due on the closing date. 
                
    Asset sales.   In order to fund our capital expenditure plan, we may consider the sale of certain properties or assets that are not part of our core business or are no longer deemed essential to our future growth, provided we are able to sell such assets on terms that are acceptable to us. We continue to explore sales of non-core properties. We may also consider the sale of properties in areas we have viewed as core, such as the Delaware Basin, particularly if we believe that sales prices for such assets would allow us to deploy capital more effectively in other basins or other parts of the same basin. There can be no assurance, however, that any sales will occur on terms we find to be acceptable, or at all. 
                
    Joint ventures.   Joint ventures with third parties through which such third parties fund a portion of our exploration activities to earn an interest in our exploration acreage or purchase a portion of interests, or both.

Overview of Cash Flow Activities.     Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was   $197.8 million   and   $284.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The change was due primarily to a decrease in crude oil revenues, resulting primarily from lower average realized crude oil prices in   2016   as compared to   2015  , a decrease in the net cash received from derivative settlements, and an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by a decrease in cash general and administrative expense. 
  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was   $331.6 million   and   $539.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in our capital expenditures in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was   $94.0 million   and   $249.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in March 2015 and the issuance of the 6.25% Senior Notes in April 2015, as well as increased borrowings net of repayments under our revolving credit facility for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   as compared to the same period in 2016, partially offset by the tender and redemption of the 8.625% Senior Notes during the second quarter of 2015 and the payment of the deferred purchase payment in February 2015. 
  Liquidity/Cash Flow Outlook.   Economic downturns may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets in the future. Cash flows from operations are primarily driven by crude oil production, commodity prices and settlements of our commodity derivatives. As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices, our revenues and thus our cash flows from operations have also declined. However, this decline in our cash flows from operations was partially offset due to the net cash we received from derivative settlements. We currently believe that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility provide adequate financial flexibility and will be sufficient to fund our immediate cash flow requirements.  
             
    Revolving credit facility.   As of   October 28, 2016  , our revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of   $600.0 million  , with   no   borrowings outstanding and   $0.4 million   in letters of credit issued, which reduce the amounts available under our revolving credit facility. The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is affected by assumptions with respect to, among other things, future crude oil and natural gas prices, which are determined by the administrative agent of our revolving credit facility. Our borrowing base may decrease if our administrative agent reduces its expectations with respect to future crude oil and natural gas prices from those used to determine our existing borrowing base.  
     On October 24, 2016, as a result of our Fall 2016 borrowing base redetermination, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $600.0 million. The amount we are able to borrow is subject to compliance with the financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. 
             
    Hedging.   To manage our exposure to commodity price risk and to provide a level of certainty in the cash flows to support our drilling and completion capital expenditure plan, we hedge a portion of our forecasted production.  
     In February 2015, we entered into derivative transactions offsetting our then existing crude oil derivative positions, which locked in $166.4 million of cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining locked in cash flows from the offsetting derivative transactions was approximately   $10.6 million  , of which approximately   $7.9 million   will be received during the   fourth   quarter of 2016 and approximately   $2.7 million   will be received in the first quarter of 2017, as the applicable contracts settle. 
  
   -  26  - 

As of   October 28, 2016  , we had the following crude oil and natural gas derivative positions:  

Based on existing market conditions and our expected liquidity needs, among other factors, we may use a portion of our cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, securities offerings or borrowings to reduce debt prior to scheduled maturities through debt repurchases, either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, through debt redemptions or tender offers, or through repayments of bank borrowings.

Contractual Obligations 
  The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(3) 
    Cash payments for interest on our revolving credit facility were calculated using the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   of   2.46%  . Commitment fees on our revolving credit facility were calculated based on the unused portion of lender commitments as of   September 30, 2016  , at the commitment fee rate of   0.500%  . 
              (4) 
    Drilling rig contracts represent gross contractual obligations and accordingly, other joint owners in the properties operated by us will generally be billed for their working interest share of such costs.  
              (5) 
    Asset retirement obligations and other are based on estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts as of   September 30, 2016  . Certain of such estimates and assumptions are inherently unpredictable and will differ from actual results. 
      
  Financing Arrangements 
  Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have a senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that, as of   September 30, 2016  , had a borrowing base of   $600.0 million  , with   $96.0 million   of borrowings outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   2.46%   and   $0.4 million   in letters of credit outstanding. The credit agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility provides for interest-only payments until July 2, 2018, when the credit agreement matures and any outstanding borrowings are due. The borrowing base under our credit agreement is subject to regular redeterminations in the Spring and Fall of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement, in each case which may reduce the amount of the borrowing base. As a result of the Fall redetermination, effective October 24, 2016, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at   $600.0 million  .  
  See  Note   5.   Long-Term Debt  for additional details of the senior secured revolving credit facility including rates of interest on outstanding borrowings, commitment fees on the unused portion of lender commitments, and the financial covenants we are subject to under the terms of the credit agreement.  
  7.50% Senior Notes due 2020 
  Since September 15, 2016, we had the right to redeem all or a portion of the 7.50% Senior Notes at redemption prices decreasing from 103.75% to 100% of the principal amount on September 15, 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with any redemption or repurchase of notes, we could enter into other transactions, which include refinancing of the 7.50% Senior Notes.  
  Common Stock Offering 
  In October 2016, we sold   6.0 million   shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of   $37.32   per share. We used the proceeds of $223.9 million, net of underwriting discounts, to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and intend to use any remaining proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Sanchez Acquisition due on the closing date. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  
  
   -  28  - 

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Certain of such estimates and assumptions are inherently unpredictable and will differ from actual results. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: use of estimates, oil and gas properties, oil and gas reserve estimates, derivative instruments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. These policies and estimates are described in  Note   2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Annual Report. We evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued. 
  Impairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties 
  At the end of each quarter, the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, are limited to the  cost center ceiling  equal to (i) the sum of (A) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of   10%  , (B) the costs of unproved properties not being amortized, and (C) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized; less (ii) related income tax effects. Any excess of the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, over the cost center ceiling is recognized as an impairment of proved oil and gas properties. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher commodity prices in the future result in a cost center ceiling in excess of the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes. 
  The estimated future net revenues used in the cost center ceiling are calculated using the average realized prices for sales of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas on the first calendar day of each month during the 12-month period prior to the end of the current quarter ( 12-Month Average Realized Price ), held flat for the life of the production, except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Prices do not include the impact of derivative instruments as we elected not to meet the criteria to qualify derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment. 
  Primarily due to declines in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil, we recognized impairments of proved oil and gas properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as summarized in the table below:  

The decrease in the 12-Month Average Realized price of crude oil was primarily responsible for a negative revision to our proved reserves for the   third   quarter of   2016   totaling 0.8 MMBoe (less than 1% of   December 31, 2015   proved reserves), all of which was attributable to proved developed reserves of producing wells and proved undeveloped reserves with shorter economic lives. There were no proved undeveloped reserve locations that became uneconomic as a result of the decrease in the 12-Month Average Realized Price as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  
   -  29  - 

The table below presents various pricing scenarios to demonstrate the sensitivity of our   September 30, 2016   cost center ceiling to changes in the 12-month average benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices underlying the 12-Month Average Realized Prices. The sensitivity analysis is as of   September 30, 2016   and, accordingly, does not consider the results of drilling and completion activity, production, changes in oil and gas prices, and changes in development and operating costs occurring subsequent to   September 30, 2016   which may require revisions to estimates of proved reserves. 

Our estimated range of the fourth quarter cost center ceiling, at the high end, would exceed the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, and at the low end, would result in an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   $50.0 million  . This estimated range of the fourth quarter cost center ceiling is based on the estimated 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil of   $39.26   per barrel as of   December 31, 2016  , which is based on the average realized price for sales of crude oil on the first calendar day of each month for the first 11 months and an estimate for the twelfth month based on a quoted forward price. We estimate that we will not have any negative revisions of proved reserves for the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil used in our forecast. Declines in the 12-Month Average Realized Price of crude oil in subsequent quarters would result in a lower present value of the estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves and may result in additional impairments of proved oil and gas properties. 
  The key factors and assumptions we used to estimate proved reserves and a potential impairment for the   fourth   quarter of   2016   include planned drilling and completion activity, forecasted production, oil and gas price differentials and development and production costs. Given the uncertainty associated with these key factors and assumptions, these estimates should not necessarily be construed as indicative of our future results. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes are recognized based on earnings reported for tax return purposes in addition to a provision for deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized at the end of each reporting period for the future tax consequences of cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements based on existing tax laws and enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income. We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider all available evidence (both positive and negative) when determining whether a valuation allowance is required. In making this assessment, we evaluated possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets, including projected future taxable income, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and available tax planning strategies. 
  A significant item of objective negative evidence considered was the cumulative historical three year pre-tax loss and a net deferred tax asset position at   September 30, 2016  , driven primarily by the impairments of proved oil and gas properties recognized during the second half of 2015 and throughout   2016  , which limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our potential for future growth. We also have estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of   $611.1 million   as of  
  
   -  30  - 

September 30, 2016  . Based on evaluation of the evidence available during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our previous conclusion that it is more likely than not the net deferred tax assets will not be realized remained unchanged and an additional valuation allowance of   $36.7 million   was recorded for the three months ending   September 30, 2016  , reducing the net deferred tax assets to   zero  . This additional valuation allowance increased the total valuation allowance recorded during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to $240.9 million. 
  We will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods. The valuation allowance will remain until we can conclude that the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Future events or new evidence which may lead us to conclude that it is more likely than not our net deferred tax assets will be realized include, but are not limited to, cumulative historical pre-tax earnings, improvements in crude oil prices, and taxable events that could result from one or more transactions. The valuation allowance does not preclude us from utilizing the tax attributes if we recognize taxable income. As long as we continue to conclude that the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is necessary, we will have no significant deferred income tax expense or benefit.  
  We classify interest and penalties associated with income taxes as interest expense. We follow the tax law ordering approach to determine the sequence in which deferred tax assets and other tax attributes are utilized. 
  Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  See  Note   2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  for discussion of the accounting pronouncements we recently adopted and the accounting pronouncements recently issued by the FASB. 
   
  Volatility of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices 
  Our revenues, future rate of growth, results of operations, financial position and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas, which are affected by changes in market supply and demand, overall economic activity, global political environment, weather, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors, as well as the level and prices at which we have hedged our future production.  
  We review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties on a quarterly basis under the full cost method of accounting. See   Critical Accounting Policies Impairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties  and  Note   3.   Property and Equipment, Net  for additional details. 
  We use commodity derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility for a substantial, but varying, portion of our forecasted crude oil and natural gas production and thereby achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support our drilling and completion capital expenditure plan. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , our commodity derivative instruments consisted of fixed price swaps, costless collars, and purchased and sold call options. See  Note   9.   Derivative Instruments  for further details of our crude oil and natural gas derivative positions as of   September 30, 2016   and  Note   13.   Subsequent Events Hedging Update  for further details of the crude oil and natural gas derivative positions entered into subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  of our   2015   Annual Report. Except as disclosed in this report, there have been no material changes from the disclosure made in our   2015   Annual Report regarding our exposure to certain market risks. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  . Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. They concluded that the controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. While our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the appropriate information will be available on a timely basis, this assurance is subject to limitations inherent in any control system, no matter how well it may be designed or administered. 
  Changes in Internal Controls  . There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Part II. Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time, the Company is party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these events cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not currently expect these matters to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Except as disclosed below, there were no material changes to the factors discussed in  Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  We may not consummate the Sanchez Acquisition. 
  There can be no assurances that the Sanchez Acquisition will be consummated on the terms described herein or at all, or that the consummation of the Sanchez Acquisition will not be delayed beyond the expected closing date. If we do not complete the Sanchez Acquisition, we will not have the opportunity to attempt to realize the benefits we believe the acquisition will afford us. 
  We have performed only a limited investigation of the properties to be acquired in the Sanchez Acquisition. The completion of the Sanchez Acquisition is subject to specified closing conditions and to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the transaction including in the event that more than specified adjustments to the purchase price are required. If one or more of the closing conditions are not satisfied, or if the transaction is otherwise terminated, the Sanchez Acquisition may not be completed. Some of these conditions are beyond our control. Some of these conditions are in part within our control; other conditions are all or in part within the control of Sanchez; and we may elect not to take actions necessary to satisfy these conditions or to ensure that the transaction is not otherwise terminated. 
  If the Sanchez Acquisition is not consummated, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of our recent equity offering and could apply the proceeds in ways that shareholders may not approve, which could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition such application may not be as beneficial to us as the Sanchez Acquisition may have been. If the Sanchez Acquisition is delayed, not consummated or consummated in a manner different than described herein, the price of our common stock may decline.  
  We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Sanchez Acquisition and may have difficulty integrating with the Sanchez Acquisition. 
  Even if we consummate the Sanchez Acquisition, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Sanchez Acquisition.  There can be no assurance that the Sanchez Acquisition will be beneficial to us.  We may not be able to integrate the properties to be acquired without increases in costs, losses in revenues or other difficulties. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with the integration could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the price of our common stock. 
  
   -  33  - 

Our assessment of properties to be acquired to date has been limited and, even by the time of closing, it will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our assessment, we will not receive an independent reserve engineer report related to the properties to be acquired. We may incur costs or experience problems related to the properties to be acquired in the Sanchez Acquisition and we may not have adequate recourse against Sanchez. Although we will inspect the properties being sold to us, inspections may not reveal all structural or environmental problems. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. Our ability to make specified claims against Sanchez in the Sanchez Acquisition generally expires over time and we may be left with no recourse for liabilities and other problems associated with the Sanchez Acquisition that we do not discover prior to the expiration date related to such matters under the purchase and sale agreement. 
  The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Sanchez Acquisition if, among other things, the integration of the properties to be acquired is unsuccessful or if the liabilities, expenses, title, environmental and other defects, or transaction costs related to the Sanchez Acquisition are greater than expected or the properties to be acquired do not yield the anticipated returns. The market price of our common stock may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Sanchez Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by us or by securities market participants or if the effect of the Sanchez Acquisition on our business results of operations or financial condition or prospects is not consistent with our expectations or those of securities market participants.
