Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Nanophase Technologies Corporation   ( Nanophase 
or the  Company , including  we ,  our  or  us )  reflect
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial position and operating results of the Company for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016.   

These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended
December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

Description of Business   

Nanophase
is an advanced materials and applications developer and commercial manufacturer with an integrated family of nanomaterial and
related technologies. We produce engineered nano and larger, sub-micron, materials for use in a variety of diverse markets: personal
care including sunscreens, architectural coatings, industrial coating applications, abrasion-resistant additives, plastics additives,
medical diagnostics, energy, and a variety of surface finishing technologies (polishing) applications. We target markets in which
we believe practical solutions may be found using our products. We work closely with current and potential customers in these
target markets to identify their material and performance requirements and market our materials to various end-use applications
manufacturers. Recently developed technologies have made certain new products possible and opened potential new markets. We recently
developed new material solutions in the personal care (primarily under the newly created brand  Sol sence ),
surface finishing technologies (polishing) and energy-management areas that have been taken to potential customers, and for which
we are experiencing early stage revenue. Although our primary strategic focus has been the North American market, we currently
sell material to customers overseas and have been working to expand our reach within foreign markets.  

The
Company was incorporated in Illinois on November 25, 1989, and became a Delaware corporation in November 1997. Our common stock
trades on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol NANX.  

While
product sales comprise the majority of our revenue, we also recognize revenue from other sources from time to time. These activities
are not expected to drive the long-term growth of the business. For this reason we classify such revenue as  other revenue 
in our Statement of Operations, as it does not represent revenue directly from our nanocrystalline materials.  

(3)
Earnings Per Share  

Options
to purchase approximately 2,115,000 shares of common stock, that were outstanding as of September 30, 2016, were not included
in the computation of earnings per share for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, as the impact of such
shares would be both negligible and anti-dilutive. Options to purchase approximately 507,000 shares of common stock, that were
outstanding as of September 30, 2015, were not included in the computation of earnings per share for the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2015, as the impact of such shares would be both negligible and anti-dilutive.  

(4)
Financial Instruments  

We
follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic
820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities
into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable
measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.  

Our
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, along with
the promissory note with no related borrowings and any borrowings on the working capital line of credit, each described in Note
4. The fair values of all financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values. There were no financial
assets or liabilities adjusted to fair value on September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

(5)
Note and Line of Credit  

During
July 2014, we entered into a bank-issued letter of credit and related promissory note for up to $30 in borrowings to support our
obligations under our facility lease agreement. No borrowings have been incurred under this promissory note. Should any borrowings
occur in the future, the interest rate would be the prime rate plus 1%, with the bank having the right to  set off 
or apply unpaid balances against our checking account if we fail to meet our obligations under any borrowings under the note.
We have renewed this note annually and it is our intention to continue to do so for as long as we need to pursuant to the terms
of our facility lease agreement. Because there were no amounts outstanding at any time during 2016 or 2015, we have recorded no
related liability on our balance sheet.     

During
March 2015, we entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the  Line of Credit Agreement ) with Libertyville Bank and
Trust Company, a Wintrust Community Bank ( Libertyville ), our primary bank, which was subsequently amended on April
13, 2015. Under the Line of Credit Agreement, as amended, Libertyville will provide a maximum of $300, or 75% of our eligible
accounts receivable, whichever is less, of revolving credit, collateralized by a senior priority lien on our accounts receivable,
inventory, equipment, general intangibles and fixtures. Interest on any borrowings would be the prime rate at the time plus 1%.
We must have at least $1 million in cash, including any amounts borrowed, at Libertyville on the date of any advance. Advances
may only occur at the beginning or end of a fiscal quarter and must be repaid in full within five days of the advance. The Line
of Credit Agreement was extended during March 2016, and now expires on March 4, 2017. There were two advances under this Line
of Credit Agreement during 2015 that were subsequently repaid within five days of each advance, and no advances during the first
nine months of 2016.   

(6)
Inventories   

Inventories
consist of the following:  

(7)
Share-Based Compensation   

We
follow FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , in which compensation expense is recognized only for
share-based payments expected to vest. We recognized compensation expense related to stock options of $41 and $129 for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $46 and $141 for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2015, respectively.   

As
of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $216 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation
arrangements granted under our stock option plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period
of 1.8 years.  

Stock
Options and Stock Grants   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 44,500 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to stock option exercises for proceeds
of $18. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 69,333 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to stock option exercises
for proceeds of $26. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 419,390 stock options were granted compared to 461,100 stock
options granted during the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 64,900 stock options were forfeited
compared to 248,900 stock options forfeited during the same period in 2015. We had 2,884,000 stock options outstanding at a weighted
average exercise price of $0.87 on September 30, 2016, compared to 2,574,000 stock options outstanding at a weighted average exercise
price of $0.95 on December 31, 2015.  

The
following table illustrates the various assumptions used to calculate the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options
granted during the periods presented:

        95  %  
 
     Weighted-average fair value of the options granted:    
                
     $  0.34     

Stock
Appreciation Rights   

Prior
to 2011, we granted our outside directors stock appreciation rights (SARs). The change in fair value of the awards granted during
prior years is included in non-cash compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The
SARs granted vested immediately and are payable upon the directors  removal or resignation from the position of director.
These awards are accounted for as liability awards, included in accrued expenses as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and adjusted
to fair value each reporting period. The fair value of the liability was less than $1 on both September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any unvested restricted stock or performance shares outstanding.  

(8)
Significant Customers and Contingencies    

Sales
to three customers constituted approximately 65%, 5% and 6%, respectively, of our total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016, and 69%, 6% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Amounts included
in accounts receivable on September 30, 2016 relating to these three customers were approximately $784, $122 and $150, respectively.
Revenue from these three customers constituted approximately 69%, 3% and 0%, respectively, of our total revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 and 62%, 5% and 6%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Amounts included
in accounts receivable on September 30, 2015 relating to these three customers were approximately $871, $85 and $0, respectively.
The loss of one of these significant customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

We
currently have exclusive supply agreements with BASF Corporation ( BASF ), our largest customer, that have contingencies
outlined which could potentially result in the license of technology and/or the sale of production equipment from the Company
to the customer intended to provide capacity sufficient to meet the customer s production needs. This outcome may occur
if we fail to meet certain performance requirements, certain other obligations and/or certain financial covenants. The most restrictive
financial covenants in one of our supply agreements with BASF  trigger  a technology transfer right (license and equipment
sale at BASF s option) in the event (a) that earnings for the twelve month period ending with our most recently published
quarterly financial statements are less than zero and our cash, cash equivalents and certain investments are less than $1 million,
or (b) of an acceleration of any debt maturity having a principal amount of more than $10 million. Our supply agreements with
BASF also  trigger  a technology transfer right in the event of our insolvency, as further defined within the agreements.
In the event of an equipment sale, upon incurring a triggering event, the equipment would be sold to the customer at either 115%
of the equipment s net book value or the greater of 30% of the original book value of such equipment, and any associated
upgrades to it, or 115% of the equipment s net book value, depending on the contract and related equipment.  

We
believe that we have sufficient cash and credit availability (See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management s Discussion
and Analysis in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion )  to operate our business during 2016 and into
2017. If a triggering event were to occur and BASF elected to proceed with the license and related equipment sale mentioned above,
we would receive royalty payments from this customer for products sold using our technology; however, we would lose both significant
revenue and the ability to generate significant revenue to replace that which was lost in the near term. Replacement of necessary
equipment that could be purchased and removed by the customer pursuant to this triggering event could take in excess of twelve
months. Any additional capital outlays required to rebuild capacity would probably be greater than the proceeds from the purchase
of the assets as dictated by our agreement with the customer. Similar consequences would occur if we were determined to have materially
breached certain other provisions of the supply agreement with BASF. Any such event would also likely result in the loss of many
of our key staff and line employees due to economic realities. We believe that our employees are a critical component of our success
and it could be difficult to replace them quickly. Given the occurrence of any such event, we might not be able to hire and retain
skilled employees given the stigma relating to such an event and its impact on us. Finally, any shortfall in capital needed to
operate the business as management intends, including with respect to avoiding this triggering event as described above, may result
in a curtailment of certain activities or anticipated investments.  

Should events arise that
make it appropriate for us to seek additional financing, such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or
even at all, and any such financing could be dilutive to our stockholders. Such a financing could be necessitated by such things
as the loss of one or more significant customers or a significant decline in revenue from those customers, currently unknown capital
requirements, new regulatory requirements, the need to meet cash requirements under our BASF agreement to avoid a triggering event,
or other circumstances not currently anticipated by us. The failure to obtain sufficient capital may impair or curtail our business
plans and under such circumstances may raise doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

(9) Business Segmentation and Geographical
Distribution  

Revenue from international
sources approximated $143 and $618 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $398 and $962
for the same periods in 2015. All of this revenue was product revenue. 

Our operations comprise
a single business segment and all of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. 

(10) New Accounting Pronouncements  

During May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and
several related updates including ASU No. 2016-08 and ASU No. 2016-10, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it
transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those
goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires certain disclosures designed to help users of financial statements better
understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period,
which is our first quarter of 2018. The new standard allows application either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented
or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09
will have on our financial statements and related disclosures, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

During February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ),  Leases (Topic 842) . This standard requires the recognition of assets and liabilities
arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly,
a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease
obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over
the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification
of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease
will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by
class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional
qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These
disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about
the nature of an organization s leasing activities. The amendments in this standard are effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact its adoption will have on the presentation of our financial statements and related disclosures. 

During August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ).
ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide
related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period
ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption will have an impact on the presentation
of our financial statements, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures. 

During March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which amends ASC Topic 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation .
The objective of this update is part of the FASB s Simplification Initiative as it applies to several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. The effective date of the update is for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
of this accounting standard but do not believe that the adoption will have a material impact on the presentation of our financial
statements, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

Nanophase is an advanced
materials and applications developer and commercial manufacturer with an integrated family of materials technologies. We produce
engineered nano and sub-micron materials for use in a variety of diverse markets: personal care including sunscreens, architectural
coatings, industrial coating applications, abrasion-resistant additives, plastics additives, medical diagnostics, energy, and a
variety of surface finishing technologies (polishing) applications, including optics. We target markets in which we believe practical
solutions may be found using our products. We work closely with current and potential customers in these target markets to identify
their material and performance requirements and market our materials to various end-use applications manufacturers. Recently developed
technologies have made certain new products possible and opened potential new markets. For example, we have applied our skills
at producing precisely defined nanomaterials to now create and sell larger, sub-micron material products. Our focus is on customer
need where we believe we have an advantage, as opposed to finding uses for one particular technology. We expect growth in end-user
(manufacturing customers, including customers of our customers) adoption in 2016 and beyond. Our initiatives in targeted market
areas are progressing at differing rates of speed, but we have been broadly moving through testing and development cycles, and
in a number of cases believe we are approaching first revenue or next stage revenue with particular customers in the industries
referenced above. We have recently developed material solutions in the personal care (particularly under the newly created brand
 Sol sence ) and energy-management (particularly solar control) areas that have been taken to potential customers
and for which early stage revenues are occurring. We believe that successful introduction of our materials with manufacturers may
lead to follow-on orders for other materials in their applications. We expect that we will both work more deeply with current customers
and attract additional customers, which should help us achieve growth in these markets in 2017 and beyond. 

Results of Operations 

Total revenue decreased
to $2,521,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,786,000 for the same period in 2015. Total revenue
increased to $8,415,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,033,000 for the same period in 2015. Product
revenue, the primary component of our total revenue, decreased to $2,510,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $2,779,000 for the same period in 2015. We believe that shipment timing impacted the third quarter 2016, while the overall increase
in business volume, particularly with our largest customer in personal care, drove the nine-month revenue increase. Product revenue
increased to $8,377,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,000,000 for the same period in 2015. 

Revenue from our three
largest customers constituted approximately 65%, 5% and 6%, respectively, of our total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016, and 69%, 6% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Revenue from these
three customers constituted approximately 69%, 3% and 0%, respectively, of our total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2015 and 62%, 5% and 6%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other revenue was $11,000
and $38,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7,000 and $33,000 for the same periods in 2015.
This was comprised primarily of shipping costs paid by customers, as well as non-recurring fee-based development projects that
were paid by customers. 

Cost of revenue generally
includes costs associated with commercial production. Cost of revenue decreased to $1,841,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $1,903,000 for the same period in 2015, primarily due to decreased revenue volume partially offset by inefficiencies
associated with lower volumes. Cost of revenue increased to $5,766,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$5,593,000 for the same period in 2015, primarily driven by revenue volumes. We expect to continue new nanomaterial development,
primarily using our NanoArc  synthesis and dispersion technologies, for targeted applications and new markets during 2016 and
beyond. At current revenue levels we have generated a positive gross margin, though margins have been impeded by not having enough
revenue to efficiently absorb manufacturing overhead that is required to work with current customers and expected future customers.
We believe that our current fixed manufacturing cost structure is sufficient to support significantly higher levels of production.
The extent to which margins grow, as a percentage of total revenue, will be dependent upon revenue mix, revenue volume, our ability
to continue to cut costs and pass commodity market-driven raw materials increases on to customers. We expect that product revenue
volume increases would result in our fixed manufacturing costs being more efficiently absorbed, leading to increased margins. We
expect to continue to focus on reducing controllable variable product manufacturing costs, with potential variability related to
the commodity metals markets, but may or may not realize absolute dollar gross margin growth through 2016 and beyond, dependent
upon the factors discussed above. 

Research and development
expense, which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups, primarily consists of costs associated
with the development or acquisition of new product applications and coating formulations and the cost of enhancing our manufacturing
processes. As an example, we have been, and continue to be, engaged in research to enhance our ability to disperse material in
a variety of organic and inorganic media for use as coatings and polishing materials. Much of this work has led to several new
products and additional potential new products. 

Having demonstrated the
capability to produce pilot quantities of mixed-metal oxides in a single crystal phase, we do not expect development of further
variations on these materials to present material technological challenges. Many of these materials exhibit performance characteristics
that can enable them to serve in various catalytic applications. We are now working on several related commercial opportunities
using the same materials. We expect that this technique should enable us to scale to large quantity commercial volumes once application
viability and firm demand are established. We also have an ongoing advanced engineering effort that is primarily focused on the
development of new nanomaterials as well as the refinement of existing nanomaterials, as dictated by our customer-driven marketing
strategy. We are not certain when or if any significant revenue will be generated from the production of the materials described
above. 

Research and development
expense was $386,000 and $1,060,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $325,000
and $969,000 for the same periods in 2015. Research and development expense in 2015 reflected reduced activity as projects were
transferred into commercial operations, particularly in surface finishing (polishing). New projects started during 2015 and expanded
during 2016 have slightly increased our spend on salaries, materials, external testing, and patent legal fees. We expect quarterly
research and development expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be consistent with the third quarter of 2016 as we develop and
launch new products in the personal care area. 

Selling, general and administrative
expense was $716,000 and $2,151,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $709,000
and $2,316,000 for the same periods in 2015. The net changes largely reflect the timing of costs associated with marketing and
selling activities. During 2015 we launched new products in the surface finishing (polishing) area, and once completed, had a natural
reduction in spending. During the summer of 2016 we are started to ramp up cost for consultants and materials as we actively market
our personal care and energy solutions to customers. We expect fourth quarter selling, general and administrative expense to increase
by approximately 5% from third quarter 2016 levels as we plan to launch additional products, primarily in personal care. 

Interest income relates
to bank yields on excess funds, while interest expense relates to capital leases. Neither was significant during the reported periods. 

Inflation  

We believe inflation has
not had a material effect on our operations or financial position. However, supplier price increases and wage and benefit inflation,
both of which represent a significant component of our costs of operations, may have a material effect on our operations and financial
position in 2016 and beyond if we are unable to pass through any applicable increases under our present contracts or through to
our markets in general. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments amounted to $1,718,000 on September 30, 2016, compared to $1,275,000 on December 31, 2015 and $1,249,000
on September 30, 2015. The net cash used in our operating activities was $354,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $542,000 for the same period in 2015. The difference is primarily driven by volatility in working capital cash flows
between the periods. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $139,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $236,000 for the same period in 2015. Capital expenditures, including those under capital leases, amounted to $102,000 and $293,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $936,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $165,000 for the same period in 2015, as we sold 2.6 million shares of
our common stock to our largest stockholder on February 10, 2016 for $988,000 in proceeds. We have used, and intend to continue
to use, the proceeds from the sale of shares for working capital and general corporate purposes. On June 29, 2015, we borrowed
$250,000 on our working capital line of credit, repaying that amount on July 3, 2015. We also entered into $65,000 of capital leases
during the second quarter of 2015 related to the purchase of capital equipment. We had no new capital leases during the first nine
months of 2016, but expect to enter into one or more capital leases during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Our supply agreements with
our largest customer, BASF, contain certain financial covenants which could potentially impact our liquidity. The most restrictive
financial covenants under these agreements require that we maintain a minimum of $1 million in cash, cash equivalents and certain
investments, and that we not have the acceleration of any debt maturity having a principal amount of more than $10 million, in
order to avoid triggering the customer s potential right to transfer certain technology and equipment to that customer at
a contractually defined price. We had approximately $1.7 million in cash and cash equivalents on September 30, 2016. This supply
agreement and its covenants are more fully described in Note 7, and our line of credit is more fully described in Note 4, to our
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

We believe that cash from operations and cash,
cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity will be adequate to fund our operating plans through 2016 and into 2017. Our actual
future capital requirements in 2016 and beyond will depend, however, on many factors, including customer acceptance of our current
and potential nanomaterials and product applications, continued progress in research and development activities and product testing
programs, the magnitude of these activities and programs, and the costs necessary to increase and expand our manufacturing capabilities
and to market and sell our materials and product applications. Other important issues that will drive future capital requirements
will be the development of new markets and new customers as well as the potential for significant unplanned growth with existing
customers. Depending on the success of certain projects, we expect that capital spending relating to currently known capital needs
for the remainder of 2016 will be between $100,000 and $125,000. 

Should events arise that make it appropriate
for us to seek additional financing, such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or even at all, and any
such additional financing could be dilutive to our stockholders. Such financing could be necessitated by such things as the loss
of one or more existing customers or a significant decrease in revenue from those customers; currently unknown capital requirements
in light of the factors described above; new regulatory requirements that are outside our control; the need to meet previously
discussed cash requirements to avoid a triggering event under our BASF agreements; or various other circumstances coming to pass
that we currently do not anticipate. The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our business plans may result in a curtailment
or other change in those plans, and under such circumstances may raise doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

On September 30, 2016, we had a net operating
loss carryforward of approximately $81 million for income tax purposes. Because we may have experienced  ownership changes 
within the meaning of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in connection with our various prior equity offerings, future utilization
of this carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. If not utilized, the carryforward
will expire at various dates between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2035. As a result of the annual limitation and uncertainty
as to the amount of future taxable income that will be earned prior to the expiration of the carryforward, we have concluded that
it is likely that some portion of this carryforward will expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce income tax liabilities. 

Changes in Illinois state law that began in
2011 will impact net loss carryforward duration and utilization on the state tax level. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not created, and
are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purposes of raising capital, incurring debt or operating
our business. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our
financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 

As more fully described
in Note 4 to our Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, during July 2014 we entered into a letter of credit
and promissory note for up to $30,000 supporting our obligations under our facility lease agreement. No borrowings have been incurred
under this promissory note. 

Safe Harbor Provision 

We want to provide investors
with more meaningful and useful information. As a result, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Form 10-Q ) contains
and incorporates by reference certain  forward-looking statements , as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). These statements reflect our current expectations of the future results
of our operations, performance and achievements. Forward-looking statements are covered under the safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify these statements by using words
such as  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  expects ,  plans ,
 intends  and similar expressions. These statements reflect management s current beliefs and are based on information
now available to it. Accordingly, these statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and contingencies that could cause
our actual results, performance or achievements in future reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied
by, such statements. These risks, uncertainties and factors include, without limitation: our ability to be consistently profitable
despite the losses we have incurred since our incorporation; a decision by a customer to cancel a purchase order or supply agreement
in light of our dependence on a limited number of key customers; the terms of our supply agreements with BASF, which could trigger
a requirement to transfer technology and/or sell equipment to that customer; our potential inability to obtain working capital
when needed on acceptable terms or at all; our ability to obtain materials at costs we can pass through to our customers; uncertain
demand for, and acceptance of, our nanocrystalline materials; our manufacturing capacity and product mix flexibility in light of
customer demand; our limited marketing experience; changes in development and distribution relationships; the impact of competitive
products and technologies; our dependence on patents and protection of proprietary information; the resolution of litigation or
other legal proceedings in which we may become involved; our ability to maintain an appropriate electronic trading venue for our
securities; and the impact of any potential new governmental regulations that could be difficult to respond to or costly to comply
with. In addition, our forward-looking statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates.
Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as required
by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect new events
or uncertainties.

periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted
that in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and that our
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment regarding the design of our disclosure controls and procedures. As of
the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision (and with the participation) of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
reaching that level of reasonable assurance. 

Internal control over financial reporting

The Company s management,
including the CEO and CFO, confirm that there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during
the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
