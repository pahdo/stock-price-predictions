RadTek, Inc.  
 Consolidated Notes to the Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1   Nature of Business   
   
  (a) Description of Business   
   
 RadTek, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in Nevada on December 18, 2009, under the laws of the State of Nevada, for the purpose of providing management consulting services to the small or median sized private companies in the Taiwan that want to look for business partners, or agencies, or financing resources, or to become public through IPO or reverse merger in the United States, or Canada. 
   
 The Company was a subsidiary of USChina Channel Inc., and spun off on March 15, 2010. As of March 18, 2013 the company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and subsequently with the SEC and FINRA for a name change to RadTek, Inc., change to the Articles of Incorporation. With this the ticker of the company also changed to RDTK and created a class of preferred stock with 10,000,000 shares issuable. No preferred shares have been issued to date. 
   
 On November 26, 2013, the Company acquired RadTek, Co. Ltd. RadTek, Co., Ltd. was incorporated under the laws of Republic of Korea in May 2001, and is engaged in developing and marketing radiation-imaging system and equipment that employ digital radiography technology. The systems offered are primarily in the line of radiation scanning and related engineering services for users in various fields such as biotechnology, medical, product quality control, and security system. The specific product line includes food inspection systems, X-ray diagnosis related systems, baggage and container inspection systems, and radiation safety engineering. As the market in this field is dominated by high-priced systems for large users, the Company aims to focus on the niche market of small users by offering low-cost models.  
   
 On December 31, 2012, RadTek, Co., Ltd. entered into an agreement to acquire a company (a Nevada corporation) listed on  Over-the-Counter  Market of the United States. This transaction was completed in February 2013, and has resulted in the acquisition of 89.6% of the outstanding voting shares of the listed company at the consideration of $367,000 including transaction expenses. All amounts recorded as treasury stock in consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
   
 On November 26, 2013, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with RadTek, Co. Ltd. s shareholders.   Pursuant to the agreement, the Company purchased all of the outstanding securities of the RadTek, Co. Ltd. (1,900,000) in exchange for 95,000,000 common shares of the Company.  RadTek Co. Ltd. shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. RadTek, Co. Ltd. is treated as the  accounting acquirer  in the accompanying financial statements. In the transaction, the Company issued 95,000,000 common shares to the shareholders of RadTek, Co. Ltd.; such shares represented, immediately following the transaction, 94% of the outstanding shares of the Company (excluding treasury stock of 55,375,000 shares).  The transaction was accounted for as a  reverse merger  and a reverse recapitalization and the issuances of common stock were recorded as a reclassification between paid-in-capital and par value of Common Stock. 
   
 On January 15, 2014, the Board of Directors approved to increase authorized common shares from 60,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 to 1,990,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 per common shares and to effectuate a forward split of RadTek s common stock at an exchange ratio of 50 for 1 so that each outstanding common share before the forward split shall represent 50 common shares after the forward split. All share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented. 
   
  (b) Basis of Presentation and Going Concern Considerations  
     
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the  

9 

information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RadTek, Inc. and its 100% owned subsidiary, RadTek, Co. Ltd., a company incorporated in Korea. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
 These consolidated financial statements present the financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows of the operating companies. 
   
 The Company s financial statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has experienced recurring losses over the past years which have resulted in stockholders  accumulated deficits of approximately $3,217 thousand and a working capital deficit of approximately $1,865 thousand at September 30, 2016.  These conditions raise uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to secure additional financing, increase sales of its products and attain profitable operations. It is the intent of management to continue to raise additional capital to sustain operations and to pursue acquisitions of operating companies in order to generate future profits for the Company. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such additional funds or obtain such on terms satisfactory to the Company, if at all. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 
   
  Note 2   Inventories   
   
 Inventories consist of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Note 3   Intangibles   
   
 The Company s intangible assets are composed of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Direct costs incurred in obtaining patents and technical rights are capitalized. These patents and rights are subject to amortization as their lives are statutorily limited in South Korea, typically over the period of twenty years. Accordingly, they are being amortized over the statutory lives. Management considered recoverability of the balances of these assets and determined that no adjustment was necessary as of September 30, 2016.  
   
 Amortization expenses for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $6,827 and $4,445, respectively. 
   
  Note 4   Short-term Borrowings   
   
 Short term borrowings consist of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Note 5- Convertible Note  
   
 On July 27, 2015, the Company issued a $5,000 Convertible Note for services. The Convertible Not bears interest at 9% without a maturity date. The Noteholder shall have the right to convert any unpaid sums into common stock of the Company at the rate of 50% of the lowest trade reported in the 20 days prior to date of conversion. As at December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded interest of $198. The Company paid off convertible note of $5,000 and accrued interest of $233 on February 12, 2016 
   
 The embedded conversion option qualifies for derivative accounting and bifurcation under ASC 815-15  Derivatives and Hedging . The initial fair value of the conversion feature of $5,254 resulted in a discount to the note payable of $5,000 and the remaining $254 was recognized as derivative expense.  
   
  Note 6 Derivative Liabilities  
   
 The embedded conversion option of the Company s convertible debenture contains a conversion feature that qualifies for embedded derivative classification. The fair value of these liabilities will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative liabilities. 
   
 The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities: 
   
        For the nine month ended        
                                September 30, 2016

 Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) Expand our customer base in industries in which we may have an interest, to include X-Ray technology and construction consultation services related to x-ray technology facilities; (ii) Continue reconfiguring our business plans for engaging in the business of our selected industry; and (iii) to expand our contract capacity while completing our expansion of operations through funding and/or our announced acquisition of a going concern engaged in the industry selected. 
   
 Other than standard operations associated with business operations mentioned in subsequent events, during the next 12 months, one of our only foreseeable cash requirements, which may be advanced by our management or principal stockholders as loans to us, will relate to maintaining our good standing or the payment of expenses associated with legal, accounting and other fees related to our compliance with the Exchange Act requirements of being a reporting issuer and reviewing or investigating any potential acquisition or business combination candidate. With our business and industry in which our operations have commenced, and other potential acquisitions have not been identified and any prospective acquisition or business combination candidate as of the date of this Quarterly Report, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such costs or required advances. Any such loan will be on terms no less favorable to us than would have been made available to us from a commercial lender in an arm's length transaction.
