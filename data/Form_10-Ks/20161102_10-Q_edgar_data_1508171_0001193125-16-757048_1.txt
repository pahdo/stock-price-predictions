   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)        September 30, 2016        (in thousands, except share amounts)    
   Note 1. Organization    
  Solar Senior Capital Ltd. ( Solar Senior , the  Company ,  SUNS ,  we ,  us , or
 our ), a Maryland corporation formed on December 16, 2010, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  1940 Act ). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 946. In addition, for tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ), under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( the Code ).   
  On January 28, 2011, Solar Senior was capitalized with initial equity of $2 and commenced operations. On February 24, 2011,
Solar Senior priced its initial public offering, selling 9.0 million shares, including the underwriters  over-allotment, at a price of $20.00 per share. Concurrent with this offering, our senior management team purchased an additional
500,000 shares through a private placement, also at $20.00 per share.      The Company s investment objective is to seek to
maximize current income consistent with the preservation of capital. We seek to achieve our investment objective by directly or indirectly investing primarily in senior secured loans, including first lien and second lien debt instruments, made
primarily to leveraged private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, which the Company refers to collectively as  senior loans.  From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly
traded. Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the value of the Company s net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested in senior loans.   
   Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies       The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), and include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the
operations and financial condition for the periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.   
  Interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the
requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X, as appropriate. Accordingly, they may not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and
any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The current period s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal
year ending on December 31, 2016.      In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature
considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements, have been included.      The significant accounting
policies consistently followed by the Company are:       

(a)  
  Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date;

(b)  
  The Company conducts the valuation of its assets in accordance with GAAP and the 1940 Act. The Company generally values its assets on a quarterly basis, or more
frequently if required. Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price on the date of valuation. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments from pricing
services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, management determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to GAAP to determine the fair value of the investment. If determined adequate, the Company uses the
quote obtained. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of Solar Capital
Partners, LLC (the  Investment Adviser ), does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Company s board of directors (the
 Board ).        Investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the
pricing sources do not provide a valuation or methodology or provide a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board does not represent fair value, shall be valued as follows: (i) each portfolio company
or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuations are discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser; (iii) independent valuation firms
engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals and review the Investment Adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment for (a) each portfolio investment that, when taken together
with all other investments in the same portfolio company, exceeds 10% of estimated total assets, plus available borrowings, as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, and (b) each portfolio investment that is presently in
payment default; (iv) the Board will discuss the valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where appropriate, the respective independent valuation
firm.      The recommendation of fair value generally considers the following factors among others, as relevant: applicable market
yields; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments; the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flow; the markets in which the issuer does business; and comparisons to
publicly traded securities, among others.      When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent
equity sale occurs, the Company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value,
the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.   
  Investments are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. However, in accordance with
ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946, may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by
market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount
(discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include,
as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables,   
         14

   September 30, 2016        (in thousands, except share amounts)        
   
applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments,
its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available,
broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. Escrow receivables, if any, included in the receivables for investments sold in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and
Liabilities are reviewed quarterly and the value of the receivable is adjusted as necessary. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change to the Company s valuation techniques and the nature of the related inputs
considered in the valuation process.      ASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following
hierarchy:       Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at
the measurement date.       Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.   
   Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.      In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The exercise of judgment is based in part on our knowledge of
the asset class and our prior experience.       

(c)  
  Gains or losses on investments are calculated by using the specific identification method.     

(d)  
  The Company records dividend income and interest, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Loan origination fees, original
issue discount, and market discounts are capitalized and we amortize such amounts into income using the effective interest method or on a straight-line basis, as applicable. Upon the prepayment of a loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are
recorded as interest income. We record call premiums on loans repaid as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees, amendment fees, consent fees, and any other non-recurring fee income as well as management fee and other
fee income for services rendered, if any, are recorded as other income when earned.         

(e)  
  The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code pertaining to regulated investment companies to make distributions of taxable
income sufficient to relieve it of substantially all U.S. federal income taxes. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. The Company will accrue
excise tax on such estimated excess taxable income as appropriate.         

(f)  
  Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are typically reclassified among the Company s
capital accounts annually. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP.     

(g)  
  Distributions to common stockholders are recorded as of the record date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board. Net realized capital
gains, if any, are generally distributed or deemed distributed at least annually.

subsidiaries and certain wholly-owned holding companies that serve to facilitate investment in portfolio companies. In addition, the Company may also consolidate any controlled operating companies substantially all of whose business consists of
providing services to the Company.         

(i)  
  The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars
based on the rate of exchange of such currencies against the U.S. dollar on the date of valuation. The Company will not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the
fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations would be included with the net unrealized gain or loss from investments. The Company s investments in foreign securities, if any, may involve certain
risks, including without limitation: foreign exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic risks, all of which could affect the market and/or credit risk of the investment. In addition, changes in the
relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect the value of these investments in terms of U.S. dollars and therefore the earnings of the Company.     

(j)  
  The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to its senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit
Facility ), in accordance with ASC 825-10. The Company uses an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in measuring its fair value.         

(k)  
  In accordance with ASC 835-30, the Company records origination and other expenses related to certain debt issuances, if any, as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of the debt liability. These expenses are deferred and amortized using either the effective interest method or the straight-line method over the stated life. The straight-line method may be used on revolving facilities and when it
approximates the effective yield method.         

(l)  
  The Company records expenses related to shelf registration statements and applicable equity offering costs as prepaid assets. These expenses are typically charged as a
reduction of capital upon utilization, in accordance with ASC 946-20-25. Certain subsequent costs are expensed per the AICPA Audit   Accounting Guide for Investment Companies.     

(m)  
  Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest cash payments are past
due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and in
management s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining principal and interest obligations. Cash interest payments received on such investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending on
management s judgment.         

(n)  
  The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant
risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company believes that certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements
and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents.        Recent Accounting
Pronouncements      In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic

reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-02 for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-02 has not had a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-03 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU
2015-03 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-03 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The update eliminates the requirement to categorize
investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASB s fair value measurement guidance. Public companies are required to apply
ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-07 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU
2015-07 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       Note 3. Agreements    
  Solar Senior has an Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser, under which the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations
of, and provides investment advisory services to, Solar Senior. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Solar Senior, consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management
fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of gross assets. For services rendered under the Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross
assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. For purposes of computing the base management fee, gross assets exclude temporary assets
acquired at the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility in the next fiscal quarter. Temporary assets include, but are not limited to, U.S. treasury bills, other short-term U.S. government or government agency
securities, repurchase agreements or cash borrowings.      The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one is calculated and
payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income
(other than fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments, if
any, with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not
include any realized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar
quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 1.75% per quarter (7.00%

annualized). The Company pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income for each calendar quarter as follows:   

no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 1.75%;

50% of pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the
hurdle but is less than 2.9167% in any calendar quarter (11.67% annualized);         and   

20% of the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.9167% in any calendar quarter (11.67% annualized) will be payable
to the Investment Adviser.         The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of
the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and will equal 20% of the Company s cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized
capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all net capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the
Investment Adviser. For financial statement purposes, the second part of the incentive fee is accrued based upon 20% of cumulative net realized gains and net unrealized capital appreciation. No accrual was required for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $852 and
$2,483, respectively, in base management fees and $636 and $1,486, respectively, in performance-based incentive fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $518 and $1,131, respectively, of such performance-based incentive fees
were waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $882 and $2,627, respectively, in base management fees and $115 and $272, respectively, in performance-based incentive fees. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, $115 and $272, respectively, of such performance-based incentive fees were waived. The voluntary fee waiver for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was made at the Investment Adviser s discretion and is
subject to recapture by the Investment Adviser and reimbursement by the Company should net investment income during and/or for fiscal 2016 equal or exceed distributions declared in fiscal 2016. The voluntary fee waiver for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was made at the Investment Adviser s discretion and was not subject to recapture by the Investment Adviser or reimbursement by the Company.      Solar Senior has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Solar Capital Management, LLC (the  Administrator ) under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Solar
Senior. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Solar Senior reimburses the Administrator for Solar Senior s allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the
Administration Agreement, including rent. The Administrator will also provide, on Solar Senior s behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which Solar Senior is required to provide such assistance.   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized expenses under the Administration Agreement of $301 and
$895, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized expenses under the Administration Agreement of $309 and $845, respectively. No managerial assistance fees were accrued or collected for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

    Note 4. Net Asset Value Per Share    
  At September 30, 2016, the Company s total net assets and net asset value per share were $268,866 and $16.78, respectively. This

     Note 6. Fair Value       Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a
framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   
   Level     1.  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical
assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.   
   Level     2.  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not
active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:   

a)  
  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;         

b)  
  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;     

c)  
  Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and     

d)  
  Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability.         Level     3.  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are
based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s and, if applicable, an independent third-party valuation firm s
own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

   September 30, 2016        (in thousands, except share amounts)        
   When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the
hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs
that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).      Gains and losses for assets and liabilities
categorized within the Level 3 table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3).   
  A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may
result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out of the appropriate category as of the end of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur.   
  The following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of September 30, 2016

    During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our investment in CT Technologies Intermediate Holdings

     Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements     
  The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a
price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to current contractual interest rates, relative maturities and other
key terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a significant determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of
our investment within each portfolio company.      Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value
measurement of the Company s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily reflect current market yields, including indices, and readily available quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable assets and liabilities,
as well as enterprise values, returns on equity and earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) multiples of similar companies, and comparable market transactions for equity securities.   
  Quantitative information about the Company s Level 3 asset and liability fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016 is
summarized in the table below:       
    Significant increases or decreases in any of the above unobservable inputs in isolation, including
unobservable inputs used in deriving bid-ask spreads, if applicable, would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement for such assets and liabilities.      Quantitative information about the Company s Level 3 asset and liability fair value measurements as of December 31, 2015 is summarized in the table below:   
   
    Significant increases or decreases in any of the above unobservable inputs in isolation, including

    Note 7. Debt        Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility  On August 26, 2011, the Company established SUNS SPV, LLC ( SUNS SPV ) which entered into the $200,000 Credit Facility with Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. acting as administrative agent. The Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on August 26, 2016 and generally bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Credit Facility can also be expanded up to $600,000 and is
secured by all of the assets held by the SUNS SPV. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Solar Senior and the SUNS SPV, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various covenants,
including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Credit Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. On November 7,
2012, the Company amended the Credit Facility. As a result of the amendment, the stated interest rate on the Credit Facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00% from LIBOR plus 2.25%, and the Credit Facility continues to have no LIBOR floor requirement.
The amendment also provided us greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to November 6, 2017. On February 26, 2014, the Company utilized the Credit Facility s delayed draw feature, expanding immediately
available capital from $150,000 to $200,000, subject to borrowing base limitations. On June 30, 2014, the Company again amended the Credit Facility. As a result of this amendment, commitments under the Credit Facility were reduced by $25,000 to
$175,000 and may be expanded up to $600,000 under its accordion feature. This amendment to the Credit Facility also added greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to June 28, 2019. The stated interest rate remains
LIBOR plus 2.00% with no LIBOR floor requirement. On May 29, 2015, the Company entered into another amendment to the Credit Facility. This amendment added greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to June 30, 2020.
     The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to the Credit Facility, in
accordance with ASC 825-10. We believe accounting for the Credit Facility at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings volatility. ASC 825-10 requires entities to display
the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facility are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
  The average annualized interest cost for all borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31,
2015 was 2.56% and 2.25%, respectively. These costs are exclusive of other credit facility expenses such as unused fees and fees paid to the back-up servicer, if any. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31,
2015, the Company expensed $0 and $829 in conjunction with amendments to the Credit Facility. The maximum amount borrowed on the Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, was $141,600
and $148,600, respectively.

   Information about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each year
ended December 31 since the Company commenced operations, unless otherwise noted. The     indicates information which the SEC expressly does not require to be disclosed for certain types of senior securities.   

(1)  
  Total amount of each class of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented.     

(2)  
  The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and
indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by senior securities representing indebtedness. This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by one thousand to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. In order to determine the specific Asset
Coverage Per Unit for each class of debt, the total Asset Coverage Per Unit was divided based on the amount outstanding at the end of the period for each. As of September 30, 2016, asset coverage was 725.3%.

  Not applicable, we do not have senior securities that are registered for public trading.         Note 9. Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC       We acquired Gemino Healthcare
Finance, LLC (d/b/a Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare Finance) ( Gemino ) on September 30, 2013. Gemino is a commercial finance company that originates, underwrites, and manages primarily secured, asset-based loans for small and mid-sized
companies operating in the healthcare industry. Our initial investment in Gemino was $32,839. The management team of Gemino co-invested in the transaction and continues to lead Gemino.  
  Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, Gemino entered into a new, four-year, non-recourse, $100,000 credit facility with

However, our financial statements, including our schedule of investments, reflect our investments in Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare on a consolidated basis. Gemino s management team currently owns approximately 6% of the equity in Gemino.

respectively, of capital to the joint venture. All portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the FLLP must be approved by an investment committee of the FLLP consisting
of representatives of the Company and Voya (with approval from a representative of each required). On February 13, 2015, FLLP commenced operations. On February 13, 2015, FLLP as transferor and FLLP 2015-1, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary
of FLLP, as borrower entered into a $75,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the  FLLP Facility ) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acting as administrative agent. Solar Senior Capital Ltd. acts as servicer under the FLLP
Facility. The FLLP Facility was scheduled to mature on February 13, 2020. The FLLP Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a range of 2.25%-2.50%. FLLP and FLLP 2015-1, LLC, as applicable, have made certain customary
representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The FLLP Facility also includes usual and
customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. On August 15, 2016, the FLLP Facility was amended, expanding commitments to $100,000 and extending the maturity date to August 16, 2021. There were $69,893 of borrowings outstanding
as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Solar Senior and Voya contributed combined equity capital in the amount of $36,009 and $33,810, respectively. Of the $36,009 of contributed equity capital, the Company
contributed $29,584 in the form of investments and $1,924 in the form of cash and Voya contributed $4,501 in the form of cash. As of September 30, 2016, Solar Senior and Voya s remaining commitments totaled $19,242 and $2,749, respectively. The
Company, along with Voya, controls the funding of FLLP and FLLP may not call the unfunded commitments without approval of both the Company and Voya.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, FLLP had total assets of $109,914 and $76,788, respectively. For the same periods, FLLP s portfolio consisted of first lien floating rate senior
secured loans to 23 and 15 different borrowers, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FLLP invested $15,840 across 3 portfolio companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, FLLP invested $21,478 across 3 portfolio
companies. Investments prepaid totaled $495 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $482 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average yield of FLLP s portfolio was 6.5% and

      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
      The Board of Directors and Stockholders      Solar Senior Capital Ltd.:      We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated
statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, of Solar Senior Capital Ltd. (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations for the three-month and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the related consolidated statement of changes in net assets for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.      We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.      Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.      We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, of Solar Senior Capital Ltd., as of December 31, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our report dated February 24, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

  We generally use words such as  anticipates,   believes,   expects,   intends  and similar
expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including any factors set forth in  Risk Factors  and elsewhere in this

are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including any annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form
8-K.       Overview    
  Solar Senior Capital Ltd. ( Solar Senior , the  Company ,  we  or  our ), a Maryland corporation
formed in December 2010, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the  1940 Act ). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic
946. In addition, for tax purposes, the Company has elected to be regulated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).   
  On February 24, 2011, we priced our initial public offering, selling 9.0 million shares, including the underwriters 
over-allotment, at a price of $20.00 per share. Concurrent with this offering, our senior management team purchased an additional 500,000 shares through a concurrent private placement, also at $20.00 per share.   
  On August 26, 2011, the Company established SUNS SPV, LLC ( SUNS SPV ) which entered into a $200 million senior secured
revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. acting   
         34   

Table of Contents  

as administrative agent. The Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on August 26, 2016 and generally bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 2.25%. The
Credit Facility had $150 million immediately available with an additional $50 million available under a delayed draw feature. The Credit Facility can also be expanded up to $600 million and is secured by all of the assets held by the SUNS SPV. Under
the terms of the Credit Facility, Solar Senior and the SUNS SPV, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements
and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Credit Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. On November 7, 2012, we amended our Credit Facility. As a result of
the amendment, the stated interest rate on the Credit Facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00% from LIBOR plus 2.25%, and the Credit Facility continues to have no LIBOR floor requirement. The amendment also provided us greater investment flexibility
and extended the final maturity date to November 6, 2017. On June 30, 2014, the Company again amended the Credit Facility. As a result of this amendment, commitments under the Credit Facility were reduced by $25 million to $175 million and
may be expanded up to $600 million under its accordion feature. This amendment to the Credit Facility also added greater investment flexibility and extends the final maturity date to June 28, 2019. The stated interest rate remains LIBOR plus
2.00% with no LIBOR floor requirement. On May 29, 2015, the Company entered into another amendment to the Credit Facility. This amendment added greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to June 30, 2020.   
  We invest primarily in U.S. middle market companies, where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment
opportunities are most attractive. Our investment objective is to seek to maximize current income consistent with the preservation of capital. We seek to achieve our investment objective by directly and indirectly investing primarily in senior
loans, including first lien and second lien debt instruments, made to private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, which we refer to collectively as  senior loans.  We may also invest in debt of public
companies that are thinly traded. Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the value of our net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested in senior loans. Senior loans typically pay interest at
rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, primarily LIBOR, plus a premium. Senior loans in which we expect to invest are typically made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships
and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. Senior loans typically are rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as  leveraged loans  or
 high yield  securities, and may be considered  high risk  compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade.      We expect to invest in senior loans made primarily to private, leveraged middle-market companies with approximately $20 million to $100 million of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and
amortization ( EBITDA ). Our business model is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. We expect that our direct investments will generally range between $5
million and $30 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or with strategic initiatives. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of
investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns. These opportunistic investments may include, but are not limited to, direct investments in public companies
that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States. We may invest up to 30% of our total assets in such opportunistic investments, including senior loans issued by non-U.S.
issuers, subject to compliance with our regulatory obligations as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Our investment activities are managed by Solar Capital Partners, LLC (the  Investment Adviser ) and supervised by our board of directors, a
majority of whom are non-interested, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act. Solar Capital Management, LLC (the  Administrator ) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate.   
         35   

Table of Contents  

   As of September 30, 2016, the Investment Adviser has invested approximately $5.8 billion in
more than 255 different portfolio companies since 2006. Over the same period, the Investment Adviser completed transactions with more than 165 different financial sponsors.       Recent Developments       On October 5, 2016, the Board declared a monthly
distribution of $0.1175 per share payable on November 1, 2016 to holders of record as of October 20, 2016.      On November
2, 2016, the Board declared a monthly distribution of $0.1175 per share payable on December 1, 2016 to holders of record as of November 23, 2016.        Investments        Our level of investment activity can and does vary
substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment
and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total
assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  The definition of  eligible portfolio company  includes certain public companies
that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million.  
    Revenue        We
generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may sell. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of three to seven years and
typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ), commercial paper rate, or the prime rate. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly
but may be monthly or semi-annually. In addition, our investments may provide payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest. Such amounts of accrued PIK interest are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and
generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable,
consulting fees, etc.        Expenses        All investment professionals of the investment adviser and their respective staffs, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and
routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by Solar Capital Partners. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation):   

the cost of our organization and public offerings;          

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;      

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our shares and other securities;      

interest payable on debt, if any, to finance our investments;      

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence
reviews of prospective investments and advisory fees;

all other expenses incurred by either Solar Capital Management or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the
Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Solar Capital Management in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses
associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer and our chief financial officer and any administrative support staff.
        We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase
moderately in dollar terms. During periods of asset growth, we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest
expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance, interest rate benchmarks, and offerings of our securities relative to comparative
periods, among other factors.       Portfolio and Investment Activity    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we invested $21.4 million across 4 portfolio companies. This compares to investing $5.3
million in 2 portfolio companies for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Investment sales, prepayments and repayments during the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $20.5 million versus $7.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.      At September 30, 2016, our portfolio consisted of 49 portfolio companies and was invested 80.3% in senior
secured loans and 19.7% in common equity (of which 10.7% is Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC and 8.9% is First Lien Loan Program LLC) measured at fair value versus 47 portfolio companies invested 80.5% in senior secured loans, 1.0% in unsecured loans
and 18.5% in common equity/equity interests (of which 10.2% is Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC and 8.3% is First Lien Loan Program LLC) at September 30, 2015.      The weighted average yields on our income producing portfolio of investments were 8.2% and 7.2%, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and 2015 measured at fair value, and 8.0% and 7.3%, respectively for
the same periods, measured at amortized cost.      At September 30, 2016, 96.3% of our $315.6 million income producing investment
portfolio* was floating rate and 3.7% or $12.2 million was fixed rate, measured at fair value. At September 30, 2015, 94.5% or $320.8 million of our income producing investment portfolio* was floating rate and 5.5% or $18.7 million was fixed rate,
measured at fair value.

  We have included First Lien Loan Program LLC and Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC as 100% floating rate within our income producing investment portfolio.
        Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC       We acquired Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC (d/b/a Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare Finance) ( Gemino ) on September 30, 2013. Gemino is a commercial finance company that originates, underwrites,
and manages primarily secured, asset-based loans for small and mid-sized companies operating in the healthcare industry. Our initial investment in Gemino was $32.8 million. The management team of Gemino co-invested in the transaction and continues
to lead Gemino.     Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, Gemino entered into a new, four-year, non-recourse, $100.0
million credit facility with non-affiliates, which was expandable to $150.0 million under its accordion feature. Effective March 31, 2014, the credit facility was expanded to $105.0 million and again on June 27, 2014 to $110.0 million. On May 27,
2016, Gemino entered into a new $125.0 million credit facility which replaced the previously existing facility. The new facility has similar terms as compared to the previous facility and includes an accordion feature increase to $200.0 million and
has a maturity date of May 27, 2020.      On December 31, 2013, we contributed our 32,839 units in Gemino to Gemino Senior Secured
Healthcare LLC ( Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare ). In exchange for this contribution, we received 19,839 units of equity interests and $13.0 million in floating rate secured notes of Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare bearing interest at
LIBOR plus 7.50%, maturing on December 31, 2018. However, our financial statements, including our schedule of investments, reflect our investments in Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare on a consolidated basis. Gemino s management team currently
owns approximately 6% of the equity in Gemino. Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare owns approximately 94% of the equity in Gemino and Solar Senior owns 100% of the equity in Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare. Gemino and Gemino Senior Secured Healthcare
are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.      Gemino currently manages a highly diverse portfolio of
directly-originated and underwritten senior-secured commitments. As of September 30, 2016, the portfolio totaled approximately $196.1 million of commitments, of which $119.9 million were funded, on total assets of $117.3 million. As of December
31, 2015, the portfolio totaled approximately $188.3 million of commitments, of which $130.6 million were funded, on total assets of $133.7 million. At September 30, 2016, the portfolio consisted of 37 issuers with an average balance of
approximately $3.2 million versus 36 issuers with an average balance of approximately $3.6 million at December 31, 2015. All of the commitments in Gemino s portfolio are floating-rate, senior-secured, cash-pay loans. Gemino s credit
facility, which is non-recourse to us, had approximately $82.0 million and $98.5 million of borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Gemino had net
income of $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, on gross income of $3.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Gemino had net income of $0.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, on
gross income of $3.2 million and $9.2 million, respectively. Due to timing and non-cash items, there may be material differences between GAAP net income and cash available for distributions. As of September 30, 2016, and based upon our
expectations for Gemino s portfolio performance, we believe that Gemino will be able to maintain its dividend payments to the Company.   
   First Lien Loan Program LLC       On September 10, 2014, the Company entered into a limited liability company agreement to create a First Lien Loan Program ( FLLP ) with Voya Investment Management LLC ( Voya ). Voya
acts as the investment   
         38

advisor for several wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries of Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA). The joint venture vehicle, structured as an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company, is
expected to invest primarily in senior secured floating rate term loans to middle market companies predominantly owned by private equity sponsors or entrepreneurs. Solar Senior and Voya have committed to provide $50.75 million and $7.25 million,
respectively, of capital to the joint venture. All portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the FLLP must be approved by an investment committee of the FLLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Voya (with
approval from a representative of each required). On February 13, 2015, FLLP commenced operations. On February 13, 2015, FLLP as transferor and FLLP 2015-1, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of FLLP, as borrower entered into a $75.0
million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  FLLP Facility ) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acting as administrative agent. Solar Senior Capital Ltd. acts as servicer under the FLLP Facility. The FLLP Facility was
scheduled to mature on February 13, 2020. The FLLP Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a range of 2.25%-2.50%. FLLP and FLLP 2015-1, LLC, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and
are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The FLLP Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit
facilities of this nature. On August 15, 2016, the FLLP Facility was amended, expanding commitments to $100.0 million and extending the maturity date to August 16, 2021. There were $69.9 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 30,
2016. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Solar Senior and Voya contributed combined equity capital in the amount of $36.0 million and $33.8 million, respectively. Of the $36.0 million of contributed equity capital, the Company
contributed $29.6 million in the form of investments and $1.9 million in the form of cash and Voya contributed $4.5 million in the form of cash. As of September 30, 2016, Solar Senior and Voya s remaining commitments totaled $19.2 million and
$2.7 million, respectively. The Company, along with Voya, controls the funding of FLLP and FLLP may not call the unfunded commitments without approval of both the Company and Voya.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, FLLP had total assets of $109.9 million and $76.8 million, respectively. For the same
periods, FLLP s portfolio consisted of first lien floating rate senior secured loans to 23 and 15 different borrowers, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FLLP invested $15.8 million across 3 portfolio companies. For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, FLLP invested $21.5 million across 3 portfolio companies. Investments prepaid totaled $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average yield of FLLP s portfolio was 6.5% and 6.3%, respectively, measured at fair value and 6.4% and 6.2%, respectively, measured at cost.

    Critical Accounting Policies       The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified
the following items as critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies and disclosed subsequent events herein, we are not currently aware of any other reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result
in materially different amounts being reported.        Valuation of Portfolio Investments     
  We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined, at all times consistent with GAAP, and the
1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:      The Company conducts the valuation of its assets in
accordance with GAAP and the 1940 Act. The Company generally values its assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required. Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price on the
date of valuation. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, management determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient
according to GAAP to determine the fair value of the investment. If determined adequate, the Company uses the quote obtained. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized
premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or
under the direction of the Company s board of directors (the  Board ).      Investments for which reliable market
quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing sources do not provide a valuation or methodology or provide a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board does not represent fair value, each
shall be valued as follows: (i) each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuations are discussed with senior management of the
Investment Adviser; (iii) independent valuation firms engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals and review the Investment Adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment for
(a) each portfolio investment that, when taken together with all other investments in the same portfolio company, exceeds 10% of estimated total assets, plus available borrowings, as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, and
(b) each portfolio investment that is presently in payment default; (iv) the Board will discuss the valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and,
where appropriate, the respective independent valuation firm.      The recommendation of fair value generally considers the
following factors among others, as relevant: applicable market yields; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments; the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flow; the
markets in which the issuer does business; and comparisons to publicly traded securities, among others.      When an external
event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value
of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the
differences could be material.      Investments are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as
appropriate. However, in accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in   
         43   

Table of Contents  

accordance with ASC 946, may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The
measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant:
available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral,
the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and
enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. Escrow receivables, if any, included in the receivables for investments
sold in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities are reviewed quarterly and the value of the receivable is adjusted as necessary. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change to the Company s valuation
techniques and the nature of the related inputs considered in the valuation process.      Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:       Level
1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at the measurement date.   
   Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.       Level 3 : Unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability.      In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value
measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The exercise of judgment is based in part on our knowledge of the asset class and our prior experience.      Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such
valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.        Valuation of Credit Facility
       The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to the Credit Facility, in
accordance with ASC 825-10. We believe accounting for the Credit Facility at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings volatility.   
    Revenue Recognition        The Company records dividend income and interest, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest
and/or dividends in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest/dividend cash payments are past due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest/dividend cash payments will be
collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash, and in management s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their
  
         44   

Table of Contents  

remaining interest or dividend obligations. Interest or dividend cash payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s
judgment. Some of our investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK interest and dividends computed at the contractual rate are accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer
issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities
issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at the maturity of the investment or upon
the investment being called by the issuer. At the point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued,
uncapitalized interest or dividends is reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the
fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if the Company again believes that PIK is expected to be realized. Loan origination fees, original issue discount,
and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method or straight-line, as applicable. Upon the prepayment of a loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment
premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned.      The typically higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities, to the extent we invested, reflects the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such
investments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the
value of any associated collateral. PIK interest has the effect of generating investment income and increasing the incentive fees payable at a compounding rate. In addition, the deferral of PIK interest also increases the loan-to-value ratio at a
compounding rate. PIK securities create the risk that incentive fees will be paid to the Investment Adviser based on non-cash accruals that ultimately may not be realized, but the Investment Adviser will be under no obligation to reimburse the
Company for these fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, capitalized PIK income totaled $0.0 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, capitalized PIK income
totaled less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.        Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss
       We generally measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and
the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized origination or commitment fees and prepayment penalties. The net change in unrealized gain or
loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gains or losses are realized. Gains or losses on investments are calculated by using the
specific identification method.       Income Taxes       Solar Senior Capital, a U.S. corporation, has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for taxation as a RIC, the Company is required, among other things, to
timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a given tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in
excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated
current year distributions, the Company accrues an estimated excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis. The update changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-02 for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-02 has not had a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-03 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU
2015-03 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-03 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The update eliminates the requirement to categorize
investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASB s fair value measurement guidance. Public companies are required to apply
ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-07 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU
2015-07 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
  Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:   
   Investment Income       For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross investment income totaled $7.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, gross investment income totaled $6.5 million and $19.3 million,
respectively. The increase in gross investment income year over year was primarily due to the continued ramp-up of the FLLP portfolio partially offset by a smaller average portfolio size year over year.   
   Expenses       Net expenses
totaled $2.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, of which $1.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were base management fees and gross performance-based incentive fees and $0.9 million
and $2.6 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Over the same periods, $0.5 million and $1.1 million of performance-based incentive fees were waived. Administrative services and other general and administrative
expenses totaled $0.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net expenses totaled $2.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, of which
$1.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, were base management fees and gross performance-based incentive fees and $0.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Over the same periods, $0.1 million
and $0.3 million of performance-based incentive fees were waived. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Expenses generally consist of management fees, performance-based   
         46   

Table of Contents  

incentive fees, administrative services expenses, insurance, legal expenses, directors  expenses, audit and tax expenses, transfer agent fees and expenses, and other general and
administrative expenses. Interest and other credit facility expenses generally consist of interest, unused fees, agency fees and loan origination fees, if any, among others. For the nine month period, the decrease in net expenses year over year is
primarily due to costs incurred in 2015 from an amendment to the Credit Facility. The Investment Adviser, at its discretion, may in the future continue to fully or partially waive incentive fees. Any such waiver is subject to recapture by the
Investment Adviser and reimbursement by the Company should net investment income during and/or for fiscal 2016 equal or exceed distributions declared in fiscal 2016.       Net Investment Income       The Company s net investment income totaled
$4.5 million and $12.7 million, or $0.37 and $1.07, per average share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s net investment income totaled $4.1 million and $11.3 million, or $0.35 and $0.98, per
average share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Net Realized Gain    
  The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling approximately $20.5 million and $59.5 million, respectively, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net realized gains over the same periods were $0.01 million and $0.04 million, respectively. The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling approximately $7.7 million and $96.1 million, respectively,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net realized gains over the same periods were $0.04 million and $0.09 million, respectively. Net realized gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015
were primarily related to partial or complete sales of select investments.      Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss)    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the Company s assets and liabilities
totaled $0.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the Company s assets and liabilities totaled ($5.6) million and ($5.9) million, respectively.
Net unrealized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to appreciation in the value of our investments in American Teleconferencing Services, Inc., Securus Technologies, Inc., Gemino and Global Tel*Link Corporation
partially offset by depreciation in FLLP, Hostway Corporation, Metamorph US 3, LLC, Trident USA Health Services and Engineering Solutions   Products, LLC, among others. Net unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is
primarily due to appreciation in the value of our investments in Securus Technologies, Inc., Gemino, Global Tel*Link Corporation, American Teleconferencing Services, Inc. and Asurion, LLC, among others, partially offset by depreciation in Trident
USA Health Services, Hostway Corporation, TwentyEighty, Inc. and Metamorph US 3, LLC, among others. Net unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to depreciation in the value of our investments in Gemino
Healthcare Finance LLC, Metamorph US 3, LLC (Metalogix), First Lien Loan Program LLC and Securus Technologies, Inc., among others, partially offset by appreciation in AmeriQual Group, LLC, among others. Net unrealized loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 is primarily due to depreciation in the value of our investments in First Lien Loan Program LLC, Securus Technologies, Inc, Metamorph US 3, LLC (Metalogix) and Engineering Solutions   Products, LLC, among others, partially
offset by appreciation in AmeriQual Group, LLC, among others.       Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $5.2
million and $18.3 million, respectively. For the same periods, earnings per average share were $0.42 and $1.55, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting
from operations of ($1.5) million and $5.5 million, respectively. For the same periods, earnings (loss) per average share were ($0.13) and $0.48, respectively.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    
  The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generally available through its Credit Facility, through periodic follow-on equity
offerings, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales and pre-payments of investments. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $43.0 million in borrowings outstanding on its Credit Facility and $132.0 million of unused capacity,
subject to borrowing base limits.     In September 2016, the Company closed a follow-on public equity offering of 4.5 million
shares of common stock at $16.76 per share raising approximately $75.0 million in net proceeds. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital, among other considerations. The primary uses of funds will be investments in
portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such
issuance will occur or be successful.      We currently expect that our liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from
operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, including its accordion feature, as well as from other available financing activities.   
   Cash Equivalents       We
deem certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities as cash equivalents. The Company makes purchases that are consistent with its purpose of making investments in securities described in
paragraphs 1 through 3 of Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. From time to time, including at or near the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider using various temporary investment strategies for our business. One strategy includes taking proactive steps
by utilizing cash equivalents as temporary assets with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, from time-to-time we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills or other high-quality,
short-term debt securities at or near the end of the quarter and typically close out the position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. We may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on
our credit facilities, as deemed appropriate. The amount of these transactions or such drawn cash for this purpose is excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. We held
approximately $185 million in cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.       Debt    
   Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility  On August 26, 2011, the Company established the SUNS SPV which entered into the
Credit Facility with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. acting as administrative agent. The Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on August 26, 2016 and generally bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Credit Facility can also be
expanded up to $600 million and is secured by all of the assets held by the SUNS SPV. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Solar Senior and the SUNS SPV, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and are required
to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Credit Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities
of this nature. On November 7, 2012, we amended our Credit Facility. As a result of the amendment, the stated interest rate on the Credit Facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00% from LIBOR plus 2.25%, and the Credit Facility continues to have
no LIBOR floor requirement. The amendment also provided us greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to November 6, 2017. On February 26, 2014, the Company utilized the Credit Facility s delayed draw feature,
expanding immediately available capital from $150.0 million to $200.0 million, subject to borrowing base limitations. On June 30, 2014, the Company again amended the Credit Facility. As a result of this amendment, commitments under the Credit
Facility were reduced by $25.0 million to $175.0 million and may be expanded up to $600.0 million under its accordion feature. This amendment to the Credit Facility also added greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to
June 28, 2019. The stated interest rate remains LIBOR plus 2.00% with no LIBOR floor requirement. On May 29, 2015, the Company entered into   
         48   

Table of Contents  

another amendment to the Credit Facility. This amendment added greater investment flexibility and extended the final maturity date to June 30, 2020. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in
compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Credit Facility.        Contractual Obligations

Information about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each year ended December 31 since the Company commenced operations, unless otherwise noted. The    
indicates information which the SEC expressly does not require to be disclosed for certain types of senior securities.       

(1)  
  Total amount of each class of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented.     

(2)  
  The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and
indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by senior securities representing indebtedness. This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by one thousand to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. In order to determine the specific Asset
Coverage Per Unit for each class of debt, the total Asset Coverage Per Unit was divided based on the amount outstanding at the end of the period for each. As of September 30, 2016, asset coverage was 725.3%.     

(3)  
  The amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled upon the involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to any security junior to it.

(4)  
  Not applicable, we do not have senior securities that are registered for public trading.     
  We have also entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which Solar Capital
Partners, LLC has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which Solar Capital Management, LLC has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our
day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our
average gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under the
Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Either party may terminate each of the
Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement without penalty upon 60 days  written notice to the other. See note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

   On September 10, 2014, FLLP entered into a servicing agreement with the Company. FLLP
engaged and retained the Company to provide certain administrative services relating to the facilities, supplies and necessary ongoing overhead support services for the operation of FLLP s ongoing business affairs in exchange for a fee. Either
party may terminate this agreement upon 30 days  written notice to the other.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     
  The Company had unfunded debt and equity commitments to delayed draw and revolving loans as well as to Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC. The
total amount of these unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is $8.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively, comprised of the following:       

*  
  The Company controls the funding of the Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC commitment and may cancel it at its discretion (also see First Lien Loan Program LLC section in
Item 7).        As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had sufficient cash available and/or
liquid securities available to fund its commitments as well as the commitment to FLLP disclosed earlier.     In the normal course
of its business, we invest or trade in various financial instruments and may enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk, which may include forward foreign currency contracts. Generally, these financial instruments represent
future commitments to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at future dates. These financial instruments contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market value or our satisfaction of the
obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

     Distributions        The following table reflects the cash distributions per share on our common stock for the two most recent fiscal years and the current fiscal year to date:   
   
    Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of
the calendar year. Future distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board. We expect that our distributions to stockholders will generally be from accumulated net investment income, from net realized capital gains or non-taxable return of
capital, if any, as applicable.   
         51   

Table of Contents  

   We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC
status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we
currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ( i.e. , net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future
decide to retain such capital gains for investment.      We maintain an  opt out  dividend reinvestment plan for our
common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders  cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically  opt out  of the dividend
reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions.      We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to
make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in the future be limited in our ability
to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax
consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such
as contractual payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or
without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company.   
  With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing and certain other upfront fees
associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders.       Related
Parties       We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the
following:       

We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with Solar Capital Partners. Mr. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, is a managing member
and a senior investment professional of, and has financial and controlling interests in, the Investment Adviser. In addition, Mr. Spohler, our chief operating officer is a partner and a senior investment professional of, and has financial
interests in, the Investment Adviser.          

The Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our
Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with
performing compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief compliance officer, our chief financial officer and any administrative support staff.      

We have entered into a license agreement with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser has granted us a non-exclusive,
royalty-free license to use the name  Solar Capital.          The Investment Adviser and its affiliates
may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, the Investment Adviser presently serves as investment adviser to Solar Capital Ltd., a publicly traded BDC,
which to focuses on investing primarily in senior secured loans, mezzanine loans and equity securities. In addition, Michael S. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, Bruce Spohler, our chief operating officer, and Richard L. Peteka, our
  
         52   

Table of Contents  

chief financial officer, serve in similar capacities for Solar Capital Ltd. The Investment Adviser and certain investment advisory affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for
us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more
other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser s allocation procedures.   
  Related party transactions may occur between Solar Senior Capital Ltd. and Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC, between Solar Senior Capital
Ltd. and First Lien Loan Program LLC and between Solar Senior Capital Ltd. and FLLP 2015-1, LLC. These transactions may occur in the normal course of business. No administrative fees are paid to Solar Capital Partners by either Gemino
Healthcare Finance, LLC or First Lien Loan Program LLC.      In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the
conduct of our officers and directors. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law.   

Item 3.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, most of the investments in our portfolio had floating interest rates. Our
loans are primarily based on floating LIBOR and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Most of our loans to portfolio companies have LIBOR floors. The Company also has a revolving
credit facility that is based on floating LIBOR and commercial paper rates. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one-quarter of one percent decrease in LIBOR on
our floating rate assets and liabilities would not change our net investment income per average share over the next twelve months. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a
hypothetical one percent increase in LIBOR on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our earnings by approximately four cents per average share over the next twelve months. However, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations
from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also
limit our ability to participate in any benefits of certain changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments.       

Item 4.   
   Controls and Procedures           (a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        As of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period covered by this
report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that
evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our
periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and
procedures.

     (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting     
  Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third
quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

      PART II. OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.   
   Legal Proceedings         We,
Solar Capital Management, LLC and Solar Capital Partners, LLC are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal
course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a
material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations beyond what has been disclosed with these financial statements.       

Item 1A.   
   Risk Factors         In addition

financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Registration Statement on Form N-2 are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be
immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:      a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
period in which this report is being prepared;      b) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles;      c) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and
procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   
  d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over
financial reporting; and      5. The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   
  a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
