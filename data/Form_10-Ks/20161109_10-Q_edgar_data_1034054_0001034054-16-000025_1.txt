SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

CONDENSED   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED     FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS   (UNAUDITED) 

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   for SBA Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company ). These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, omit or condense certain footnotes and other information normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair financial statement presentation have been made. The results of operations for an interim period may not give a true indication of the results for the year. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.  

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. While the Company believes that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, the actual amounts, when known, may vary from these estimates.  

Foreign Currency Translation   

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the U.S. dollar as its functional currency are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Unrealized remeasurement gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Shareholders  Deficit.  

The functional currency for the Company s Central American subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries which are not denominated in U.S. dollars are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are remeasured at monthly average rates prevailing during the year. Unrealized translation gains and losses are reported as   other   income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

Intercompany Loans  

In accordance with ASC 830, the Company remeasures foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in   other   income (expense), ne  t in the Consolidated Statement   of Operations   as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future  . The Company recorded a   $3.2   million   loss   and a   $112.1   million   loss   on the remeasurement of intercompany loans for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and a  n     $89.0   million gain and a   $180.4   million loss on the remeasurement of intercompany loans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  

On July 11, 2016,   a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company   repaid   $22.5   million of the outstanding balance on the intercompany loan   with Brazil Shareholder I, LLC, leaving a current outstanding balance of   $433.3   million. 

Bad Debt Provision 

On June 20, 2016, Oi, S.A. ( Oi ), the Company s largest customer in Brazil, filed a petition for judicial reorganization in Brazil. Prior to the filing of the reorganization petition, Oi was current in all payment obligations to the Company. These obligations related to periods ending on or before April 30, 2016. As a result of the relief provisions available in a judicial reorganization proceeding, obligations of Oi to the Company arising from the periods from May 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 remain unpaid. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of amounts owed by Oi relating to services provided prior to the date of Oi s petition, the Company has recorded a   $16.5   million bad debt provision (the  Oi reserve ) which covers amounts owed or potentially owed by Oi as of the filing date. Under Brazilian law governing judicial reorganizations, the contracts governing post-petition obligations such as tower rents remain unchanged, and debtors do not have the ability to reject or terminate the contracts other than pursuant to their original terms. Since the filing, the Company has received all payments due in connection with obligations of Oi accruing post-petition. The Oi reserve has been recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted 

In April 2015, the     Financial Acco  unting Standards Board ("FASB")   issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest. The standard requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016 and reclassified   $90.2   million from deferred financing fees, net to long-term debt in the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest - Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. The standard indicates the S  ecurities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission )   staff would not object to presenting debt issuance costs for a line of credit arrangement as an asset in the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2015-15 effective January 1, 2016 and has elected to continue to present debt issuance costs for its Revolving Credit Facility as an asset on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations. The standard requires that the acquirer (1) recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, (2) record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, and (3) to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The Company adopted ASU 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016. The financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for all periods presented. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which the Company adopted as of January 1, 2016. The standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for shared-based payment transactions including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification of awards as either equity or a liability, and classification on the   Consolidated S  tatement of   C  ash   F  lows. The financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for all periods presented.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to decrease the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The standard requires that (1) cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, (2) contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination be classified as cash outflows for investing activities, (3) contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination be separated with cash payments up to the amount of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date be classified as financing activities and any excess be classified as operating activities. The standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 effective January 1, 2016. The financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for all periods presented. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the FASB released an updated standard regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, exclusive of those contracts within lease accounting. The new standard is effective for   the Company in the first quarter of 2018.   Early adoption is permitted but not   before the first quarter of 2017  . This standard is required to be applied (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) with the cumulative effect being recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is evaluating the standard and does not expect a material financial statement impact upon adoption. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. ASU 2016-02 is effective for   the Company in the first quarter of 2019. E  arly adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the standard including the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

2.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    The Company s earnout liabilities related to acquisitions are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs and are recorded in Accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in estimate are recorded in Acquisition related adjustments and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company determines the fair value of acquisition-related earnouts (contingent consideration) and any subsequent changes in fair value using a discounted probability-weighted approach using Level 3 inputs. Level 3 valuations rely on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The fair value of the earnouts is reviewed quarterly and is based on the payments the Company expects to make based on historical internal observations related to the anticipated performance of the underlying assets. The Company s estimate of the fair value of its obligation contained in various acquisitions was   $3.8   million and   $7.2   million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   The maximum potential obligation related to the performance targets was   $5.4   million   and   $10.2   million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

The follow  ing summarizes the activity of   accrued earnouts: 

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis    The Company s long-lived assets, intangibles, and asset retirement obligations are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. The Company considers many factors and makes certain assumptions when making this assessment, including but not limited to: general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential and expected timing of lease-up. The fair value of the long-lived assets, intangibles, and asset retirement obligations is calculated using a discounted cash flow model.  

The following summarizes the activity of asset impairment and decommission costs: 

(1) 

Represents   additional impairment charges resulting from the Company s analysis that the future cash flows would not recover the carrying value of the investment resulting from increased lease terminations  .     

(2) 

Related to the sale of fiber assets acquired in the 2012 Mobilitie transaction which were impaired during the third quarter of 2015.        

Fair Value of Financial Instruments    The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash,   accounts payable, and short-term investments approximate their estimated fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. Short-term investments consisted   of   $0.5   million in certificate of deposits as of   December 31, 2015  , and   $0.2   million in Treasury securities   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company s estimate of the fair value of its held-to-maturity  

9   

Table of Contents  

investments in treasury and corporate bonds, including current portion, are based primarily upon Level 1 reported market values. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value and   fair value   of the held-to-maturity investments, including current portion, were   $0.9   million.   As of   December 31, 2015  ,    the carrying   value and fair value of the held  -to-maturity investments, including current portion,   were   $0.8   million and   $0.9   million  , respectively.   These amounts are recorded in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company determines fair value of its debt instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted prices and indicative quotes (non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to approximate the carrying value because the interest payments are based on Eurodollar rates that reset every month. The Company does not believe its credit risk has changed materially from the date the applicable Eurodollar Rate plus   137.5   to   200.0   basis points was set for the Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to Note 10 for the fair values, principal balances, and carrying values of the Company s debt instruments.  

3.    RESTRICTED CASH  

Restricted cash consists of the following:  

Pursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities (see Note 10), the Company is required to establish a securitization escrow account, held by   the   indenture trustee, into which all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the Tower Securities are directly deposited by the lessees. These restricted cash amounts are used to fund reserve accounts for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums related to towers, (3) trustee and servicing expenses, and (4) management fees. The restricted cash in the securitization escrow account in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 10) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are in compliance with their debt service coverage ratio and that no event of default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

On September 30, 2016, the Company paid into escrow   $528.1 million   consisting of   $500.0   million of   principal, a   $14.1   million call premium, and   $14.1   million in accrued interest   related to the redemption of the   5.625%   Senior Notes. As of September 30, 2016, these amounts were   recorded as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.     On   October 3, 2016, these funds were released from escrow and the 5.625% Senior Notes obligation was extinguished.  

Payment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the Company. Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily relate  d   to the Company s tower removal obligations. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $39.0   million and   $38.6   million in surety  ,   payment and performance bonds, respectively, for which it was only required to post   $0.5   million   and   $0.7   million   in collateral  , respectively  . The Company periodically evaluates the collateral posted for its bonds to ensure that it meets the minimum requirements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had also pledged   $2.5     million as collateral related   to its workers compensation policy.

The Company recorded these amounts in prepaid rent on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   316   completed towers and related assets and liabilities for   $144.5   million in cash consisting of   $40.1   million of property and equipment,   $104.2   million of intangible assets, and   $0.2   million of working capital adjustments.  

The Company evaluates all acquisitions after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption, as well as the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwi  ll if certain criteria are met  .

13.    INCOME TAXES  

The primary reason for the difference in the Company s effective tax rate and the US statutory rate is a result of the Company having a full valuation allowance on its US net deferred tax assets. The Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized and has recorded a full valuation allowance. A foreign tax provision is recognized because certain international subsidiaries of the Company have profitable operations or are in a net deferred tax liability position. 

On October 3, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized   the Company   to take all necessary steps to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for tax purposes.    The Company   intends to elect to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable   year ending December 31, 2016.     The Company believes that it is operating in a manner that complies with the REIT rules as of January 1, 2016.   As a REIT, the Company generally will   be entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore   not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax   on that portion of its net income that it distributes to its shareholders  .    As a REIT,   the Company   will continue to pay U.S. federal income tax on earnings, if any, from assets and operations held through   its   taxable REIT   subsidiaries (     TRSs   )  .    These assets and operations currently consist primarily of the Company s site development services and its international operations. The Company s international operations would continue to be subject, as applicable, to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are located. The Company may also be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local and foreign income, property and other taxes on its assets and operations.   The Company     s determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number of factors, including REIT distribution requirements,   its existing federal net operating losses (     NOLs     ) of approximately   $1.  2   billion as of December 31, 2015  , the Company s financial condition  ,   earnings, debt covenants, and other possible uses of such funds  .  The   Company   may use these NOLs to offset its REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.    The Company   does not expect that it will be required to make any distribution of accumulated earnings and profits (commonly referred to as a      purging      dividend) in connection with its REIT conversion. 

14.    SEGMENT DATA 

The Company operates   principally   in   two   business segments  :   site leasing and site development  .     The Company s site leasing business includes two   reportable segments  ,   domestic site leasing   and   international site leasing.   The Company s   business   segments   are strategic business units   that offer different services  .     They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The     site leasing segment include  s   results of the managed and sublease businesses. The site development segment includes the results of both consulting and construction related activities.   The Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker utilizes segment operating profit and operating income as his two measures of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level.

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share was calculated by dividing net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and any dilutive Common Stock equivalents, including unvested restricted stock and shares issuable upon exercise of stock options as determined under the  If-Converted  method and also Common Stock warrants as determined under the  Treasury Stock  method.

For the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  , the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding   excluded an   additional     2.2   million   shares issuable upon exercise of the Company s stock options because the impact would be anti-dilutive. 

For the   three and nine months ended September   30, 2015, all potential common stock equivalents, including     3.9   million   shares     of stock options outstanding and     0.3   million shares   of restricted stock   units   outstanding, were excluded as the   effect would be anti-dilutive.

As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   25,878   towers  , a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately   5,500   actual or potential   tower  s, approximately   500   of which were revenue producing as of   September 30, 2016  . Our other business line   is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.  

Site Leasing Services  

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America, and   South America  .    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   15,845   towers in the United States and its territories and     10,033   towers in our international markets.   Approximately 27% of our total towers are located in Brazil   and less than 3% of our total towers are located in   each of our other international market  s  .    We receive   s  ite leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless,   Claro, Digicel,   Oi   S.A.  ,    and   Telefonica.   Wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual   site  . In the United States and Canada, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in our Central American and   South American   markets typically have an initial term of   ten   years with   multiple five year   renewal   periods. In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in South America escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

In our Central American     markets     and Ecuador  , significantly all of our revenue,     expenses,   and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are   denominated in U.S. dollars.   Specifically, most of our ground leases, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are   due and paid in U.S. dollars.   In our Central American markets, our local currency   obligations   are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities,   and   (3) taxes. In our   Brazilian  , Canadian, and Chilean     operations, significantly all of our     revenue  ,   expenses  , and capital expenditures,   including tenant leases, ground leases, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. 

Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:  

Rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;      

Straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests;      

Property taxes;      

Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);      

Utilities;      

Property insurance; and      

Deferred lease origination cost amortization.      

For any given tower, each of the above costs is relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, cost of site leasing revenue for owned towers does not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing. 

Ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five  -  year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually, or in   our South American markets,   adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index.   As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   73%   of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years.  

As indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 of our Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.  

We believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers   increase their use of our towers   due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements.   In the current environment, we expect that this activity will primarily be in the form of amendments to current leases as wireless service providers seek to upgrade their antennas  ,   and in the long-term, new leases as these providers continue to expand and upgrade their networks.    We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows   on existing towers   by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers   add or   upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue   other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of service (e.g. iD  EN  )  .

Site Development Services  

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others   on a local basis, through regional, territory, and project offices. The regional offices are responsible for all site development operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area  .   

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes listed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K as critical to our business operations and the understanding   of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other   accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.  

Proposed REIT Conversion 

On October 3, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized us to take all necessary steps to be subject to tax as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We believe that our business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, and as a result, we intend to make the election to be subject to tax as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016.  Because we believe our business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, no further reorganization of our operations is necessary to complete the REIT conversion. 

A REIT is a corporation that qualifies for special treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes because, among other things, it derives most of its income from real estate-based sources and makes a special election under the Code.  We intend to operate as a REIT that principally invests in, and derives most of its income from the ownership, operation and leasing of, towers.  As a REIT, we generally will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that we distribute to our shareholders.  As a REIT, we will continue to pay U.S. federal income tax on earnings, if any, from assets and operations held through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). These assets and operations currently consist primarily of our site development services and our international operations. Our international operations would continue to be subject, as applicable, to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are located. We may also be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local and foreign income, property and other taxes on our assets and operations.  Our determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number of factors, including REIT distribution requirements, our existing federal net operating losses ( NOLs ) of approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, our financial condition, earnings, debt covenants, and other possible uses of such funds.  We may use these NOLs to offset our REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.  We do not expect that we will be required to make any distribution of accumulated earnings and profits (commonly referred to as a "purging" dividend) in connection with   our   REIT conversion. 

In connection with this election, we propose to merge with and into SBA Communications REIT Corporation ( SBA REIT ), a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SBA   Communications Corporation ( SBAC )  , which was specifically formed for the purpose of the merger.  Effective at the time of the merger, SBA REIT will be renamed  SBA Communications Corporation  and will hold, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, the assets currently held by SBA  C   and will conduct the existing businesses of SBA  C   and its subsidiaries.  Although the REIT rules do not require the completion of this merger, we intend to complete the merger

to facilitate our compliance with the REIT rules by ensuring the effective adoption of certain REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions related to our capital stock, subject to approval by our shareholders.  On October 3, 2016, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission   (the  Commission )   a preliminary proxy statement which provides information regarding the REIT conversion, the proposed merger and the special meeting, at which shareholders will be given the opportunity to vote on the merger.  

See Note 13 of our Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report and  Item 1A Risk Factors  for additional information concerning the proposed REIT conversion. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

This report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

This report contains information regarding a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA. We have provided below a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure.   This report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange   rates and the Oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period. We believe that excluding the Oi reserve, which represents a   $16.5   million one-time bad debt provision for all amounts owed or potentially owed by Oi prior to the date of Oi s June 2016 petition for judicial

reorganization, provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a non-recurring event. 

Adjusted EBITDA  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net   (  loss  ) income   excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization,   and   provision for or benefit from taxes.  

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2014 Senior Notes   and 2016 Senior Notes   (defined below)  . Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

Interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.      

Adjusted   EBITDA   increase  d    $8.0   million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior year period. On a constant   currency basis, adjusted EBITDA     increase  d    $5.4   million. The   increase  s were primarily due to increases in domestic and international site leasing segment operating profit, partially offset by   an   increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and a decrease in site development segment operating profit. 

Adjusted EBITDA net of the Oi reserve   increase  d    $15.5   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA net of the Oi reserve   increase  d    $27.8   million. The   increase  s were primarily due to increases in domestic and international site leasing segment operating profit, partially offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and a decrease in site development segment operating profit  . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

SBA  C   is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBAC s only significant asset is 100% of the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC ( Telecommunications ), which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and assets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications  subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings,   is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.

A summary of our cash flows is as   follows:  

Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating   activities was   $514.2   million for the   nine     months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $534.7   million for the   nine     months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The     decrease     of   $20.6   million   was primarily due to increases in cash outflows associated with working capital changes,   decreased site development segment operating profit,   increased selling, general, and administrative expenses  ,   increased cash interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding   and the payment of accrued interest associated with the redemption of the 5.625% Senior Notes  , and the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by   an increase in segment operating profit from domestic site leasing   and   international site leasing     operating segments  . 

Investing Activities 

A detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows: 

During all of   2016  , inclusive of the capital expenditures made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we expect to incur non-discretionary   cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of   $32.6   million to   $33.6   million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current acquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of   $346.1   million to   $356.1   million as well as potential, additional tower acquisitions not yet under contract. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact   amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  ,   including amounts necessary to support our   tower   portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.

Debt Service  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility, our cash flows from operations for the next twelve months, and future financings   will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months.  

The following table illustrates our estimate of our debt service requirement over the next twelve months based on the amounts outstanding   as of   September 30, 2016   and the   interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in thousands):

ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE   AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.  

The following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term   indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016  :    

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2013-1C Tower Securities is April 10, 2018 and April 9, 2043, respectively. 

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2013-2C Tower Securities is April 11, 2023 and April 9, 2048, respectively. 

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2013-1D Tower Securities   are   April 10, 2018 and April 9, 2043, respectively. 

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2014-1C Tower Securities is October 8, 2019 and October 11, 2044, respectively.  

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2014-2C Tower Securities is October 8, 2024 and October 8, 2049, respectively. 

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2015-1C Tower Securities is October 8, 2020 and October 10, 2045, respectively.    

The anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2016-1C Tower Securities is July 9, 2021 and July 10, 2046, respectively.    

Our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to (1) our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates, if at all, and (2  )   the impact of interest rate movements on our 2014 Term Loan and 2015 Term Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.  

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil  ,    Ca  nada  , and Chile  ,    and to a lesser extent, our markets in Central America. In each of these markets  , we pay most of our selling, general, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in Brazil  ,   Canada  , and Chile  , we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our  

41   

Table of Contents  

operating expenses in local currency. All transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).     For   the   nine     months   ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately     11.4%   of our revenues and approximately     15.0%     of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. 

We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the Brazilian Rea  l   from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating   income   to fluctuate by   approximately   1.0%   and   2.8%  , respectively, for   the   nine     months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we     ha  d intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our   determination of net income. A   change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt   at   September 30, 2016     would   have   result  ed   in   approximately   $43.4   million   of unrealized gains or losses that would   have   be  en   included in   other     income (  expense  ), net   in our C  onsolidated   S  tatement of   O  perations for the     nine     months   ended   September 30, 2016  .

PART II       OTHER   INFORMATION 

ITEM   1A  .    RISK FACTORS 

Complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities.  

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the nature and diversification of our assets, the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders. For example, to qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and  real estate assets  (as defined in the Code), including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017) or 20% (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets.  

In addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify and be subject to tax as a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income after the utilization of any available NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our shareholders. Our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors, including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing NOLs. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (after the application of available NOLs, if any), we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code. These distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities. Furthermore, our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need, or require, the target company to comply with certain REIT requirements. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income, amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness.  

Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, to the extent we have REIT taxable income and have utilized our NOLs, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.  

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.  

Our   B  oard of   D  irectors has authorized us to take all necessary steps for SBA  C   to be subject to tax as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. We received an opinion of our special REIT tax counsel with respect to our qualification as a REIT. Investors should be aware, however, that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or any court. The opinion represents only the view of such counsel based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us, including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income. The opinion is expressed as of the date issued. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.  

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, to the extent we have REIT taxable income and have utilized our NOLs, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which  

44   

Table of Contents  

we failed to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced.  

We may be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or raise equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.  

From time to time, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings, to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage, decrease our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases.  

Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage. Furthermore, compliance with the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our total leverage.  

Covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required REIT distributions.  

The Senior Credit Agreement, the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2014 Senior Notes and 2016 Senior Notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Under the Senior Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100% of our REIT taxable income, so long as SBA Senior Finance II s ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA does not exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter. In addition, under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions, or Securitization, a failure to comply with the Debt Service Coverage Ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us. Finally, while the indentures governing the 2014 Senior Notes and the 2016 Senior Notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a REIT or to avoid entity level taxation, this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2014 Senior Notes or the 2016 Senior Notes, as applicable, have not otherwise been accelerated.  

If these limits prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax, and potentially the nondeductible 4% excise tax, on the retained amounts.  

Our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.  

REITs are required to distribute annually at least 90% of their REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain). We estimate that we had approximately $1.2 billion in NOLs as of December 31, 2015. We may, at our discretion, use these NOLs to offset our REIT taxable income, and thus the required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as our NOLs have been fully utilized. We currently expect that we will utilize available NOLs to reduce all or a portion of our REIT taxable income and therefore we may not initially make any distributions, which may adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.  

The amount of future distributions will be determi  ned, from time to time, by the B  oard of   D  irectors to balance our goal of increasing long-term shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy, which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, and then stock repurchases, when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value. The actual timing and amount of distributions will be as   determined and declared by the B  oard of   D  irectors and will depend on, among other factors, our NOLs, our financial condition, earnings, debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds. Consequently, our future distribution levels may fluctuate.

Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which would reduce our cash flows, and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.  

We may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. In addition, we may incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm s length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.  

Our TRS assets and operations also will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. We will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 35%) on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring during our first five years as a REIT, up to the amount of the built-in gain that existed on January 1, 2016, which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis in those assets as of January 1, 2016. Gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax. We currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. We cannot, however, assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard.  

Our use of TRSs may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.  

The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and such undistributed TRS income is generally not subject to our REIT distribution requirements. However, if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities, taken together with other non-qualifying assets, to represent more than 25% of the fair market value of our assets, or causes the fair market value of our TRS securities alone to represent more than 25% (for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017) or 20% (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets, in each case, as determined for REIT asset testing purposes, we would, absent timely responsive action, fail to qualify as a REIT.  

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.  

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect our investors or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. New legislation, U.S. Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification.  

We do not have any experience operating as a REIT, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations.  

While we believe that we are currently operating in a manner that complies with the REIT rules, we have not actually operated as a REIT previously. Our pre-REIT operating experience may not be sufficient to enable us to operate successfully as a REIT. In addition, we will be required to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a REIT. As a result, we may incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not previously incurred, which could be significant, and our management and other personnel may need to devote additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the Code. These costs and time commitments could be substantially more than we currently expect. Therefore, our historical combined consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future costs and performance as a REIT. If our performance is adversely affected, it could affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.  

The current market price of our Class A common stock may not be indicative of the market price of our Class A common stock following the REIT conversion.  

The current market price of our Class A common stock may not be indicative of how the market will value our Class A common stock following the REIT conversion because of the change in our organization from a taxable C corporation to a REIT. Although we do not currently anticipate commencing distributions until a future date, the stock price of REIT securities have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates as investors evaluate the annual yield from distributions on the entity s common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments. In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock in the future may be affected by general market conditions (as the price of the our Class A common stock currently is) and will be potentially affected by the economic and market perception of REIT securities.

As a REIT, we will no longer be eligible to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index; therefore, those index funds that invest in the equity of NASDAQ 100 companies will be required to sell our shares and not purchase them in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the volatility and market price of our Class A common stock. 

As of the date of this filing, SBA  C   is included in the NASDAQ 100 Index.  On October 3, 2016, our Board of Directors   authorized us   to take all necessary steps to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending   on   December 31, 2016.  One of the eligibility criteria for the NASDAQ 100 Index is that the company is not a financial company.  As a REIT, we would be considered a financial company, even though our business model will not change in connection with the REIT conversion, and therefore we will no longer be eligible to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index.  As a result, those index funds that invest in NASDAQ 100 companies will be required to sell shares of our Class A common stock and not purchase them in the future.  In addition, other non-index funds that use inclusion on the NASDAQ 100 Index as a component of their investment criteria may be required to sell and no longer be able to invest in our Class A common stock.  We do not know how many shares of our Class A common stock are held by these index and non-index funds.  The sales of significant amounts of shares of our Class A common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur could have an adverse effect on the volatility and market price of our Class A common stock. 

Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.  

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from  qualified dividends  payable to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition.  

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. Consequently, a reduction in demand for site leasing, reduced future capital expenditures on the networks, or the complete loss, as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise, of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth.  

On June 20, 2016, Oi, S.A. ( Oi ), our largest customer in Brazil, filed a petition for judicial reorganization in Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Oi comprised approximately 8% of our total site leasing revenue and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Oi comprised approximately 7% of our total site leasing revenue. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of amounts owed by Oi prior to the date of Oi s petition, we recorded a $16.5 million bad debt provision during the second quarter of 2016 relating to amounts owed or potentially owed by Oi as of the filing date. While we continue to do business with Oi under our contracts with it in the ordinary course and Oi has stated its intentions to continue normal operations during its judicial reorganization, we cannot assure you that Oi will continue to be willing or able to continue to make payments to us in accordance with the terms of our contracts. Judicial reorganization in Brazil requires the agreement of certain creditors, for which there can be no assurance. If Oi is unable to successfully reorganize, it may be forced to liquidate. If Oi is unable or unwilling to reorganize in a manner that continues to provide us anticipated payments in accordance with our contracts, it could materially decrease our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition. 

The following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers:    

47   

Table of Contents  

We also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments:    

(1) 

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of AT T Wireless and Leap Wireless (Cricket Wireless).     

(2) 

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of T-Mobile and Metro PCS.     

(3) 

Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of Sprint and Clearwire.     

We derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts. Each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the U.S. and Canada, and renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. Site leasing contracts in our Central American and South American markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods. However, if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.  

Our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. In addition, a customer s need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. Furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects.

ITEM 2.     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  

The following table presents information related to our repurchases of Class A common stock during the   third quarter   of   2016 

(1) 

On June 4, 2015, we announced a new $1.0 billion stock repurchase plan.  This plan authorizes us to purchase from time to time our outstanding common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and/or in privately negotiated transactions at management s discretion. Shares purchased will be retired. This plan has no time deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by our Board   of Directors   at any time in our sole discretion.
