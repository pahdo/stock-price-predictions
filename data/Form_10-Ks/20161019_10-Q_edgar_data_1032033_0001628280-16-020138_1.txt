1. Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation  
  The accompanying unaudited, consolidated financial statements of SLM Corporation ( Sallie Mae,   SLM,  the  Company,   we,  or  us ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SLM Corporation and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries after eliminating the effects of intercompany accounts and transactions. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other period. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Form 10-K ). 
    
  Correction Recorded in the Current Period 
  We recognized in the current period adjustments for tax positions relating to historical transactions among entities that are now subsidiaries of Navient Corporation ( Navient ) that should have been recorded at the time of the separation of Navient from SLM (the  Spin-Off ), which occurred on April 30, 2014. We have evaluated the quantitative and qualitative materiality of these errors to all of the relevant periods and concluded that the out of period correction to recognize the asset, liabilities and income statement impacts in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 is not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the relevant periods. The adjustments increased our tax indemnification receivable and income taxes payable by $  120   million and increased our other income and income tax expense by $  9   million, as we believe we are indemnified by Navient for these additional tax liabilities. Accordingly, there was no effect on equity or net income as a result of these errors in the current or prior periods. Prospectively, these uncertain tax position liabilities and related assets will be accounted for consistent with our existing accounting policies for these kinds of assets and liabilities. 
  Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries after eliminating the effects of intercompany accounts and transactions.  
  We consolidate any variable interest entity ( VIE ) where we have determined we are the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary is the entity which has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.   
  Loan Interest Income 
  For loans classified as  held for investment,  we recognize interest income as earned, adjusted for the amortization of deferred direct origination costs. This adjustment is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan over its life after giving effect to prepayments and extensions. We consider our constant prepayment rate ( CPR ) estimates a significant accounting assumption used to measure the expected prepayment activity in our education loan portfolio. The estimates are based on a number of factors such as historical prepayment rates for loans with similar loan characteristics, assumptions about portfolio composition and loan terms, and the prepayment curve s tendency to follow a ramp pattern (i.e., the prepayment rate typically increases during the in-school and early repayment periods, then stabilizes). The CPR measures the expected prepayment activity over the life of the loan and is applied as a flat-rate input assumption when used in forecasting.

  (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
                   1. 
    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Our CPR estimates include the effect of voluntary prepayments, education loan defaults, and consolidation (if the loans are consolidated to third parties), all of which shorten the lives of loans. CPR estimates also consider the utilization of deferment, forbearance, and extended repayment plans, which lengthen the lives of loans. We regularly evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the CPRs. In instances where there are changes to the assumptions, amortization of deferred direct origination costs is adjusted on a cumulative basis to reflect the change since the origination of the loan. We also pay to the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ) an annual 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee on FFELP consolidation loans, which is netted against loan interest income. Additionally, interest earned on education loans reflects potential non-payment adjustments in accordance with our uncollectible interest recognition policy. We do not amortize any adjustments to the basis of education loans when they are classified as  held-for-sale.  
  We recognize certain fee income (primarily late fees) on education loans when earned according to the contractual provisions of the promissory notes, as well as our expectation of collectibility. Fee income is recorded when earned in  other non-interest income  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
  Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
  On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases,  a comprehensive new lease standard which will supersede previous lease guidance. The standard requires a lessee to recognize in its balance sheet assets and liabilities related to long-term leases that were classified as operating leases under previous guidance. An asset will be recognized related to the right to use the underlying asset and a liability will be recognized related to the obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding leases. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends the current stock compensation guidance. The amendments simplify the accounting for the taxes related to stock-based compensation, including adjustments to how excess tax benefits and a company s payments for tax withholdings should be classified. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, and at this time we expect the standard to result in immaterial volatility in earnings caused by the change in the treatment of the tax benefits or deficiencies related to share-based payments at settlement (or expiration) through  income tax expense  in our consolidated statements of income.  
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held.  Under this standard, we will be required to hold an allowance equal to the expected life-of-loan losses on our loan portfolio.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and capital ratios.

2. Loans Held for Investment 
  Loans held for investment consist of Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans. We use  Private Education Loans  to mean education loans to students or their families that are not made, insured or guaranteed by any state or federal government. Private Education Loans do not include loans insured or guaranteed under the previously existing Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ).  
  Our Private Education Loans are made largely to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount funded through financial aid, government loans and customers  resources. Private Education Loans bear the full credit risk of the customer. We manage this risk through risk-performance underwriting strategies and qualified cosigners. Private Education Loans generally carry a variable rate indexed to LIBOR. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   81   percent of all of our Private Education Loans were indexed to LIBOR. We provide incentives for customers to include a cosigner on the loan, and the vast majority of loans in our portfolio are cosigned. We also provide total cost incentives for customers to make payments while in school. 
  FFELP Loans are insured as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default subject to a Risk Sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. These insurance obligations are supported by contractual rights against the United States. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive   97 percent   reimbursement on all qualifying claims. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993, and before July 1, 2006, we receive   98 percent   reimbursement on all qualifying claims. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive   100   percent reimbursement on all qualifying claims. 
  Loans held for investment are summarized as follows: 

The estimated weighted average life of education loans in our portfolio was approximately   6.0   years and   6.2   years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

3.  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  Our provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb incurred probable losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolios. The evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. We believe the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses incurred in the loan portfolios.

Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs )  
  All of our loans are collectively assessed for impairment, except for loans classified as TDRs (where we conduct individual assessments of impairment). We modify the terms of loans for certain borrowers when we believe such modifications may increase the ability and willingness of a borrower to make payments and thus increase the ultimate overall amount collected on a loan. These modifications generally take the form of a forbearance, a temporary interest rate reduction or an extended repayment plan. The majority of our loans that are considered TDRs involve a temporary forbearance of payments and do not change the contractual interest rate of the loan.  Approximately   25 percent   and   23 percent   of the loans granted forbearance as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, have been classified as TDRs due to their forbearance status. For additional information, see Note 6,  Allowance for Loan Losses  in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Within the Private Education Loan portfolio, loans greater than   90 days   past due are considered to be nonperforming. FFELP Loans are at least   97 percent   guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest by the federal government in the event of default and, therefore, we do not deem FFELP Loans as nonperforming from a credit risk perspective at any point in their life cycle prior to claim payment, and continue to accrue interest on those loans through the date of claim.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all of our TDR loans had a related allowance recorded. The following table provides the recorded investment, unpaid principal balance and related allowance for our TDR loans.

4. Deposits  
    
  The following table summarizes total deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Interest Bearing 
  Interest bearing deposits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of retail non-maturity savings deposits, retail and brokered non-maturity money market deposits ( MMDAs ) and brokered and retail certificates of deposit ( CDs ). Included in these accounts are what we consider to be core deposits from various sources. Our deposit products are serviced by third-party providers. Placement fees associated with the brokered CDs are amortized into interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We recognized placement fee expense of $  2.6   million and $  2.7   million in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and placement fee expense of   $7.8   million and $  8.0   million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Fees paid to third-party brokers related to brokered CDs were $  1.1   million and   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $4.0   million and   $0.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

5.  Borrowings 
    
  Outstanding borrowings consist of secured borrowings issued through our term asset-backed securitization ( ABS ) program and our asset-backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) funding facility (the  ABCP Facility ). The following table summarizes our secured borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  

Short-term Borrowings       
  Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
  On December 19, 2014, we closed on a $  750.0   million ABCP Facility. We retained a   5 percent   or $  37.5   million participation interest in the ABCP Facility, resulting in $  712.5 million   of funds available for us to draw under the ABCP Facility. During 2015, we incurred financing costs under the ABCP Facility of approximately   0.40 percent   on average on unused borrowing capacity and approximately 3-month LIBOR plus   0.80 percent   on outstandings under the ABCP Facility.  
  On February 25, 2016, we amended and extended the maturity of our ABCP Facility. The amended ABCP Facility is a $  750.0 million   ABCP Facility, in which we no longer hold a participation interest. As a result, the full $  750.0 million   is available for us to draw. We hold   100 percent   of the residual interest in the ABCP Facility trust. Under the amended ABCP Facility, we incur financing costs of between   0.35 percent   and   0.45 percent   on unused borrowing capacity and approximately 3 month LIBOR plus   1.00 percent   on outstandings. The amended ABCP Facility extends the revolving period, during which we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds, until February 23, 2017. The scheduled amortization period, during which amounts outstanding under the ABCP Facility must be repaid, ends on February 23, 2018 (or earlier, if certain material adverse events occur). At   September 30, 2016  , $  350   million was outstanding under the ABCP Facility. At September 30, 2016, $  428.7   million of our Private Education Loans were encumbered to support outstandings under the ABCP Facility.  
  Short-term borrowings have a remaining term to maturity of one year or less. The ABCP Facility s contractual maturity is   two years   from the date of inception or renewal (  one   year revolving period plus a   one   year amortization period); however, we classify advances under our ABCP Facility as short-term borrowings because it is our intention to repay those advances within one year.

Long-term Borrowings       
    
  On May 26, 2016, we executed our $  551   million SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2016-A term ABS transaction, which was accounted for as an on-balance sheet secured financing. We retained a   100   percent or $  50 million   interest in the Class B notes and   100   percent of the residual certificates issued in the securitization.   $501 million   of Class A notes from the securitization were sold to third parties, raising $  501 million   of gross proceeds. The Class A notes had a weighted average life of   4.01   years and priced at a weighted average LIBOR equivalent cost of 1-month LIBOR plus   1.38 percent  . At   September 30, 2016  , $  571 million   of our Private Education Loans were encumbered as a result of this transaction.  
  On July 21, 2016, we executed our $  657   million SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2016-B term ABS transaction, which was accounted for as an on-balance sheet secured financing. We retained a   100 percent   or $  50 million   interest in the Class B notes and   100 percent   of the residual certificates issued in the securitization. $  607 million   of Class A notes from the securitization were sold to third parties, raising $  607 million   of gross proceeds. The Class A notes had a weighted average life of   4.01   years and priced at a weighted average LIBOR equivalent cost of 1-month LIBOR plus   1.36 percent  . At   September 30, 2016  , $  692 million   of our Private Education Loans were encumbered as a result of this transaction.

    We consolidate our financing entities that are VIEs as a result of our being the entities  primary beneficiary. As a result, these financing VIEs are accounted for as secured borrowings. We consolidate the following financing VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively:

  Other Borrowing Sources 
  We maintain discretionary uncommitted Federal Funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, which totaled   $100   million at   September 30, 2016  . The interest rate we are charged on these lines of credit is priced at Fed Funds plus a spread at the time of borrowing, and is payable daily. We did not utilize these lines of credit in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and in the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  We established an account at the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) to meet eligibility requirements for access to the Primary Credit borrowing facility at the FRB s Discount Window (the  Window ). The Primary Credit borrowing facility is a lending program available to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. All borrowings at the Window must be fully collateralized.  We can pledge to the FRB asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, as well as FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans, as collateral for borrowings at the Window. Generally, collateral value is assigned based on the estimated fair value of the pledged assets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the value of our pledged collateral at the FRB totaled   $2.5   billion and   $1.7   billion, respectively. The interest rate charged to us is the discount rate set by the FRB. We did not utilize this facility in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and in the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

6.  Private Education Loan Term Securitizations 
    
  We securitize Private Education Loan assets by selling these assets to securitization trusts. If a transfer of loans qualifies as a sale, we derecognize the loan and recognize a gain or loss as the difference between compensation received and the carrying basis of the loans sold and liabilities retained. We recognize the results of a transfer of loans based upon the settlement date of the transaction. If we have a variable interest in a VIE (e.g., a securitization trust) and have determined that we are the primary beneficiary, then we will consolidate the VIE and the transfer is accounted for as a financing as opposed to a sale.  
  On May 26, 2016, we executed a $  551 million   Private Education Loan Trust term ABS transaction that was accounted for as a secured financing. We retained a   100 percent   or $  50 million   interest in the Class B notes and   100 percent   of the residual certificates issued in the securitization.   $501 million   of Class A notes from the securitization were sold to third parties, raising $  501 million   of gross proceeds.

7.   Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  We maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate changes. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing frequency and underlying index characteristics of certain balance sheet liabilities so any adverse impacts related to movements in interest rates are managed within low to moderate limits. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value or create variability in cash flows. Income or loss on the derivative instruments linked to the hedged item will generally offset the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation or volatility in cash flows for the period the item is being hedged. We view this strategy as a prudent management of interest rate risk. Please refer to Note 11,  Derivative Financial Instruments  in our 2015 Form 10-K for a full discussion of our risk management strategy. 
  Although we use derivatives to reduce the risk of interest rate changes, the use of derivatives does expose us to both market and credit risk. Market risk is the chance of financial loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under a contract and it is limited to the loss of the fair value gain in a derivative that the counterparty owes us less collateral held and plus collateral posted. When the fair value of a derivative contract less collateral held and plus collateral posted is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, we have no credit risk exposure to the counterparty; however, the counterparty has exposure to us. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with highly-rated counterparties that are reviewed regularly by our Credit Department. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement. Depending on the nature of the derivative transaction, bilateral collateral arrangements are required as well. When we have more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the counterparty, and there exists legally enforceable netting provisions with the counterparty (i.e., a legal right to offset receivable and payable derivative contracts), the  net  mark-to-market exposure, less collateral held and plus collateral posted, represents exposure with the counterparty. When there is a net negative exposure, we consider our exposure to the counterparty to be zero. 
  Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires all standardized derivatives, including most interest rate swaps, to be submitted for clearing to central counterparties to reduce counterparty risk. As of   September 30, 2016  , $  5.6   billion notional of our derivative contracts were cleared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Clearing House. All derivative contracts cleared through an exchange require collateral to be exchanged based on the fair value of the derivative. Our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position less any collateral held and plus any collateral posted. When there is a net negative exposure, we consider our exposure to the counterparty to be zero. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had a net positive exposure (derivative gain positions to us, less collateral held by us and plus collateral posted with counterparties) related to derivatives of $  47.6   million and $  50.1   million, respectively.

11. Arrangements with Navient Corporation 
    
  In connection with the separation of Navient from SLM in the Spin-Off, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement (the  Separation and Distribution Agreement ) and other ancillary agreements with Navient. Please refer to Note 16,  Arrangements with Navient Corporation  in our 2015 Form 10-K for a full discussion of these agreements. 
    
  Amended Loan Participation and Purchase Agreement  
   Prior to the Spin-Off, Sallie Mae Bank, a Utah industrial bank subsidiary of the Company (the  Bank ), sold substantially all its Private Education Loans to several former affiliates, now subsidiaries of Navient (collectively, the  Purchasers ), pursuant to a Loan Participation and Purchase Agreement. This agreement predated the Spin-Off, but was significantly amended and reduced in scope in connection with the Spin-Off. Post-Spin-Off, the Bank retains only the right to require the Purchasers to purchase loans (at fair value) for which the borrower also has a separate lending relationship with Navient ( Split Loans ) when the Split Loans either (1) are more than   90 days   past due; (2) have been restructured; (3) have been granted a hardship forbearance or more than   six months   of administrative forbearance; or (4) have a borrower or cosigner who has filed for bankruptcy.  At   September 30, 2016  , we held approximately   $71 million   of Split Loans.  
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank sold loans to the Purchasers in the amount of $  3.6   million in principal and $  0.1   million in accrued interest income. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Bank sold loans to the Purchasers in the amount of $  6.6   million in principal and $  0.2   million in accrued interest income. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank sold loans to the Purchasers in the amount of $  13.1   million in principal and $  0.3   million in accrued interest income. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Bank sold loans to the Purchasers in the amount of $  21.1   million in principal and $  0.4   million in accrued interest income. 
    
  There was   no   gain as a result of the loans sold to the Purchasers in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . Total write-downs to fair value for loans sold with a fair value lower than par totaled   $1.4   million and $  1.9   million in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Total write-downs to fair value for loans sold with a fair value lower than par totaled   $5.0   million and   $5.6   million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Navient is the servicer for all of these loans.

12.  Regulatory Capital  
       
  The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking authorities.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  Under the Basel III capital framework ( U.S. Basel III ) and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital standards that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and its classification under the prompt corrective action framework are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors.    
    
  As of January 1, 2015, the Bank was required to report regulatory capital and ratios in accordance with U.S. Basel III.  Among other things, U.S. Basel III establishes Common Equity Tier 1 as a new tier of capital, modifies methods for calculating risk-weighted assets, introduces a new capital conservation buffer, and revises the capital thresholds of the prompt corrective action framework, including the  well capitalized  standard.  
    
    Well capitalized  regulatory requirements are the quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy.  To qualify as  well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets.  The following capital amounts and ratios are based upon the Bank s assets.  

Bank Dividends 
    
  The Bank is chartered under the laws of the State of Utah and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to the laws of Utah and the regulations of the FDIC. Generally, under Utah s industrial bank laws and regulations as well as FDIC regulations, the Bank may pay dividends from its net profits without regulatory approval if, following the payment of the dividend, the Bank s capital and surplus would not be impaired. The Bank paid   no   dividends for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

13.  Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  
    
  Commitments 
  When we approve a Private Education Loan at the beginning of an academic year, that approval may cover the borrowing for the entire academic year.  As such, we do not always disburse the full amount of the loan at the time of such approval, but instead have a commitment to fund a portion of the loan at a later date (usually at the start of the second semester or subsequent trimesters). At   September 30, 2016  , we had $  1.8   billion of outstanding contractual loan commitments which we expect to fund during the remainder of the 2016/2017 academic year. At   September 30, 2016  , we had a $  1.6 million   reserve recorded in  Other Liabilities  to cover expected losses that we conclude are probable to occur during the   one   year loss emergence period on these unfunded commitments.  
  Regulatory Matters 
  At the time of this filing, the Bank remains subject to a Consent Order, Order to Pay Restitution and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty dated May 13, 2014 issued by the FDIC (the  FDIC Consent Order ) and a Consent Order (the  DOJ Consent Order ) issued by the Department of Justice (the  DOJ ).  On May 13, 2014, the Bank reached a settlement with the DOJ regarding compliance issues with the Servicemembers  Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ). At the same time, the Bank reached a settlement with the FDIC regarding disclosures and assessments of certain late fees, as well as compliance with the SCRA.  Under the FDIC Consent Order, the Bank paid   $3.3 million   in fines and oversaw the refund of up to   $30 million   in late fees, funded by Navient as required by the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, assessed on loans owned or originated by the Bank since its inception in November 2005. The DOJ Consent Order was approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on September 29, 2014. 
  Under the DOJ Consent Order, Navient is solely responsible for reimbursing SCRA benefits and related compensation on behalf of both its subsidiary, Navient Solutions, Inc., and the Bank. 
  We believe the Bank has complied with all the requirements of the FDIC Consent Order and the DOJ Consent Order.  This includes implementing new SCRA policies, procedures and training, updated billing statement disclosures, steps to ensure its third-party service providers are also fully compliant in these regards, and overseeing Navient s restitution responsibilities. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the  CFPB ) of the role of the Bank s primary consumer compliance regulator in January 2015, the FDIC will continue to monitor the Bank s improved compliance management system, policies and procedures until it is satisfied the Bank has demonstrated its ability to sustain the enhancements and additions implemented in response to the FDIC Consent Order. Pursuant to the terms of the DOJ Consent Order, the Bank will remain subject to certain DOJ reporting and record-keeping requirements until September 29, 2018. 
  In May 2014, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) from the CFPB as part of the CFPB s separate investigation relating to customer complaints, fees and charges assessed in connection with the servicing of student loans and related collection practices of pre-Spin-Off SLM Corporation ( pre-Spin-Off SLM ) by entities now subsidiaries of Navient during a time period prior to the Spin-Off.   Two   state attorneys general have provided the Bank identical CIDs and others have become involved in the inquiry over time. To the extent requested, we have been cooperating fully with the CFPB and the attorneys general but are not in a position at this time to predict the duration or outcome of the investigation. Given the timeframe covered by this demand and the focus on practices and procedures previously conducted by Navient and its servicing subsidiaries, Navient is leading the response to this investigation and has accepted responsibility for all costs, expenses, losses or remediation that may arise from this investigation.

    Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued) 

Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings may be based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, employment and other laws. In certain of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damage may be asserted against us and our subsidiaries. 
  It is common for the Company, our subsidiaries and affiliates to receive information and document requests and investigative demands from state attorneys general, legislative committees, and administrative agencies.  These requests may be for informational or regulatory purposes and may relate to our business practices, the industries in which we operate, or other companies with whom we conduct business.  Our practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with these bodies and be responsive to any such requests. 
  We are required to establish reserves for litigation and regulatory matters where those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and estimable, we do not establish reserves. 
  Based on current knowledge, management does not believe there are loss contingencies, if any, arising from pending investigations, litigation or regulatory matters for which reserves should be established. 

14. Subsequent Event  
  On October 12, 2016, we executed our $  674 million   SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2016-C term ABS transaction, which will be accounted for as an on-balance sheet secured financing. We sold $  674 million   of notes to third parties and retained a   100 percent   interest in the residual certificates issued in the securitization, raising approximately $  673 million   of gross proceeds. This transaction will be reflected in our fourth quarter 2016 results.

  This report contains  forward-looking  statements and information based on management s current expectations as of the date of this report. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company s beliefs, opinions or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties set forth in Item 1A  Risk Factors  and elsewhere in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC; increases in financing costs; limits on liquidity; increases in costs associated with compliance with laws and regulations; changes in accounting standards and the impact of related changes in significant accounting estimates; any adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which the Company is a party; credit risk associated with the Company s exposure to third-parties, including counterparties to the Company s derivative transactions; and changes in the terms of education loans and the educational credit marketplace (including changes resulting from new laws and the implementation of existing laws). The Company could also be affected by, among other things: changes in its funding costs and availability; reductions to its credit ratings; failures or breaches of its operating systems or infrastructure, including those of third-party vendors; damage to its reputation; failures to successfully implement cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on the Company s business; risks associated with restructuring initiatives; changes in the demand for educational financing or in financing preferences of lenders, educational institutions, students and their families; changes in law and regulations with respect to the student lending business and financial institutions generally; changes in banking rules and regulations, including increased capital requirements; increased competition from banks and other consumer lenders; the creditworthiness of the Company s customers; changes in the general interest rate environment, including the rate relationships among relevant money-market instruments and those of the Company s earning assets versus the Company s funding arrangements; rates of prepayment on the loans that the Company makes; changes in general economic conditions and the Company s ability to successfully effectuate any acquisitions; and other strategic initiatives. The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect. All forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or changes in its expectations. 
    
  The Company reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain core earnings performance measures. The difference between the Company s  Core Earnings  and GAAP results for the periods presented were the unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivative contracts (excluding current period accruals on the derivative instruments), net of tax. These are recognized in GAAP, but not in  Core Earnings  results. The Company provides  Core Earnings  measures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding the Company s performance and the allocation of corporate resources. The Company s  Core Earnings  are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  For additional information, see  Key Financial Measures  and  GAAP Consolidated Earnings Summary -  Core Earnings    in this Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and  Core Earnings.    
    
  Through this discussion and analysis, we intend to provide the reader with some narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows.

Selected Financial Information and Ratios  

Recent Development 
  On October 12, 2016, we executed our $  674 million   SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2016-C term ABS transaction, which will be accounted for as an on-balance sheet secured financing. We sold $  674 million   of notes to third parties and retained a   100 percent   interest in the residual certificates issued in the securitization, raising approximately $  673 million   of gross proceeds. This transaction will be reflected in our fourth quarter 2016 results. 
  Overview  
  The following discussion and analysis presents a review of our business and operations as of and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Key Financial Measures  
  Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income from our Private Education Loan portfolio, provision expense for credit losses, and operating expenses. The growth of our business and the strength of our financial condition are primarily driven by our ability to achieve our annual Private Education Loan origination goals while sustaining credit quality and maintaining cost-efficient funding sources to support our originations. A brief summary of our key financial measures (net interest income; loan sales and secured financings, net; allowance for loan losses; charge-offs and delinquencies; operating expenses;  Core Earnings;  Private Education Loan originations; and funding sources) can be found in Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
  
    42 

2016 Management Objectives  
  For 2016, we have set out the following major goals for ourselves: (1) prudently grow our Private Education Loan assets and revenues; (2) maintain our strong capital position; (3) enhance our customers  experience by further improving the delivery of our products and services; (4) sustain the consumer protection improvements we have made to our policies, procedures and compliance management system since the Spin-Off and further enhance our risk oversight infrastructure; (5) successfully launch one or more complementary new products to increase the level of engagement we have with our customers; and (6) manage operating expenses while improving efficiency. Here is how we plan to achieve these objectives: 
  Prudently Grow Private Education Loan Assets and Revenues 
  We will continue to pursue managed growth in our Private Education Loan portfolio in 2016 by leveraging our Sallie Mae and Upromise brands and our relationship with more than two thousand colleges and universities. We recently expanded our campus-focused sales force to provide deeper support for universities in all regions of the United States and, as a result, we expect to be able to continue to increase originations through this effort. We are determined to maintain overall credit quality and cosigner rates in our Smart Option Student Loan originations. On April 26, 2016, we introduced a Private Education Loan product permitting parents to borrow and fund their children s education without a student co-borrower ( Parent Loans ). As our business, capital and balance sheet continue to grow, we also expect to be able to achieve our annual Private Education Loan origination targets for the year without having to sell loans to third-parties. Originations were 8 percent higher in the first nine months of 2016 compared with the year-ago period. The average FICO scores at approval and the cosigner rates for originations in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were 748 and 89.4 percent, compared with 749 and 89.8 percent in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Maintain Our Strong Capital Position 
  We intend to maintain levels of capital at the Bank that significantly exceed those necessary to be considered  well capitalized  by the FDIC. The Company is a source of strength for the Bank and will obtain or provide additional capital as, and if, necessary to the Bank. We regularly evaluate the quality of assets, stability of earnings, and adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, and we continue to believe our existing capital levels are sufficient to support the Bank s plan for significant growth over the next several years while remaining  well capitalized.  As our balance sheet grows in 2016, these ratios will decline but will remain significantly in excess of the capital levels required to be considered  well capitalized  by our regulators. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of   12.4   percent,  a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of   12.4   percent, a Total risk-based capital ratio of   13.4   percent and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of   11.6   percent, all exceeding the current regulatory guidelines for  well capitalized  institutions by a significant amount. We do not plan to pay a common stock dividend or repurchase shares in 2016 (except to repurchase common stock acquired as a result of taxes withheld in connection with award exercises and vesting under our employee stock-based compensation plans).       
  Enhance Customers  Experience By Further Improving Delivery of Products and Services  
  The Spin-Off provided us the opportunity to redesign our processes, procedures and customer experiences exclusively around our Private Education Loan products, rather than accommodating the servicing of those products as well as FFELP and Direct Student Loans serviced under direction of the Department of Education ( DOE ). In 2016, we continue to focus on our new servicing platform and processes to specifically target further simplifications in our customers  Private Education Loan experience. Recent enhancements include: 
             
    All servicing is now conducted by in-house Sallie Mae associates; 
                
    Additional customer service sites have opened to provide redundancy during key processing periods;  
                
    We continue to provide agents with new procedures and technology; 
                
    We increased our efforts to further clarify and simplify customer communications on important topics, such as payment options, by seeking to standardize information across platforms; and  
                
    We continue to expand functionality and information available to our customers online. 
       
  We continue to implement customer feedback processes and gain insights from key points in our customers  experience. 
  
    43 

Sustain Consumer Protection Improvements Made Since the Spin-Off and Further Enhance Our Risk Oversight Infrastructure  
  Since the Spin-Off, we have continued to undertake significant work to establish that all customer protection policies, procedures and compliance management systems are sufficient to meet or exceed currently applicable regulatory standards. Our redesigned SCRA processes and procedures have the approval of the DOJ and all required restitution activities under the FDIC Consent Order and DOJ Consent Order have been completed. In 2014, we engaged a third-party firm to conduct independent audits of consumer protection processes and procedures, including our own compliance management system. At this time, that engagement is ongoing and we are nearing the end of our second full cycle of those audits. To date, these audits have produced no high risk findings. Our goal is to sustain the improvements implemented to date and consistently comply with or exceed regulatory standards while continuing to improve our customers  experience and satisfaction levels. 
  During 2016, we continued the development of our Enterprise Risk Management capability, including significant advances in the Model Risk Management area and enhancements to our Governance, Risk and Compliance platform.  These programs contributed to our successful DFAST submission during the third quarter.  Additionally, the Manager s Assessment of Risk and Controls has entered its second year of use and is proving effective in assisting the first lines of defense in the management of their internal controls.    
  Successfully Launch One or More Complementary New Products to Increase Level of Engagement With Customers  
  In 2015, our management team began to consider expanding the suite of products we provide to customers.  Given our limited time and experience with our new originations platform and servicing capabilities, we prioritized opportunities to focus first on those that can leverage our core competencies and capabilities, rather than require the development or acquisition of new or alternative ones. For example, in the first quarter of 2016, we leveraged our experience with our Smart Option Student Loan products by launching a Parent Loan program designed for parents who wish to separately finance their children s education, rather than cosign loans with their children. We believe there is a market for this product that is separate from the Smart Option Student Loan market, and we believe our product will be a competitive alternative to PLUS loans being offered by the DOE. This product complements our portfolio of Private Education Loan offerings, but is not expected to have a material impact on 2016 earnings. 
  We will also be exploring other product opportunities in 2016. In this process, we also place a high premium on designing and launching products that will be easily understood and attractive to our customers. Any activity in 2016 will focus on success of implementation, and we are not forecasting significant contributions to our originations, revenues or net income from any potential new products in 2016. 
  Manage Operating Expenses While Improving Efficiency 
  We will continue to measure our effectiveness in managing operating expenses by monitoring our non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio. A GAAP-based operating efficiency ratio would compare total non-interest expenses to net revenue (which consists of net interest income, before provisions for credit losses, plus non-interest income). Our operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure because we adjust (a) the non-interest expense numerator by deducting restructuring and other reorganization expenses, and (b) the net revenue denominator by deducting gains on sales of loans, net. We believe doing so provides useful information to investors because it is a measure used by our management team to monitor our effectiveness in managing operating expenses. Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate our ratio. Accordingly, our non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 
  This ratio was   40.6   percent for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   50.3   percent for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This ratio was   40.8   percent for the first   nine   months of 2016, compared with   48.3   percent for the first   nine   months of 2015. The large improvement in the non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the year-ago quarter was partially due to a $9 million increase in other income as a result of an increase in the tax indemnification receivable related to uncertain tax positions. The large improvement in the non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the year-ago period was partially due to a $9 million increase in other income as a result of an increase in the tax indemnification receivable related to uncertain tax positions and the one-time $10 million change in reserve estimates related to our Upromise rewards business recorded in the first quarter of 2016.  We expect this ratio to decline steadily from the full-year 2015 operating efficiency ratio of 46.8 perc 
  
    44 

ent over the next several years as the number of loans on which we earn either net interest income or servicing revenue grows to a level commensurate with our loan origination platform and we control the growth of our expense base.  
  GAAP Results of Operations

GAAP Consolidated Earnings Summary 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , net income was $57 million, or $.12 diluted earnings per common share, compared with net income of $46 million, or $.09 diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income was affected by a $48 million increase in net interest income and a $13 million increase in total non-interest income, which were offset by a $14 million increase in provisions for credit losses, a $6 million increase in total non-interest expenses, and a $29 million increase in income tax expense.  
  The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the current quarter compared with the year-ago quarter are as follows: 
     Net interest income increased by $48 million in the current quarter compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to a $3.0 billion increase in average Private Education Loans outstanding. Net interest margin increased by 22 basis points primarily as a result of an increase in the ratio of higher yielding Private Education Loans relative to our other interest earning assets, which more than offset a 20 basis point increase in our cost of funds. The yields on our interest earning assets and our cost of funds increased primarily as a result of an increase in LIBOR rates that occurred in late 2015.    
     Provisions for credit losses increased $14 million compared with the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in charge-offs in the   third   quarter of 2016, an increase in the Private Education Loan delinquency rate as a percentage of loans in repayment from 1.9 percent at September 30, 2015 to 2.0 percent at September 30, 2016, and a $56 million increase in loans becoming classified as TDRs (where we provide for life-of-loan losses) in the third quarter of 2016 compared with loans becoming classified as TDRs in the third quarter of 2015.  
     Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net, resulted in a net gain of $1 million in the   third   quarter of 2016, from a net loss of $1 million in the year-ago quarter.  
     Other income increased $11 million compared with the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of a $9 million increase in the tax indemnification receivable related to uncertain tax positions.  
     Third-quarter 2016 operating expenses (including acquired intangible asset amortization expense) were $100 million compared with $93 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased marketing costs, FDIC assessment fees and personnel and technology costs, largely driven by growth in our loan portfolio.  
     Income tax expense increased $29 million compared with the year-ago quarter. The effective tax rate increased in the third-quarter 2016 to 45.5 percent from 28.2 percent in the year-ago quarter.  The prior year quarter included a benefit resulting from a release of reserves for uncertain tax positions related to a favorable state tax ruling. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was higher because of an additional $9 million recorded related to uncertain tax positions and due to an increase in state taxes. The uncertain tax positions contributing to the increase in our effective tax rate had no impact on earnings per share, as we recorded the matching offset in other income. Managing our uncertain tax positions will add volatility to our reported effective tax rate, but should not impact our expected cash tax liability. For additional information regarding the uncertain tax positions, see  Correction Recorded in the Current Period  in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $180 million, or $.38 diluted earnings per common share, compared with net income of $184 million, or $.39 diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net income was affected by a $77 million decrease in gains on sales of loans, a $56 million increase in provisions for credit losses and a $17 million increase in total non-interest expenses, which were offset by a $131 million increase in net interest income and a $27 million increase in other income that included a one-time $10 million change in reserve estimates related to our Upromise rewards business. 
  The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the first nine months of 2016 compared with the year-ago period are as follows: 
     Net interest income increased by $131 million in the first nine months compared with the year-ago period primarily due to a $2.7 billion increase in average Private Education Loans outstanding. Net interest margin increased by 24 basis points primarily as a result of an increase in the ratio of higher yielding Private Education Loans relative to our other interest earning  
  
    46 

assets, which more than offset a 15 basis point increase in our cost of funds. The yields on our interest earning assets and our cost of funds increased primarily as a result of an increase in LIBOR rates that occurred in late 2015.   
     Provisions for credit losses increased $56 million compared with the year-ago period. This increase was primarily the result of an additional $471 million of loans entering repayment in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with loans entering repayment in the year-ago period, an increase in the Private Education Loan delinquency rate as a percentage of loans in repayment from 1.9 percent at September 30, 2015 to 2.0 percent at September 30, 2016, and a $90 million increase in loans becoming classified as TDRs (where we provide for life-of-loan losses) in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with loans becoming classified as TDRs in the year-ago period.    
     Gains on sales of loans, net, decreased $77 million as there were no loan sales in the first nine months of 2016.  
     Gains on derivatives and hedging activities, net, resulted in a net gain of $3 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with a net gain of $4 million in the year-ago period.  The primary factors affecting the change were interest rates and whether derivatives qualified for hedge accounting treatment. In the first nine months of 2016, we used fewer derivatives to economically hedge risk that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment than in the year-ago period.  
     Other income increased $27 million compared with the year-ago period.  Of this increase, $10 million relates to a one-time gain resulting from a change in reserve estimates for our Upromise rewards program. Also contributing to this increase is an increase in the tax indemnification receivable related to uncertain tax positions and an increase in third-party servicing income. 
     Operating expenses (including acquired intangible asset amortization expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $288 million compared with $265 million in the year-ago period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased marketing costs, FDIC assessment fees and personnel and technology costs, largely driven by growth in our loan portfolio.  
     Income tax expense increased $11 million compared with the year-ago period. The increase in the first nine months of 2016 effective tax rate to 40.2 percent from 37.3 percent in the year-ago period was primarily as a result of a benefit recorded in the prior year resulting from a release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from a favorable state tax ruling and an additional $9 million recorded in the current year related to uncertain tax positions. For additional information regarding the uncertain tax positions, see  Correction Recorded in the Current Period  in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.   
  Correction Recorded in the Current Period 
  We recognized in the current period adjustments for tax positions relating to historical transactions among entities that are now subsidiaries of Navient that should have been recorded at the time of the Spin-Off, which occurred on April 30, 2014. We have evaluated the quantitative and qualitative materiality of these errors to all of the relevant periods and concluded that the out of period correction to recognize the asset, liabilities and income statement impacts in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 is not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the relevant periods. The adjustments increased our tax indemnification receivable and income taxes payable by $  120   million and increased our other income and income tax expense by $  9   million, as we believe we are indemnified by Navient for these additional tax liabilities. Accordingly, there was no effect on equity or net income as a result of these errors in the current or prior periods. Prospectively, these uncertain tax position liabilities and related assets will be accounted for consistent with our existing accounting policies for these kinds of assets and liabilities. 
        Core Earnings        
  We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also produce and report our after-tax earnings on a separate basis that we refer to as  Core Earnings.  While pre-Spin-Off SLM also reported a metric by that name, what we now report and what we describe below is significantly different and should not be compared to any Core Earnings reported by pre-Spin-Off SLM. The difference between our  Core Earnings  and GAAP results for periods presented generally is driven by the unrealized, mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivatives contracts recognized in GAAP, but not in  Core Earnings.  
   Core Earnings  recognizes the difference in accounting treatment based upon whether a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and eliminates the earnings impact associated with hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives we use as an economic hedge but which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We enter into derivatives instruments to economically hedge interest rate and cash flow risk associated with our portfolio. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy.  Those derivative instruments  
  
    47 

that qualify for hedge accounting treatment have their related cash flows recorded in interest income or interest expense along with the hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness related to these derivatives is recorded in  Gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net.  Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand-alone derivative must be marked-to-fair value in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item.  These gains and losses, recorded in  Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net,  are primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment.  Cash flows on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are not recorded in interest income and interest expense; they are recorded in non-interest income:  Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net.  
   The adjustments required to reconcile from our  Core Earnings  results to our GAAP results of operations, net of tax, relate to differing treatments for our derivative instruments used to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or that do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness, net of tax. The amount recorded in  Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net  includes (a) the accrual of the current payment on the interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (b) the change in fair values related to future expected cash flows for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and (c) ineffectiveness on derivatives that receive hedge accounting treatment. For purposes of  Core Earnings , we are including in GAAP earnings the current period accrual amounts (interest reclassification) on the swaps and excluding the remaining ineffectiveness.   Core Earnings  is meant to represent what earnings would have been had these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting and there was no ineffectiveness.  
   Core Earnings  are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We provide a  Core Earnings  basis of presentation because (i) earnings per share computed on a  Core Earnings  basis is one of several measures we utilize in establishing management incentive compensation and (ii) we believe it better reflects the financial results for derivatives that are economic hedges of interest rate risk but which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
  GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting. Our  Core Earnings  basis of presentation differs from GAAP in the way it treats derivatives as described above.  
  The following table shows the amount in  Gains on derivatives and hedging activities, net  that relates to the interest reclassification on the derivative contracts.

The following table reflects adjustments associated with our derivative activities.  

______ 
  (1) Derivative Accounting:  Core Earnings  exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses caused by the mark-to-market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP, as well as the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges under GAAP.  Under GAAP, for our derivatives held to maturity, the cumulative net unrealized gain or loss over the life of the contract will equal $0.  
    
  (2)  Core Earnings  tax rate is based on the effective tax rate at the Bank where the derivative instruments are held.

Private Education Loan Allowance for Loan Losses 
  In establishing the allowance for Private Education Loan losses as of   September 30, 2016  , we considered several factors with respect to our Private Education Loan portfolio, in particular, credit quality and delinquency, forbearance and charge-off trends. 
  Private Education Loan provision for loan losses increased $14 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the year-ago period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in charge-offs in the third quarter of 2016, an increase in the delinquency rate as a percentage of loans in repayment from 1.9 percent at September 30, 2015 to 2.0 percent at September 30, 2016, and a $56 million increase in loans becoming classified as TDRs (where we provide for life-of-loan losses) in the third quarter of 2016, compared with loans becoming classified as TDRs in the third quarter of 2015.  
  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a $58 million increase in Private Education Loan provisions for credit losses compared with the year-ago period. This increase was primarily the result of an additional $471 million of loans entering repayment in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with loans entering repayment in the year-ago period, an increase in the Private Education Loan delinquency rate as a percentage of loans in repayment from 1.9 percent at September 30, 2015 to 2.0 percent at September 30, 2016, and a $90 million increase in loans becoming classified as TDRs (where we provide for life-of-loan losses) in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with loans becoming classified as TDRs in the year-ago period. 
  For a more detailed discussion of our policy for determining the collectibility of Private Education Loans and maintaining our allowance for Private Education Loan losses, see Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Allowance for Loan Losses  in the 2015 Form 10-K.   
   Prior to the Spin-Off, the Bank sold substantially all its Private Education Loans to several former affiliates, now subsidiaries of Navient (collectively, the  Purchasers ), pursuant to a Loan Participation and Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Spin-Off, the agreement under which the Bank previously made loan sales was amended so the Bank now only has the right to require the Purchasers to purchase loans (at fair value) for which the borrower has a lending relationship with both the Bank and Navient ( Split Loans ) when the Split Loans either (1) are more than 90 days past due; (2) have been restructured; (3) have been granted a hardship forbearance or more than six months of administrative forbearance; or (4) have a borrower or cosigner who has filed for bankruptcy. At   September 30, 2016  , we held approximately $71 million of Split Loans. 
  
    55 

The table below presents our Private Education Loan delinquency trends. Loans in repayment include loans making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period.  

________ 
            (1)   
    Deferment includes customers who have returned to school or are engaged in other permitted educational activities and are not yet required to make payments on their loans (e.g., residency periods for medical students or a grace period for bar exam preparation). 
               (2)   
    Loans for customers who have requested extension of grace period generally during employment transition or who have temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors, consistent with established loan program servicing policies and procedures. 
               (3)   
    The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due.

Changes in allowance for Private Education Loan Losses  
  The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses.  

_______ 
            (1)   
    Represents fair value adjustments on loans sold.  
               (2)   
    Loans in repayment include loans on which borrowers are making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period. 
       
  As part of concluding on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we review key allowance and loan metrics. The most significant of these metrics considered are the allowance coverage of charge-offs ratio; the allowance as a percentage of total loans and of loans in repayment; and delinquency and forbearance percentages. The allowance as a percentage of ending total loans and ending loans in repayment increased at   September 30, 2016   compared with   September 30, 2015   because of an increase in our TDRs (for which we hold a life-of-loan allowance) and an increase in the percentage of loans in full principal and interest repayment status.  
  
    57 

Use of Forbearance as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool     
  Forbearance involves granting the customer a temporary cessation of payments (or temporary acceptance of smaller than scheduled payments) for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total repayment obligation (principal or interest). While in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized to principal when the loan re-enters repayment status. Our forbearance policies include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan. In some instances, we require good-faith payments before granting forbearance. Exceptions to forbearance policies are permitted when such exceptions are judged to increase the likelihood of collection of the loan. Forbearance as a collection tool is used most effectively when applied based on a customer s unique situation, including historical information and judgments. We leverage updated customer information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted forbearance based on our expectations as to a customer s ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at mitigating the overall risk of the portfolio as well as encouraging cash resolution of delinquent loans.  
  Forbearance may be granted to customers who are exiting their grace period to provide additional time to obtain employment and income to support their obligations, or to current customers who are faced with a hardship and request forbearance time to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a customer s loan is placed into a forbearance status in limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month-end during this time. At the end of their granted forbearance period, the customers will enter repayment status as current and are expected to begin making their scheduled monthly payments on a go-forward basis.  
  Forbearance may also be granted to customers who are delinquent in their payments. If specific requirements are met, the forbearance can cure the delinquency and the customer is returned to a current repayment status. In more limited instances, delinquent customers will also be granted additional forbearance time.  
  The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). Active repayment status includes loans on which borrowers are making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period.  Our experience shows that the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At   September 30, 2016  , loans in forbearance status as a percentage of total loans in repayment and forbearance were 2 percent for Private Education Loans that have been in active repayment status for fewer than 25 months. Approximately 78 percent of our Private Education Loans in forbearance status have been in active repayment status fewer than 25 months.

_______ 
            (1)   
    Loans in repayment include loans on which borrowers are making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period. 

Accrued Interest Receivable  
  The following table provides information regarding accrued interest receivable on our Private Education Loans. The table also discloses the amount of accrued interest on loans greater than 90 days past due as compared to our allowance for uncollectible interest. The allowance for uncollectible interest exceeds the amount of accrued interest on our 90 days past due portfolio for all periods presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management  
  Our primary liquidity needs include our ongoing ability to fund our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress, our ongoing ability to fund originations of Private Education Loans and servicing our Bank deposits. To achieve these objectives, we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources, such as deposits at the Bank, issuance of secured debt primarily through asset-backed securitizations and other financing facilities. It is our policy to manage operations so liquidity needs are fully satisfied through normal operations to avoid unplanned asset sales under emergency conditions. Our liquidity management is governed by policies approved by our Board of Directors. Oversight of these policies is performed in the Asset and Liability Committee, a management-level committee.   
   These policies take into account the volatility of cash flow forecasts, expected maturities, anticipated loan demand and a variety of other factors to establish minimum liquidity guidelines. 
  Key risks associated with our liquidity relate to our ability to access the capital markets and the markets for bank deposits at reasonable rates. This ability may be affected by our performance, the macroeconomic environment and the impact they have on the availability of funding sources in the marketplace.

Deposits  
    
  The following table summarizes total deposits. 

Our total deposits of $12.9 billion were comprised of $7.8 billion in brokered deposits and $5.1 billion in retail and other deposits at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $11.5 billion, which were comprised of $7.3 billion in brokered deposits and $4.2 billion in retail and other deposits, at December 31, 2015.  
  Interest Bearing 
  Interest bearing deposits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of retail non-maturity savings deposits, retail and brokered non-maturity MMDAs and brokered and retail CDs. Included in these accounts are what we consider to be core deposits from various sources. Our deposit products are serviced by third-party providers. Placement fees associated with the brokered CDs are amortized into interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We recognized placement fee expense of $  2.6   million and $  2.7   million in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and placement fee expense of   $7.8   million and $  8.0   million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Fees paid to third-party brokers related to brokered CDs were $  1.1   million and $0.5 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $4.0   million and $0.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  
  Interest bearing deposits at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows: 

____________ 
   (1)     Includes the effect of interest rate swaps in effective hedge relationships. 

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, there were $  363.2   million and   $709.9   million, respectively, of deposits exceeding FDIC insurance limits. Accrued interest on deposits was   $24.9   million and   $15.7   million at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.    
    
  Non-Interest Bearing 
    
  Non-interest bearing deposits were $  0.3   million and $  0.7   million as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. For both periods, these were comprised of money market accounts related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan account. 
  
    62 

Counterparty Exposure  
  Counterparty exposure related to financial instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us.  
  Excess cash is generally invested with the FRB on an overnight basis or in the FRB s Term Deposit Facility, minimizing counterparty exposure on cash balances.   
  Our investment portfolio includes a small portfolio of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises that are purchased to meet Community Reinvestment Act targets. Additionally, our investing activity is governed by Board-approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment.  
  Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Credit Support Annexes ( CSAs ), or clearinghouses for over-the-counter derivatives. CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by the Bank are covered under such agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position, less any collateral held by us and plus collateral posted with the counterparty.  
  Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires all standardized derivatives, including most interest rate swaps, to be submitted for clearing to central intermediaries to reduce counterparty risk.  As of   September 30, 2016  , $5.6 billion notional of our derivative contracts were cleared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Clearing House. This represents 91.1 percent of our total notional derivative contracts of $6.1 billion. All derivative contracts cleared through an exchange require collateral to be exchanged based on the fair value of the derivative. Our exposure is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position, less collateral held by us and plus collateral posted with the counterparty.   
  We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties.  
  The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties as of   September 30, 2016  .

Regulatory Capital  
  The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking authorities.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.  Under the U. S Basel III capital framework and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital standards that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and its classification under the prompt corrective action framework are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. 
    Well capitalized  regulatory requirements are the quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy.  To qualify as  well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below)  
  
    63 

of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets.  The following capital amounts and ratios are based upon the Bank s assets.  

Capital Management 
  The Bank seeks to remain  well capitalized  at all times with sufficient capital to support asset growth, operating needs, unexpected credit risks and to protect the interests of depositors and the FDIC - administered Deposit Insurance Fund.  The Bank is required by its regulators, the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC, to comply with mandated capital ratios.  We intend to maintain levels of capital at the Bank that significantly exceed the levels of capital necessary to be considered  well capitalized  by the FDIC.  The Company is a source of strength for the Bank and will provide additional capital if necessary. The Board of Directors and management periodically evaluate the quality of assets, the stability of earnings, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for the Bank. We currently believe that current and projected capital levels are appropriate for 2016. As our balance sheet continues to grow in 2016, these ratios will decline but will remain significantly in excess of the capital levels required to be considered  well capitalized  by our regulators. We do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock. We do not intend to initiate share repurchase programs as a means to return capital to shareholders. We only expect to repurchase common stock acquired in connection with taxes withheld as a result of award exercises and vesting under our employee stock-based compensation plans. Our Board of Directors will periodically reconsider these matters. 
  As of January 1, 2015, the Bank was required to comply with U.S. Basel III, which is aimed at increasing both the quantity and quality of regulatory capital and, among other things, establishes Common Equity Tier 1 as a new tier of capital and modifies methods for calculating risk-weighted assets.  Certain aspects of U.S. Basel III, including new deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital and a new capital conservation buffer, are being phased in over several years. The Bank s Capital Policy requires management to monitor the new capital standards.  The Bank is subject to the following minimum capital ratios under U.S. Basel III: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent, a Total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 percent.  In addition, the Bank is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which will be phased in over three years beginning January 1, 2016: 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25 percent for 2017, and 1.875 percent for 2018, with the fully phased-in level of greater than 2.5 percent effective as of January 1, 2019.  Failure to maintain the buffer will result in restrictions on the Bank s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.  Including the buffer, by January 1, 2019, the Bank will be required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 7.0 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 8.5 percent and a Total risk-based capital ratio of greater than 10.5 percent. 
  U.S. Basel III also revised the capital thresholds for the prompt corrective action framework for insured depository institutions. Effective January 1, 2015, in order to qualify as  well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain a Common Equity Tier  
  
    64 

1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent. 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.4 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.4 percent, a Total risk-based capital ratio of 13.4 percent and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.6 percent, which are each well in excess of the current  well capitalized  standard for insured depository institutions. If calculated today based on the fully phased-in U.S. Basel III standards, our ratios would also exceed the capital levels required under U.S. Basel III and the  well capitalized  standard. 
  Dividends 
    
  The Bank is chartered under the laws of the State of Utah and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to the laws of Utah and the regulations of the FDIC. Generally, under Utah s industrial bank laws and regulations as well as FDIC regulations, the Bank may pay dividends from its net profits without regulatory approval if, following the payment of the dividend, the Bank s capital and surplus would not be impaired. The Bank paid   no   dividends for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . For the foreseeable future, we expect the Bank to only pay dividends to the Company as may be necessary to provide for regularly scheduled dividends payable on the Company s Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. 
  Borrowings 
    
  Outstanding borrowings consist of secured borrowings executed through our term ABS program and our ABCP Facility. The issuing entities for those secured borrowings are VIEs and are consolidated for accounting purposes. The following table summarizes our secured borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

On May 26, 2016, we executed our $  551   million SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2016-A term ABS transaction, which was accounted for as an on-balance sheet secured financing. We retained a   100   percent or $  50 million   interest in the Class B notes and   100   percent of the residual certificates issued in the securitization.   $501 million   of Class A notes from the securitization were sold to third parties, raising $  501 million   of gross proceeds. At   September 30, 2016  , $  571 million   of our Private Education Loans were encumbered as a result of this transaction.  
  On July 21, 2016, we executed our $  657   million SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2016-B term ABS transaction, which was accounted for as an on-balance sheet secured financing. We retained a   100 percent   or $  50 million   interest in the Class B notes and   100 percent   of the residual certificates issued in the securitization. $  607 million   of Class A notes from the securitization were sold to third parties, raising $  607 million   of gross proceeds. At   September 30, 2016  , $  692 million   of our Private Education Loans were encumbered as a result of this transaction.  
  Borrowed Funds 
  The Bank maintains discretionary uncommitted Federal Funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, which totaled $100 million at   September 30, 2016  . The interest rate charged to the Bank on these lines of credit is priced at Fed Funds plus a spread at the time of borrowing, and is payable daily. The Bank did not utilize these lines of credit in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and in the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  
    65 

The Bank established an account at the FRB to meet eligibility requirements for access to the Primary Credit borrowing facility at the FRB s Window. The Primary Credit borrowing facility is a lending program available to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. All borrowings at the Window must be fully collateralized. We can pledge to the FRB asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, as well as FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans, as collateral for borrowings at the Window. Generally, collateral value is assigned based on the estimated fair value of the pledged assets. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the value of our pledged collateral at the FRB totaled   $2.5   billion and   $1.7   billion, respectively. The interest rate charged to us is the discount rate set by the FRB. We did not utilize this facility in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and in the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Contractual Loan Commitments 
  When we approve a Private Education Loan at the beginning of an academic year, that approval may cover the borrowing for the entire academic year.  As such, we do not always disburse the full amount of the loan at the time of such approval, but instead have a commitment to fund a portion of the loan at a later date (usually at the start of the second semester or subsequent trimesters). At   September 30, 2016  , we had $1.8 billion of outstanding contractual loan commitments which we expect to fund during the remainder of the 2016/2017 academic year. At   September 30, 2016  , we had a $  1.6 million   reserve recorded in  Other Liabilities  to cover expected losses that we conclude are probable to occur during the   one   year loss emergence period on these unfunded commitments.  
     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. A discussion of our critical accounting policies, which include allowance for loan losses, fair value measurement, transfers of financial assets and the VIE consolidation model, and derivative accounting, can be found in our 2015 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to these critical accounting policies during the third quarter of 2016.

Item 3.  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
     Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
  Our interest rate risk management program seeks to manage and control interest rate risk, thereby reducing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and achieving consistent and acceptable levels of profit in any rate environment and sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term. We evaluate and monitor interest rate risk through two primary methods: 
     Earnings at Risk ( EAR ), which measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on net interest income; and 
     Economic Value of Equity ( EVE ), which measures the sensitivity or change in the economic value of equity to changes in interest rates. 
  A number of potential interest rate scenarios are simulated using our asset liability management system.  The Bank is the primary source of interest rate risk within the Company. The majority of the Bank s assets are priced off of 1-month LIBOR.  Therefore, 1-month LIBOR is considered a core rate in our interest rate risk analysis.  Many other interest rate changes are correlated to changes in 1-month LIBOR, with higher or lower correlations based on historical relationships or on management s judgment of future rate trends.  Rates are adjusted up or down via a set of scenarios that includes both rate shocks and ramps. Rate shocks represent an immediate and sustained change in 1-month LIBOR with the resulting changes in other indices correlated accordingly. Interest rate ramps represent a linear increase in 1-month LIBOR over the course of 12 months with the resulting changes in other indices correlated accordingly. 
  The following table summarizes the potential effect on earnings over the next 24 months and the potential effect on fair values of balance sheet assets and liabilities at   September 30,   2016 and 2015, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points while funding spreads remain constant. The EVE sensitivity is applied only to financial assets and liabilities, including hedging instruments that existed at the balance sheet date, and does not take into account new assets, liabilities or hedging instruments that may arise in the future. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we made a minor change to our interest rate sensitivity model. As the result of an evaluation of historical data, correlation coefficients between certain short-term rate indices to 1-month LIBOR were increased for interest rate risk modeling purposes, increasing our measured sensitivity to changes in market rates. These rate indices included the Fed Funds effective rate, Prime rate and the 3-month Treasury rate, among others. We believe using higher coefficients will provide improved modeling accuracy. The most significant impact of this change was the impact on the treatment of our cash balances, which are placed at the FRB as excess deposits, earning the Fed Funds discount rate. This change resulted in a slightly higher measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes at September 30, 2016, as measured by the EAR analysis, when compared with the prior year. 

A primary objective in our funding is to manage our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our assets with liabilities of similar interest rate repricing characteristics. This funding objective is frequently obtained through the use of derivatives. Uncertainty in loan repayment cash flows and the pricing behavior of our non-maturity retail deposits pose  
  
    67 

challenges in achieving our interest rate risk objectives. In addition to these considerations, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. 
  As part of its suite of financial products, the Bank offers fixed-rate Private Education Loans. As with other Private Education Loans, the term to maturity is lengthy, and the customer has the option to repay the loan faster than the promissory note requires. Asset securitization provides long-term fixed-rate funding for some of these assets. Additionally, a portion of the fixed-rate loans have been hedged with derivatives, which have been used to convert a portion of variable rate funding to fixed-rate to match the anticipated cash flows of these loans. Any unhedged position arising from the fixed-rate loan portfolio is monitored and modeled to ensure that the interest rate risk does not cause the Company to exceed its policy limits for earnings at risk or for the value of equity at risk.  
  In the preceding tables, the interest rate sensitivity analysis reflects the heavy balance sheet mix of fully variable LIBOR-based loans, which exceeds the mix of fully variable funding, which in turn includes brokered CDs that have been converted to LIBOR through derivative transactions. The analysis does not anticipate that retail MMDAs or retail savings balances, while relatively sensitive to interest rate changes, will reprice to the full extent of interest rate shocks or ramps. Partially offsetting this asset sensitive position, is (i) the impact of FFELP loans, which receive Floor Income in low interest rate environments, and will therefore not reprice fully with interest rate shocks and (ii) the impact of a portion of our fixed-rate loans that have not been fully match-funded through derivative transactions and fixed-rate funding from asset securitization. The overall slightly asset-sensitive position will generally cause net interest income to increase somewhat over the near term when interest rates rise.  Over the long term, however, the EVE sensitivity analysis shows a nearly rate neutral position. 
  Although we believe that these measurements provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity, they do not account for potential changes in credit quality, balance sheet mix and size of our balance sheet. They also do not account for other business developments that could affect net income, or for management actions that could affect net income or could be taken to change our risk profile. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations. Further, such simulations do not represent our current view of expected future interest rate movements.

Asset and Liability Funding Gap  
  The table below presents our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of   September 30, 2016  . In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest income, as opposed to those reflected in the  gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net  line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. (Note that all fixed-rate assets and liabilities are aggregated into one line item, which does not capture the differences in time due to maturity.) 

______________________ 
            (1)     
    Funding (by index) includes the impact of all derivatives that qualify as hedges. 
       
            (2)     
    Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes liquid retail deposits and the obligation to return cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures.  
               (3)     
    Assets include receivables and other assets (including premiums and reserves). Funding includes unswapped time deposits, liquid MMDA's swapped to fixed rates and stockholders' equity.  
       
  The  Funding Gap  in the above table shows primarily mismatches in the 1-month LIBOR, fixed-rate, 3-month LIBOR and Non-Discrete categories. As changes in 1-month and 3-month LIBOR are generally quite highly correlated, the funding gap associated with 3-month LIBOR is expected to partially offset the 1-month LIBOR gaps. We consider the overall risk to be moderate since the funding in the Non-Discrete bucket is our liquid retail portfolio, which we have significant flexibility to reprice at any time, and the funding in the fixed-rate bucket includes $1.9 billion of equity and $0.5 billion of non-interest bearing liabilities. In addition, the fixed-rate funding position includes $1.3 billion of brokered CDs, which have been swapped to 1-month LIBOR, but do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
  We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. Our asset liability management strategy is to match assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that have the same underlying index and reset frequency or have interest rate characteristics that we believe are highly correlated. The use of funding with index types and reset frequencies that are different from our assets exposes us to interest rate risk in the form of basis and repricing risk. This could result in our cost of funds not moving in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the yield on our assets. While we believe this risk is low, as all of these indices are short-term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions (which have occurred in recent years) can lead to a temporary divergence between indices resulting in a negative impact to our earnings.

Item 4.  
    Controls and Procedures  
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings  
       
  Legal Proceedings  
  We and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other actions that arise in the normal course of business. It is common for the Company, our subsidiaries and affiliates to receive information and document requests and investigative demands from state attorneys general, legislative committees and administrative agencies. These requests may be for informational or regulatory purposes and may relate to our business practices, the industries in which we operate, or other companies with whom we conduct business. Our practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with these bodies and be responsive to any such requests. 
  Pursuant to the terms of the Spin-Off and applicable law, Navient assumed responsibility for all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether known or unknown) arising out of or resulting from the conduct of pre-Spin-Off SLM and its subsidiaries  businesses prior to the Spin-Off, other than certain specifically identified liabilities relating to the conduct of our consumer banking business. Nonetheless, given the prior usage of the Sallie Mae and SLM names by entities now owned by Navient, we and our subsidiaries may from time to time be improperly named as defendants in legal proceedings where the allegations at issue are the legal responsibility of Navient. Most of these legal proceedings involve matters that arose in whole or in part in the ordinary course of business of pre-Spin-Off SLM. Likewise, as the period of time since the Spin-Off increases, so does the likelihood any allegations that may be made may be in part for our own actions in a post-Spin-Off time period and in part for Navient s conduct in a pre-Spin-Off time period. We will not be providing information on these proceedings unless there are material issues of fact or disagreement with Navient as to the bases of the proceedings or responsibility therefor that we believe could have a material, adverse impact on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity or outlook if not resolved in our favor.   
    
  For a description of these and other litigation or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party, and for which we have no current updates, see our 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Regulatory Update  
    
  At the time of this filing, the Bank remains subject to the FDIC Consent Order and the DOJ Consent Order. On May 13, 2014, the Bank reached a settlement with the DOJ regarding compliance issues with the SCRA.  At the same time, the Bank reached a settlement with the FDIC regarding disclosures and assessments of certain late fees, as well as compliance with the SCRA. Under the FDIC Consent Order, the Bank paid $3.3 million in fines and oversaw the refund of up to $30 million in late fees, funded by Navient as required by the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, assessed on loans owned or originated by the Bank since its inception in November 2005. The DOJ Consent Order was approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on September 29, 2014. 
    
  Under the DOJ Consent Order, Navient is solely responsible for reimbursing SCRA benefits and related compensation on behalf of both its subsidiary, Navient Solutions, Inc., and the Bank. 
    
  We believe the Bank has complied with all the requirements of the FDIC Consent Order and the DOJ Consent Order.  This includes implementing new SCRA policies, procedures and training, updated billing statement disclosures, steps to ensure its third-party service providers are also fully compliant in these regards, and overseeing Navient s restitution responsibilities. Notwithstanding the CFPB s assumption of the role of the Bank s primary consumer compliance regulator in January 2015, the FDIC will continue to monitor the Bank s improved compliance management system, policies and procedures until it is satisfied the Bank has demonstrated its ability to sustain the enhancements and additions implemented in response to the FDIC Consent Order. Pursuant to the terms of the DOJ Consent Order, the Bank will remain subject to certain DOJ reporting and record-keeping requirements until September 29, 2018. 
  In May 2014, the Bank received a CID from the CFPB as part of the CFPB s separate investigation relating to customer complaints, fees and charges assessed in connection with the servicing of student loans and related collection practices of pre-Spin-Off SLM by entities now subsidiaries of Navient during a time period prior to the Spin-Off. Two state attorneys general  
  
    72 

have provided the Bank identical CIDs and others have become involved in the inquiry over time. To the extent requested, we have been cooperating fully with the CFPB and the attorneys general but are not in a position at this time to predict the duration or outcome of the investigation. Given the timeframe covered by this demand and the focus on practices and procedures previously conducted by Navient and its servicing subsidiaries, Navient is leading the response to this investigation and has accepted responsibility for all costs, expenses, losses or remediation that may arise from this investigation. 
  Item 1A.     Risk Factors  
  Our business activities involve a variety of risks. In addition to the risk factor below, readers should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of our 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  Consolidation or refinancing of existing Private Education Loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Since 2010, both the number of bills introduced in the United States Congress to promote Federal financing for consolidation or refinancing of existing student loans, as well as the number of lenders offering similar products, have increased. To date, we have experienced no significant increase in consolidation or refinancing of our existing Private Education Loans. We believe the design of our products, with emphasis on rigorous underwriting, credit-worthy cosigners and variable interest rates, creates sustainable, competitive loan products. However, a prolonged introduction of significant amounts of subsidized funding into the Private Education Loan market at below market interest rates - whether from Federal or private sources - could increase the prepayment rates of our existing Private Education Loans and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Share Repurchases 
  The following table provides information relating to our purchase of shares of our common stock in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

               (2)     
     At the present time, the Company does not have a publicly announced share repurchase plan or program.  
     The closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on   September 30, 2016   was $7.47.
