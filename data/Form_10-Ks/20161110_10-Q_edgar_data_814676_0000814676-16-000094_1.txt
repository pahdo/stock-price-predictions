    Notes
to Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

   (1) 
Nature of Business   

  CPS
Technologies Corporation (the  Company  or  CPS ) provides advanced material solutions to the electronics,
power generation, automotive and other industries.   The Company s primary advanced material solution is metal-matrix
composites which are a combination of metal and ceramic.  

CPS also assembles
housings and packages for hybrid circuits. These housings and packages may include components made of metal-matrix composites
or they may include components made of more traditional materials such as aluminum, copper-tungsten, etc. 

  The
Company sells into several end markets including the wireless communications infrastructure market, high-performance microprocessor
market, motor controller market, and other microelectronic and structural markets.  

(2) 
Interim Financial Statements   

  As
permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, these notes are
condensed and do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  

The
accompanying financial statements are unaudited.  In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements of CPS
reflect all normal recurring adjustments which are necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations
for such periods.  

The
Company s balance sheet at December 26, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does
not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for complete financial statements.  

For
further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Registrant s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015.  

The
results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  

(3) 
Net Income Per Common and Common Equivalent Share   

  Basic
net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by
the sum of the weighted average number of common shares plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential
dilutive common shares had been issued for granted stock options and stock purchase rights.  Common stock equivalents are
excluded from the diluted calculations when a net loss is incurred as they would be anti-dilutive.  

The
following table presents the calculation of both basic and diluted EPS:  

(4) 
Share-Based Payments   

  The
Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date
fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange
for the award, the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company provides an estimate of forfeitures at initial
grant date. Reductions in compensation expense associated with the forfeited options are estimated at the date of grant, and this
estimated forfeiture rate is adjusted periodically based on actual forfeiture experience. The company uses the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options granted.  

There
were no stock options granted under the Plan during the quarters ended October 1, 2016 and September 26, 2015.  

During
the quarter ended October 1, 2016 there were no shares issued and during the quarter ended September 26, 2015 the Company issued
6,000 shares as a result of option exercises. During the quarter ended October 1, 2016 1,200 options expired. No options expired
during the quarter ended September 26, 2015.  

During
the quarter ended October 1, 2016 there were no shares repurchased. During the quarter ended September 26, 2015 the Company repurchased
3,923 shares from employees to facilitate their exercise of stock options.  

During
the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 the Company recognized approximately $37 thousand and $153 thousand, respectively
as share-based compensation expense related to previously granted shares under the Plan. A tax benefit of approximately $3 thousand
was recognized as additional paid in capital in the nine months ended October 1, 2016 resulting from the excess tax benefit of
option exercises.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015 the Company recognized approximately $84 thousand and $227 thousand, respectively
as share-based compensation expense related to previously granted shares under the Plan. A tax benefit of approximately $49 thousand
was recognized as additional paid in capital in the nine months ended September 26, 2015 resulting from the excess tax benefit
of option exercises.

expenses consist of the following:  

(7) 
Line of Credit and Equipment Lease Facility Agreements    

  In
May 2016, the Company renewed its $2 million revolving line of credit ( LOC ) and $500 thousand of an equipment
finance facility ( Lease Line ) with Santander Bank.   Both agreements mature in May 2017.  The LOC
is secured by the accounts receivable and other assets of the Company, has an interest rate of prime and a one-year term. Under
the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to maintain its operating accounts with Santander Bank. The LOC and the Lease
Line are cross defaulted and cross collateralized. The Company is also subject to certain financial covenants within the terms
of the LOC that require the Company to maintain a targeted coverage ratio as well as targeted debt to equity and current ratios.
At October 1, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all existing covenants.  At October 1, 2016, the Company had not utilized
the equipment finance facility and therefore had $500 thousand available. At October 1, 2016 the Company had no borrowings under
this LOC and its borrowing base at the time would have permitted an additional $1,229 thousand to have been borrowed.  

(8) 
Income Taxes   

  The
Company has a current and non-current deferred tax asset aggregating $2,390,563 and $2,150,749 on the Company s balance
sheet at October 1, 2016 and December 26, 2015, respectively.  A valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained
when it is  more likely than not  that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company believes
that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining deferred tax assets
and as such no valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax asset. At the end of 2015 the Company had utilized
all of its net operating loss carryforwards.  

The
Company recorded a tax benefit of $146,440 and $177,720 for federal income taxes and a tax benefit of $50,460 and $59,280 for
state income taxes during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016, respectively.  

The Company recorded a tax expense of $5,000 and $100,520 for federal income taxes and a tax expense of $2,000 and $28,980 for
state income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015, respectively.  

(9) 
Commitments   

  The
Company entered into a 10-year lease for the Norton facilities effective on March 1, 2006. The leased facilities comprise approximately
38 thousand square feet. In January 2016 this lease was amended to extend the lease to February 28, 2017. As part of the agreement
the Company obtained two, one-year options which enable the Company to continue to lease through February 28, 2019. In June 2016
the Company exercised the option to extend the lease through February 28, 2018.  The lease is a triple net lease wherein
the Company is responsible for payment of all real estate taxes, operating costs and utilities.  The Company also has an
option to buy the property and a first right of refusal during the term of the lease.  Annual rental payments are $100 thousand
in year one increasing to $152 thousand at the end of the extended term.  

In
February 2011, the Company entered into a lease for an additional 13.8 thousand square feet in Attleboro, MA. The lease term is
for one year and has an option to extend the lease for five additional one-year periods. Monthly rent, which includes utilities,
is $6,900. The Company renewed the lease in 2013 for one additional year and also obtained two years of additional options which
could extend the Company use through February 2019.  In October 2015, the Company exercised its option to extend the lease
through the end of February 2017.

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The critical accounting policies utilized by the Company in preparation of the accompanying financial statements are set forth
in Part II, Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015, under the heading  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .  There have been no material changes to
these policies since December 26, 2015.  

Overview   

CPS Technologies Corporation (the  Company  or  CPS ) provides advanced material solutions to the electronics,
power generation, automotive and other industries. In 2008 the Company also entered into a cooperative agreement with the U.S.
Army to further develop its composite technology to produce armor. The Cooperative Agreement was a four-year agreement which was
subsequently extended through March 31, 2015.  

The Company s products are generally used in high-power, high-reliability applications. These applications always involve
energy use or energy generation and the Company s products allow higher performance and improved energy efficiency. The
Company is an important participant in the growing movement towards alternative energy and  green  lifestyles. For example,
the Company s products are used in mass transit, hybrid and electric cars, wind-turbines for electricity generation as well
as routers and switches for the internet which in turn allows telecommuting.  

The Company s primary advanced material solution is metal matrix composites (MMCs), a new class of materials which are a
combination of metal and ceramic. CPS has a leading, proprietary position in metal matrix composites. Metal matrix composites
have several superior properties compared to conventional materials including improved thermal conductivity, thermal expansion
matching, stiffness and light weight which enable higher performance and higher reliability in our customers  products.  

Like plastics several decades ago, we believe metal-matrix composites will penetrate many end markets over many years. CPS management
believes our business model of providing advanced material solutions to a portfolio of high growth end markets which are, at any
point in time, in various stages of the technology adoption lifecycle, provides CPS with the opportunity for sustained growth
and a diversified customer base. We believe we have validated this model as we are now supplying customers at all stages of the
technology adoption lifecycle.  

CPS is the leader in supplying metal matrix composites to certain high growth electronics end markets which are well along in
the adoption lifecycle and therefore generating significant demand. These end markets include high-performance integrated circuits
and circuit boards used in internet switches and routers, as well as motor controllers used in high-speed electric trains, subway
cars and wind turbines.   CPS supplies heat spreaders, lids and baseplates to customers in these end markets. CPS is
a fully qualified manufacturer for many of the world s largest electronics OEMs.  

CPS
also assembles housings and packages for hybrid circuits. These housings and packages may include components made of metal-matrix
composites; they may include components made of more traditional materials such as aluminum, copper-tungsten, etc.  

A
market at an earlier stage of the adoption lifecycle is the market for hybrid and electric automobiles.  In 2012 the Company
announced a multi-year supply agreement with a major tier one automotive supplier for the supply of AlSiC pin fin baseplates for
use in motor controllers for hybrid and electric automobiles.  

We
are also actively working with customers in end markets at the beginning stages of the adoption lifecycle. An example of such
a market is the market for armor. In 2008 the Company entered into a cooperative agreement with the Army Research Laboratory to
further develop large hybrid metal matrix composite modules which integrally combine metal matrix composites and ceramics by enveloping
ceramic tiles with MMCs. This system offers a lighter weight, durable, multi-hit capable and cost competitive alternative to conventional
steel, aluminum and ceramic based armor systems. CPS hybrid hard face armor modules are comprised of multiple materials completely
enveloped within and mechanically and chemically bonded to lightweight and stiff aluminum metal matrix composites.  

The
Company believes that its hybrid hard face armor tiles will find application in many military vehicles as well as armored commercial
vehicles.  

Our
products are manufactured by proprietary processes we have developed including the Quickset TM  Injection Molding Process
( Quickset Process ) and the QuickCast TM  Pressure Infiltration Process ( QuickCast Process ).  

CPS
was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1984 as Ceramics Process Systems Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1987
through a merger into a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary organized for purposes of the reincorporation. In July 1987, CPS completed
our initial public offering of 1.5 million shares of our Common Stock. In March 2007, we changed our name from Ceramics Process
Systems Corporation to CPS Technologies Corporation.  

Results
of Operations for the Third Fiscal Quarter of 2016 (Q3 2016) Compared to the Third Fiscal Quarter of 2015 (Q3 2015); (all $ in
000 s)   

Total
revenue was $3,327 in Q3 2016, a 39% decrease compared with total revenue of $ 5,423 in Q3 2015.  About half of this decrease
was due to a reduction in the sales of baseplates.  Sales of hermetic packages, fracking balls and lids were also down from
the previous year contributing to the shortfall.  

Gross
margin in Q3 2016 totaled $386 or 12% of sales.  In Q3 2015, gross margin was $ 974 or 18% of sales.   This decline
in margin was due largely to the decline in revenues, offset in part by a reduction in the spending for factory support costs.  

Selling,
general and administrative (SG A) expenses were $763 in Q3 2016, 21% less than SG A expenses of $960 in Q3 2015. 
This decrease was due largely to a reduction in commissions related to volume, lower levels of incentive compensation and expenses
for professional fees.  

The
operating loss for Q3 2016 totaled $377 compared with an operating profit of $14 in Q3 2015.  This decrease was primarily
due to lower sales, offset in part by a reduction in spending for factory support costs and SG A.  

The
company generated other income in Q3, 2016 of $40 due to the sale of used equipment in excess of book value.   There
was no other income in Q3, 2015.  

The
company experienced a net loss in Q3 2016 for $139 compared with net income of $8 in Q3 2015.  The variance was due in large
part to the same factors that contributed to the variance at the operating income level.  

Results
of Operations for the First Nine Months of 2016 Compared to the First Nine Months of 2015 (all $ in 000 s)   

Total
revenue was $12,478 in the first nine months of 2016, a 24% decrease compared with total revenue of $16,349 in the first nine
months of 2015. This decrease was due to a reduction in the sales of baseplates, hermetic packages, fracking balls and lids, offset
in small part by an increase in armor revenues.  There were no significant price changes during the first nine months of
2016 compared with the first nine months of 2016.  

Gross
margin in the first nine months of 2016 totaled $2,078 or 17% of sales.  This compares with $3,409, or 21% of sales, generated
during the first nine months of 2015.   This decline in margin was due to lower revenues, offset in part by reduced
spending on factory support costs.  

Selling,
general and administrative (SG A) expenses were $2,564 during the first nine months of 2016, down 17% compared with SG A
expenses of $3,085 incurred during the first nine months of 2015.  This reduction was due to lower accruals for incentive
compensation, lower sales commissions related to lower revenues, and a reduction in 401K expenses, professional and legal fees. 
These reductions were offset in a small part by higher spending for sales and marketing activities in China.  

The
company generated other income in the first nine months of 2016 totaling $40 due to the sale of used equipment in excess of book
value.   There was no other income during the same period of 2015.  

As
a result of lower volume, offset in part by spending on factory overhead and SG A costs, the Company incurred an operating
loss of $486 in the first nine months of 2016, compared with an operating profit of $323 in the same period last year.  The
net loss for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $200 versus a net income of $196 in the first nine months of 2015.  

The
Company continues to sell to a limited number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers could cause the Company
to require additional external financing. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or reduce certain discretionary spending could
have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its business objectives.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources (all $ in 000 s unless noted)   

  The
Company s cash and cash equivalents at October 1, 2016 totaled $3,458 compared with cash and cash equivalents at December
26, 2015 of $3,413.  This increase was due to a reduction in working capital, offset by operating losses and, to a lesser
extent, capital expenditures in excess of depreciation.  

  Accounts
receivable at October 1, 2016 totaled $2,456 compared with $3,572 at December 26, 2015. Days Sales Outstanding (DSOs) increased
from 59 days at the end of 2015 to 66 days at the end of Q3, 2016. Both of these statistics are consistent with historical patterns.  

Inventories
totaled $2,142 at October 1, 2016, compared with inventories of $2,632 at December 26, 2015. The inventory turnover in 2015 was
6.5 times (based on a 5 point average) and 5.9 times for the most recent four quarters ending Q3 2016.  

All
consigned inventory is shipped under existing purchase orders and per customers  requests. Of the inventory of $2,142 at
October 1, 2016, $802 was located at customers  locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements. Of the total inventory
of $2.632 at December 26, 2015, $763 was located at customers  locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements.  

The
Company financed its working capital during Q3 2016 with a combination of cash balances and funds generated from operations. 
The Company expects it will continue to be able to fund its working capital requirements for the remainder of 2016 from a combination
of operating cash flow, existing cash balances and borrowings under its line of credit, if necessary.  

Contractual
Obligations  (all $ in 000 s)    

  In
early May 2016, the Company renewed its $2,000 revolving line of credit ( LOC ) and $500 of an equipment finance
facility ( Lease Line ) with Santander Bank.   Both agreements mature in May 2017.  The LOC is secured
by the accounts receivable and other assets of the Company, has an interest rate of prime and a one-year term. Under the terms
of the agreement, the Company is required to maintain its operating accounts with Santander Bank. The LOC and the Lease Line are
cross defaulted and cross collateralized. The Company is also subject to certain financial covenants within the terms of the LOC
that require the Company to maintain a targeted coverage ratio as well as targeted debt to equity and current ratios. At October
1, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all existing covenants.  At October 1, 2016, the Company had not utilized the
equipment finance facility and therefore had $500 available. At October 1, 2016 the Company had no borrowings under this LOC and
its borrowing base at the time would have permitted an additional $1,229 to have been borrowed.  

The
financial covenants with Santander Bank are identical for the LOC and Lease Line. The covenant requirements are shown below together
with the actual ratios achieved:

Management
believes that cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and the leasing and credit line in place with Santander Bank
will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. However, there is no assurance that we will be able
to generate sufficient revenues or reduce certain discretionary spending in the event that planned operational goals are not met
such that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due.  

As
of October 1, 2016 the Company had $787 thousand of construction in progress and no outstanding commitments to purchase production
equipment.  The Company intends to finance production equipment in construction in progress and outstanding commitments under
the lease agreement with existing cash balances and funds generated by operations.  

The
Company entered into a 10-year lease for the Norton facilities effective on March 1, 2006. The leased facilities comprise approximately
38 thousand square feet. In January 2016 this lease was amended to extend the lease to February 28, 2017.  As part of the
agreement the Company obtained two, one-year options which enabled it to continue to lease through February 28, 2019. In June
2016 the Company exercised the option to extend the lease through February 28, 2018 The lease is a triple net lease wherein the
Company is responsible for payment of all real estate taxes, operating costs and utilities.  The Company also has an option
to buy the property and a first right of refusal during the term of the lease.  Annual rental payments are $100 thousand
in year one increasing to $152 thousand at the end of the extended term.  

In
February 2011, the Company entered into a lease for an additional 13.8 thousand square feet in Attleboro, MA. The lease term is
for one year and has an option to extend the lease for five additional one-year periods. Monthly rent, which includes utilities,
is $6,900. The Company renewed the lease in 2013 for one additional year and also obtained two years of additional options which
could extend the Company use through February 2019.  In October 2015, the Company exercised its option to extend the lease
through the end of February 2017.

Company s contractual obligations at October 1, 2016 consist of the following:
