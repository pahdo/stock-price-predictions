  1.    Organization and Description of Business  
  Penumbra, Inc. (the  Company ) is a global interventional therapies company that designs, develops, manufactures and markets innovative medical devices. The Company has a broad portfolio of products that addresses challenging medical conditions and significant clinical needs across   two   major markets, neuro and peripheral vascular. The conditions that the Company s products address include, among others, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and various peripheral vascular conditions that can be treated through thrombectomy and embolization procedures.  
   
  2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are unaudited. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. 
   The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to state fairly the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of its operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or for any other future annual or interim period.   Certain changes in presentation were made in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to conform to the presentation for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company     s Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity accounts; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to marketable investments, provisions for doubtful accounts, sales return reserve, warranty reserves, valuation of inventories, useful lives of property and equipment, income taxes, and contingencies, among others. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other data. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Segments    
  The Company determined its operating segment on the same basis that it uses to evaluate its performance internally. The Company has   one   business activity: the design, development, manufacturing and marketing of innovative medical devices, and operates as   one   operating segment. The Company s chief operating decision-maker, its Chief Executive Officer, reviews its

  (unaudited) 

operating results for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company determines revenue by geographic area, based on the destination to which it ships its products.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which outlines a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ,     which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations contained in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which further clarifies the implementation guidance relating to identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance.   In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     Narrow-Scope improvements and Practical Expedients  , which further clarifies the implementation on narrow scope improvements and practical expedients. These standards will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 pursuant to ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  -  Deferral of the Effective Date  ,     issued by the FASB in August 2015.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these standards.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which requires an entity to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The accounting standard is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which   addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments  . The new standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and, upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for all leases with terms in excess of twelve months. The new guidance also modifies the classification criteria and accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases, and requires additional disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Consistent with current guidance, a lessee s recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will continue to depend primarily on its classification. The accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and must be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Stock Compensation     Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The accounting standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses  . The standard changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The Company will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities rather than deductions in amortized cost. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows  . The standard clarifies the way certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for all periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
   
  3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  
  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
  Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  
  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
  The categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
  The Company classifies its cash equivalents and marketable investments within Level 1 and Level 2, as it uses quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.  
  The Company determined the fair value of its Level 1 financial instruments, which are traded in active markets, using quoted market prices for identical instruments.  
  Marketable investments classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on other observable inputs, including broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources. When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available, the Company relies on non-binding quotes from its investment managers, which are based on proprietary valuation models of independent pricing services. These models generally use inputs such as observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, historical pricing trends of a security relative to its peers and internal assumptions of the independent pricing services. To validate the fair value determination provided by its investment managers, the Company reviews the pricing movement in the context of overall market trends and trading information from its investment managers. In addition, the Company assesses the inputs and methods used in determining the fair value in order to determine the classification of securities in the fair value hierarchy.  
  The Company did not own any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did not record impairment charges related to its marketable investments, and the Company did not have any transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The Company did not have any financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

5. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Lease Commitments 
  The Company leases its offices and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates from 2029 to 2031. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.4 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.8 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively. In addition, the Company's lease commitments also require it to make additional payments during the lease term for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. 
  Royalty Obligations 
  In March 2005, the Company entered into a license agreement that requires the Company to make minimum royalty payments to the licensor on a quarterly basis. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the license agreement required minimum annual royalty payments of   $0.1 million   in equal quarterly installments. On each January 1, the quarterly calendar year minimum royalty will be adjusted to equal the prior year s minimum royalty adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the  consumer price index for all urban consumers  for the prior calendar year as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor. Unless terminated earlier, the term of the license agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent that covers that licensed product or 2022, whichever is longer.  
  In April 2012, the Company entered into an agreement that requires the Company to pay, on a quarterly basis, a   5%   royalty on sales of products covered under applicable patents. Unless the agreement is terminated earlier, the royalty term for each applicable product will continue until the expirations of the applicable patent covering such product or 2029, whichever is longer. 
  In November 2013, the Company entered into an agreement that requires the Company to pay, on a quarterly basis, a   3%   royalty on the first   $5 million   in sales and a   1%   royalty on sales thereafter of products covered under applicable patents. Unless the agreement is terminated earlier, the royalty for each covered product shall continue until 2030. 
  In April 2015, the Company entered into a royalty agreement that requires the Company to pay, on a quarterly basis, a   2%   royalty on sales of certain products covered by the agreement. Unless the royalty agreement is terminated earlier, the royalty term for each covered product shall continue until 2035. 
  Royalty expense included in cost of sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.7 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2.1 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively.  
  Contingencies 
  From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.  
  Indemnification  
  The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. In many such arrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to the Company s technology. The term of these indemnification agreements

is generally perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made.  
  The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the individual.  
  The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. 
  No liability associated with any of these indemnification requirements has been recorded to date. 
  Litigation  
  The Company was contacted in 2015 by the attorney for a potential product liability claimant who allegedly suffered injuries as a result of an aneurysm procedure in which the Penumbra Coil 400 was used. On February 19, 2016, a complaint for damages was filed on behalf of this claimant against the Company and the hospital involved in the procedure   (  Montgomery v. Penumbra, Inc., et al.,   Case No. 16-2-04050-1 SEA, Superior Court of the State of Washington, King County)  . The suit alleges liability primarily under the Washington Product Liability Act and seeks both compensatory and punitive damages without a specific damages claim. Counsel for the claimant previously indicated that he expects that a jury could award   $35 million   in damages were this matter to go to trial. This amount is substantially in excess of the Company s insurance coverage.   The hospital defendant had requested indemnification from the Company but was dismissed from the case in July 2016. The case is in the   discovery phase, and the Company is unable to assess the merits of the plaintiff s case. The Company intends to vigorously defend the litigation, as the Company believes there will be substantial questions regarding causation, liability and damages. 
  From time to time, the Company is subject to claims and assessments in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any litigation matter that, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  Under the Penumbra, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ), employees purchased   148,354   shares for   $3.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Stock-based Compensation 
  The following table sets forth the stock-based compensation expense included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation cost was   $35.1 million   related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.9   years. 
  The total stock-based compensation cost capitalized in inventory was   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  

7. Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income 
  Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of two components: unrealized gains or losses on the Company s available-for-sale marketable investments, and gains or losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. Until realized and reported as a component of net income, these comprehensive income items accumulate and are included within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company s marketable investments are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into earnings when realized upon sale, and are determined based on specific identification of securities sold. Gains and losses from the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.

The following table summarizes the changes in the accumulated balances during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and includes information regarding the manner in which the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into earnings affect the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income (in thousands): 

8. Income Taxes  
  The Company s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. 
  During interim periods, the Company generally utilizes the estimated annual effective tax rate method which involves the use of forecasted information.  Under this method, the provision is calculated by applying   an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  ordinary  income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period  .   Although management believes the use of the annual effective tax rate method to be appropriate for prior interim reporting periods, for the fiscal three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively  , the Company used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate taxes.   The discrete method of calculating the estimated effective tax rate involves the use of actual year-to-date information. The Company determined that  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  
  Penumbra, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

since small changes in estimated  ordinary  income would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the discrete effective tax rate method would provide a more reliable estimate in income tax expense for both periods. 
  The Company s effective tax rate decreased to   (1.3)%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   56.8%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit as a result of a domestic operating loss offset by an income tax expense from discrete items recorded for the three month period. 
  The effective tax rate increased to   121.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   65.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The increase in rate was primarily attributable to a shift in the ratio of operating income between jurisdictions for the nine month period. 
   
  9. Net (Loss) Income per Share of Common Stock attributable to Common Stockholders  
  The Company calculated its basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Under the two-class method, the Company determined whether it had net income attributable to common stockholders, which included the results of operations less current period preferred stock non-cumulative dividends. If it was determined that the Company did have net income attributable to common stockholders during a period, the related undistributed earnings were then allocated between common stock and the preferred stock based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period to determine the numerator for the basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders. In computing diluted net income attributable to common stockholders, undistributed earnings were re-allocated to reflect the potential impact of dilutive securities to determine the numerator for the diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders.  
  The Company s basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock and common stock warrants are considered common stock equivalents.

  Overview 
  Penumbra, Inc. ( we,   our,   us,   Penumbra,  and the  Company ) is a global interventional therapies company that designs, develops, manufactures and markets innovative medical devices. We have a broad portfolio of products that addresses challenging medical conditions and significant clinical needs across two major markets, neuro and peripheral vascular. The conditions that our products address include, among others, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and various peripheral vascular conditions that can be treated through thrombectomy and embolization procedures. 
  We are an established company focused on the neuro and peripheral vascular markets. We sell our products to hospitals, primarily through our salesforce, as well as through distributors in select international markets. We focus on developing, manufacturing and marketing products for use by specialist physicians, including interventional neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, interventional neurologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. We design our products to provide these specialist physicians with a means to drive improved clinical outcomes through faster and safer procedures. 
  Since our founding in 2004, we have invested heavily in our product development capabilities in our two key markets: neuro and peripheral vascular. We launched our first neurovascular product in 2007, our first peripheral vascular product in 2013 and our first neurosurgical product in 2014. To date, we have launched 16 product brands, and we expect to continue to develop and build our portfolio of products based on our thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies. Generally, when we introduce a next generation product or a new product designed to replace a current product, sales of the earlier generation product or the product replaced decline. Our research and development activities are centered around the development of new products and clinical activities designed to support our regulatory submissions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our products. 
  We manufacture substantially all of our products at our campus in Alameda, California, and stock inventory of raw materials, components and finished goods primarily at that location. We rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components, and we generally have no long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers, as we order on a purchase order basis. We ship all of our products to our hospital customers and distributors worldwide pursuant to purchase orders. We typically recognize revenue when products are delivered to our hospital customers or distributors, other than our coils, which we ship to our hospital customers on a consignment basis, and for which we recognize revenue when the hospital customers utilize products in a procedure. 
  Hospitals purchase our products for use in procedures performed by their specialist physicians, generally seeking reimbursement from third party payors for procedures performed. We believe that the cost-effectiveness of our products is attractive to our hospital customers. 
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   33.0%   and   32.1%   of our revenue, respectively, was generated from customers located outside of the United States.  A significant amount of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in the Euro and Japanese Yen, with some sales being denominated in British Pounds, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. As a result, we have foreign exchange exposure, but do not currently engage in hedging. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , no single hospital and only one distributor accounted for more than   10%   of our sales.

     Table of Contents  

We sell our products to hospitals primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as through distributors in select international markets. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated revenue of   $190.2 million   as compared to   $131.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which represents an increase of   44.5%  , and in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated a   $0.2 million   operating loss as compared to operating income of   $2.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which represents a decrease of   108.4%  .  
  Factors Affecting Our Performance  
  There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. For example:    
             
    The rate at which we grow our salesforce and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become fully effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. 
                
    Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a number of large, well-capitalized companies. We must continue to successfully compete in light of our competitors  existing and future products and their resources to successfully market to the specialist physicians who use our products. 
                
    We must continue to successfully introduce new products that gain acceptance with specialist physicians and successfully transition from existing products to new products, ensuring adequate supply while avoiding excess inventory of older products and resulting inventory write-downs or write-offs. In addition, as we introduce new products, we generally hire and train additional personnel and build our inventory of components and finished goods in advance of sales, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our financial condition. 
                
    Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, our products are used by specialist physicians and the procedures and treatments those physicians choose to administer for a given condition. 
                
    The specialist physicians who use our products may not perform procedures during certain times of the year, such as those periods when they are at major medical conferences or are away from their practices for other reasons, the timing of which occurs irregularly during the year and from year to year. 
     In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our quarterly revenue, gross profit and gross margin as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the number of available selling days, which can be impacted by holidays; the mix of products sold; the geographic mix of where products are sold; the demand for our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for products; increased competition; the timing of customer orders; inventory write-offs and write-downs; costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions; the availability and cost of components and raw materials; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We experience quarters in which we have significant revenue growth sequentially followed by quarters of moderate or no revenue growth. Additionally, we experience quarters in which operating expenses, in particular research and development expenses, fluctuate depending on the stage and timing of product development. 
   
  Components of Results of Operations 
  Revenue.   We sell our products directly to hospitals and through distributors for use in procedures performed by specialist physicians to treat patients in two key markets: neuro and peripheral vascular disease. We sell our products through purchase orders, and we do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers. We typically recognize revenue when products are delivered to our hospital customers or distributors. However, with respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. Revenue also includes shipping and handling costs that we charge to customers. 
  Cost of Revenue.   Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, inbound freight charges, receiving costs, inspection and testing costs, warehousing costs, royalty expense, shipping and handling costs and other labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products. We manufacture substantially all of our products in our manufacturing facility at our campus in Alameda, California. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Research and Development (R D).   R D expenses primarily consist of product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with the development of our products. R D expenses also include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants. We expense R D costs as they are incurred. 
  We expect our R D expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as we innovate and develop new products, add personnel and engage in ongoing clinical research.  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Sales, General and Administrative (SG A).   SG A expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants engaged in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, facilities and information technology, medical education and training and human resource activities. Our SG A expenses also include commissions, generally based on a percentage of sales, to direct sales representatives and the medical device excise tax, which was approximately 2.3% of U.S. sales in 2015. The medical device excise tax has been suspended for a two-year period commencing January 1, 2016; however, it could be reinstated. 
  We expect our SG A expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as we expand our salesforce, marketing programs and operations, including those related to operating as a public company.   
  Income Tax Expense.   We are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the potential valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. 
  Results of Operations 
  The following table sets forth the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue 

Revenue   increased     $16.8 million  , or   33.3%  , to   $67.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $50.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our revenue growth resulted from further market penetration of our existing products and sales of new products or products with new indications. Increased sales within our neuro and peripheral vascular businesses accounted for approximately two thirds and one third of the revenue increase, respectively, in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

Revenue from sales in the U.S.   increased     $9.0 million  , or   25.4%  , to   $44.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $35.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenue from sales in international markets   increased     $7.8 million  , or   51.8%  , to   $22.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $15.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenue from international sales represented   33.9%   and   29.8%   of our total revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Revenue from our neuro products   increased     $11.2 million  , or   30.9%  , to   $47.5 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $36.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our neuro product sales experienced strong momentum due to further market penetration and growth in the market following the presentation and publication of MR. CLEAN trial results in the fourth quarter of 2014, which support endovascular treatment of stroke. We believe that these and other published trial results have led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products. Increased sales of Penumbra System products accounted for slightly less than half of the neuro revenue increase in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Further, increased sales of our neuro embolization products accounted for approximately 40% of the neuro revenue increase period over period. This increase was due to greater demand for our neuro coil products, which can fluctuate from period to period due to the number of procedures performed in a given period using our products. Prices for our neuro products remained substantially unchanged during the period. 
  Revenue from our peripheral vascular products   increased     $5.5 million  , or   39.3%  , to   $19.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $14.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our peripheral embolization and peripheral thrombectomy products experienced strong volume growth in the period due to increases in the number of procedures, primarily due to the focused efforts of our dedicated peripheral vascular salesforce, which was established in the second half of 2014, and further market penetration of our products. Increased sales of Indigo System products accounted for slightly less than 40% of the peripheral vascular revenue increase in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Prices for our peripheral vascular products remained substantially unchanged during the period. 
  Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

Gross profit   increased     $9.4 million  , or   28.0%  , to   $42.9 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $33.5 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sales of our neuro and peripheral vascular products.     
  Gross margin   decreased     2.6   percentage points to   63.8%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   66.4%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in gross margin was due to new product launches, additional costs associated with hiring and training additional personnel and geographic and product mix. 
  Research and Development (R D) 

R D expenses   increased   by   $1.9 million  , or   42.5%  , to   $6.5 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $4.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount and a $0.5 million increase in product development, testing and clinical trial costs. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

Sales, General and Administrative (SG A) 

SG A expenses   increased   by   $11.0 million  , or   41.1%  , to   $37.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $26.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $7.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 59% increase in headcount as a result of additional personnel to support our growth and a $0.8 million increase due to marketing events.  
  Provision for Income Taxes    

During interim periods, the Company generally utilizes the estimated annual effective tax rate method which involves the use of forecasted information.   Under this method, the provision is calculated by applying   an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  ordinary  income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period  .   The discrete method of calculating the estimated effective tax rate involves the use of actual year-to-date information. The Company applied the discrete effective tax rate method for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company determined that since small changes in estimated  ordinary  income would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the discrete effective tax rate method would provide a more reliable estimate in income tax expense for both periods. 
  Our provision for our income taxes   decreased     $1.2 million  , to   $14,000   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our   effective tax rate decreased to   (1.3)%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   56.8%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit as a result of our domestic operating loss offset by an income tax expense from discrete items recorded for the three month period. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue 

Revenue   increased     $58.5 million  , or   44.5%  , to   $190.2 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $131.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our revenue growth resulted from further market penetration of our existing products and sales of new products or products with new indications. Increased sales within our neuro business accounted for slightly more than half of the revenue increase in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Revenue from sales in the U.S.   increased     $38.1 million  , or   42.7%  , to   $127.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $89.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenue from sales in international markets   increased     $20.4 million  , or   48.2%  , to   $62.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $42.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenue from international sales represented   33.0%   and   32.1%   of our total revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Revenue from our neuro products   increased     $31.8 million  , or   31.1%  , to   $134.2 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $102.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our neuro product sales experienced strong momentum due to further market penetration and growth in the market following the presentation and publication of

MR. CLEAN trial results in the fourth quarter of 2014, which support endovascular treatment of stroke. We believe that these and other published trial results have led to increases in the number of procedures performed by specialist physicians using our products. Increased sales of Penumbra System products accounted for slightly more than half of the neuro revenue increase in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Further, increased sales of our neuro embolization products accounted for approximately 30% of the neuro revenue increase period over period. This increase was due to greater demand for our neuro coil products, which can fluctuate from period to period due to the number of procedures performed in a given period using our products. Prices for our neuro products remained substantially unchanged during the period. 
  Revenue from our peripheral vascular products   increased     $26.7 million  , or   91.1%  , to   $56.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $29.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our peripheral embolization and peripheral thrombectomy products experienced strong volume growth in the period due to increases in the number of procedures, the focused efforts of our dedicated peripheral vascular salesforce, which was established in the second half of 2014, and further market penetration of our products. Increased sales of Indigo System products accounted for approximately 60% of the peripheral vascular revenue increase in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Prices for our peripheral vascular products remained substantially unchanged during the period. 
  Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

Gross profit   increased     $36.6 million  , or   41.8%  , to   $124.2 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $87.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sales of our neuro and peripheral vascular products. 
  Gross margin   decreased     1.2   percentage points to   65.3%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   66.5%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in gross margin was due to new product launches, additional costs associated with hiring and training additional personnel and geographic and product mix. 
  Research and Development (R D) 

R D expenses   increased   by   $5.2 million  , or   41.6%  , to   $17.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $12.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount, a $1.2 million increase in consultant and contractor expenses and a $0.9 million increase in facilities and information technology expenses. 
  Sales, General and Administrative (SG A) 

SG A expenses   increased   by   $34.0 million  , or   46.8%  , to   $106.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $72.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $20.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 59% increase in headcount as a result of additional personnel to support our growth, a $2.2 million increase in facilities and information technology expenses, a $2.2 million increase in travel-related expenses and a $2.0 million increase due to marketing events.

Provision for Income Taxes    

During interim periods, the Company generally utilizes the estimated annual effective tax rate method which involves the use of forecasted information.   Under this method, the provision is calculated by applying   an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  ordinary  income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period  .   The discrete method of calculating the estimated effective tax rate involves the use of actual year-to-date information. The Company applied the discrete effective tax rate method for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company determined that since small changes in estimated  ordinary  income would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the discrete effective tax rate method would provide a more reliable estimate in income tax expense for both periods 
  Our provision from income taxes   decreased     $0.6 million  , to   $0.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our   effective tax rate increased to   121.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   65.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The increase in rate was primarily attributable to a shift in the ratio of operating income between jurisdictions. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $229.9 million   in working capital, which included   $15.9 million   in cash and cash equivalents and   $126.0 million   in marketable investments.  
  In addition to our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment balances, our principal source of liquidity is our accounts receivable. We believe these sources will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our principal liquidity requirements are to fund our operations, including our research and development, and capital expenditures. To facilitate our growth, we may also lease or purchase additional facilities. We expect to continue to make investments as we launch new products, expand our manufacturing operations and further expand into international markets. We may, however, require or elect to secure additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy. If we require or elect to raise additional funds, we may do so through equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, could result in dilution to our stockholders and could require us to agree to covenants that limit our operating flexibility.

    Working capital consists of total current assets less total current liabilities.          
     The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents, net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash and cash equivalents:

     Table of Contents  

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  
  Net cash used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization, inventory write downs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of premium on marketable investments, provision for doubtful accounts, provision for sales returns, loss on disposal of property and equipment, provision for product warranty), and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. 
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $10.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and consisted of net loss of   $0.1 million   and non-cash items of   $7.0 million   offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $16.9 million  . The change in operating assets and liabilities include the increase in inventories of   $14.0 million   to support our revenue growth, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets of   $5.5 million   and an increase in accounts receivable of   $7.1 million  , partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities of   $8.8 million   and accounts payable of   $0.9 million  , as a result of the growth in our business activities. 
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $12.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and consisted of net income of   $0.7 million   and non-cash items of   $6.3 million   offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $19.7 million  . The change in operating assets and liabilities include the increase in inventories of   $18.0 million   to support our revenue growth, an increase in accounts receivable of   $7.4 million  , an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and non-current assets of   $1.7 million  , partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities of   $5.9 million   and accounts payable of   $1.5 million  , as a result of the growth in our business activities. 
  Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities  
  Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities relates primarily to proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable investments, offset by purchases of marketable investments and capital expenditures. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $3.5 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and consisted of capital expenditures of   $7.1 million  , partially offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable investments of   $3.6 million  . 
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $43.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and consisted of the net proceeds from sales of marketable investments of   $48.1 million   partially offset by capital expenditures of   $4.5 million  . 
  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  
  Net cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to stock option exercises, issuance of stock under our ESPP and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. 
  Financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   provided net cash of   $12.3 million   due to excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation of   $7.6 million  , proceeds from exercises of stock options of   $2.9 million  , and proceeds from issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan of   $3.8 million  , partially offset by payment of employee taxes related to vested restricted stock of   $2.0 million  . 
  Financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   provided cash of   $125.2 million   and consisted of net proceeds from our IPO of   $125.9 million  , net of issuance costs, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation of   $1.3 million   and proceeds from exercises of stock options of   $0.5 million  , partially offset by payment of employee taxes related to vested common and restricted stock of   $2.5 million  . 
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  Our contractual obligations and commitments as of   September 30, 2016   have not materially changed from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any holdings in variable interest entities. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  We have prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
  For information with respect to recently issued accounting standards and the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
  We are exposed to various market risks, which may result in potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not believe we are exposed to material market risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents and/or our marketable investments. 
  Interest Rate Risk.   We had cash and cash equivalents of   $15.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which consisted of funds held in general checking and savings accounts. In addition, we had marketable investments of   $126.0 million  , which consisted primarily of corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, commercial paper and U.S. Treasury. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the U.S. government. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy.  A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash and cash equivalents or marketable investments. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk Management.   We operate in countries other than the U.S., and, therefore, we are exposed to foreign currency risks. We bill most sales outside of the U.S. in local currencies, primarily the Euro and Japanese Yen, with some sales being denominated in British Pounds, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. We expect that the percentage of our sales denominated in foreign currencies may increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to expand into international markets. When sales or expenses are not denominated in U.S. Dollars, a fluctuation in exchange rates could affect our net (loss) income. We do not believe an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have a material effect on our results of operations. We do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, we may choose to hedge our exposure in the future. 
  We do not believe that inflation and changes in prices had a significant impact on our results of operations for any periods presented on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  
  We were contacted in 2015 by the attorney for a potential product liability claimant who allegedly suffered injuries as a result of an aneurysm procedure in which the Penumbra Coil 400 was used. On February 19, 2016, a complaint for damages was filed on behalf of this claimant against the Company and the hospital involved in the procedure   (  Montgomery v. Penumbra, Inc., et al.,   Case No. 16-2-04050-1 SEA, Superior Court of the State of Washington, King County)  . The suit alleges liability primarily under the Washington Product Liability Act and seeks both compensatory and punitive damages without a specific damages claim. Counsel for the claimant previously indicated that he expects that a jury could award   $35 million   in damages were this matter to go to trial. This amount is substantially in excess of our insurance coverage.   The hospital defendant had requested indemnification from the Company, but was dismissed from the case in July 2016.  The case is in the discovery phase, and   we are unable to assess the merits of the plaintiff s case. We intend to vigorously defend the litigation, as we believe there will be substantial questions regarding causation, liability and damages. 
  From time to time, we are subject to claims and assessments in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation matter that, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  
  There have been no material changes to our risk factors reported or new factors identified since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on March 8, 2016.

There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering from that described in the prospectus dated September 17, 2015 filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act. Pending the planned use of proceeds, we have invested the funds received from our initial public offering in marketable investments.
