  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  Maxim Integrated ) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature which were considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data were derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  .  
    
  The Company has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 was a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2017 will also be a 52-week fiscal year. 

NOTE 2: RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  (i) New Accounting Updates Recently Adopted 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. As a result of the adoption, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 the Company recorded a   $1.4 million   cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for the recognition of excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards in prior periods and a discrete income tax benefit of   $3.3 million   to the income tax provision for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, of share-based awards. The adoption also resulted in an increase in cash flow from operating activities and a decrease in cash flow from financing activities of   $3.3 million   in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior periods. 
    
  (ii) Recent Accounting Updates Not Yet Effective 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .   This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU No. 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU No. 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU No. 2014-09. Early adoption in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its financial position and results of operations, as well as its selected transition method.  
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value.  ASU No. 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will result in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. This ASU will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The application of this ASU will be by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effects of the adoption of this ASU to its financial statements. 
  
    8 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. This guidance is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its financial statements. 

NOTE 3: BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS 
    
  Inventories consist of: 

Property, plant and equipment, net consists of:

NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The FASB established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: 
    
  Level 1   - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company s Level 1 assets consist of money market funds. 
    
  Level 2   - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  
    
  The Company s Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. treasury bills, certificates of deposit and foreign currency forward contracts that are valued using quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates. As a result, the Company has classified these investments as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Also within Level 2 assets and liabilities are shares of common stock received as consideration for the sale of the Company's wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas, which have been valued based on quoted prices in the active market for identical assets, adjusted for estimated timing of sale. 
    
  Level 3   - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company did not hold any Level 3 assets or liabilities as of   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016  . 
    
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

(1) Included in Cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  (2) Included in Short-term investments in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  (3) Included in Other current assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  (4) Included in Accrued expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016  , there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy. 
  
    10 

There were   no   assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016   other than impairments of Long-Lived assets. For details, please refer to Note 14:  Impairment of long-lived assets .  

NOTE 5: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Short-term investments 
  Fair values were as follows: 

In the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and the year ended   June 25, 2016  , the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on short-term investments. The U.S. Treasury bills have maturity dates between December 15, 2017 and December 15, 2018. 
    
  Securities received as consideration for sale of assets 
    
  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company received approximately   $40.0 million   in common shares of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. as consideration for the sale of the Company's semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas. During the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company sold some of these common shares for gross proceeds of approximately   $24.5 million  . The remaining common shares were valued at approximately   $25.9 million   as of   September 24, 2016  , with the increase in value of   $5.4 million   treated as an unrealized gain. The Company is required to return to Tower Semiconductor the first   $6.0 million   in gain realized upon the sale of such shares. 
    
  Derivative instruments and hedging activities 
    
  The Company incurs expenditures denominated in non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Philippine Peso and the Thai Baht associated with the Company's manufacturing activities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively, and European Union Euro and South Korean Won expenditures for sales offices and research and development activities undertaken outside of the U.S. 
    
  The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. The Company does not use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes. 
    
  Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments  
    
  The Company designates certain forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 815-Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ). As of   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016  , the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were   $55.4 million   and   $68.0 million  , respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were   $2.3 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively.  
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
    
  As of   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016  , the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were   $25.8 million   and   $25.4 million  , respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were   $17.0 million   and   $24.6 million  , respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and gain (loss) included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income were not material for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and the year ended   June 25, 2016  .  
  
    11 

Long-term debt 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s long-term debt: 

On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company s   2.5%   coupon senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in November 2018 ( 2018 Notes ), with an effective interest rate of   2.6%  . Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately   $494.5 million  , after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. 
    
  On March 18, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company s   3.375%   senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in March 2023 ( 2023 Notes ), with an effective interest rate of   3.5%  . Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately   $490.0 million  , after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. 
    
  The debt indentures that govern the 2023 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2023 Notes or the 2018 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
    
  The Company accounts for all the notes above based on their amortized cost. The discount and expenses are being amortized to Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the notes. The interest expense is recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes was   $9.1 million   and   $7.3 million   during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt was approximately   $1,028 million   as of   September 24, 2016  . The estimated fair value of the debt is based primarily on observable market inputs and is a Level 2 measurement. 
    
  The Company recorded interest expense of   $9.8 million   and   $8.2 million   during the three months ended   September 24, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Credit Facility 
  Revolving credit facility 
    
  The Company has access to a   $350 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on June 27, 2019. The facility fee is at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company s index debt rating and any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Company s index debt rating. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than   3     to   1   and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than   3.5   to   1  . As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants. 

12 

Short-term credit agreement 
    
  On June 23, 2016, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a short-term credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the  Lender ), in order to facilitate the return of capital to the Company. The Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, the Lender making an unsecured term loan in an amount equal to   $250.0 million   with a maturity date of June 22, 2017. The net proceeds of this credit agreement were approximately   $249.7 million  , after deducting paid issuance costs. The interest rate on the note is based on LIBOR plus a margin. The initial interest rate is   1.69%   per annum and will be adjusted quarterly. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than   3     to   1   and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than   3.5   to   1  . As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants. Fair value approximates the carrying value, given the short-term nature of the loan. 
    
  Other Financial Instruments 
  For the balance of the Company s financial instruments, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.  

NOTE 6: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  At   September 24, 2016  , the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the  1996 Plan ) and one employee stock purchase plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  2008 ESPP ). The 1996 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors to provide the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), and market stock units ( MSUs ) to employees, directors, and consultants.  
    
  Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than ten years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service.  
    
  RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. 
    
  MSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a two to four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period.  The number of shares that are released at the end of the performance period can range from zero to a maximum cap depending on the Company's performance. The performance metrics of this program are based on relative performance of the Company s stock price as compared to the Semiconductor Exchange Traded Fund index XSD (the  SPDR S P ). 

13 

The following tables show total stock-based compensation expense by type of award, and the resulting tax effect, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively:  

The expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to RSUs include expenses related to MSUs of   $0.6 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  The fair value of options granted to employees under the 1996 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.  
    
  Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatilities from the Company s traded common stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company is utilizing the simplified method to estimate expected holding periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield. The Company determines the dividend yield by dividing the annualized dividends per share by the prior quarter s average stock price. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.  
    
  There were   no   stock options granted in the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  .  
    
  The following table summarizes outstanding, exercisable and vested and expected to vest stock options as of   September 24, 2016   and their activity for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on September 23, 2016, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of options outstanding, exercisable or vested and expected to vest as of September 24, 2016. 

14 

As of   September 24, 2016  , there was   $4.9 million   of total unrecognized stock compensation cost related to   2.1 million   unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.1   years. 
    
  Restricted Stock Units and Other Awards 
    
  The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis.  
    
  The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was   $35.97   and   $28.28   per share for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The following table summarizes the outstanding and expected to vest RSUs and other awards as of   September 24, 2016   and their activity during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Aggregate intrinsic value for RSUs and other awards represents the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on September 23, 2016, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of RSUs outstanding or expected to vest as of September 24, 2016.  

The Company withheld shares totaling   $5.2 million   in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  . The total payments for the employees  tax obligations to the taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
    
  As of   September 24, 2016  , there was   $169.0 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to   7.5 million   unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   3.0   years.  
    
  Market Stock Units 
    
  The Company granted MSUs to senior members of management in September 2015 and September 2016. The grant of MSUs was in lieu of granting stock options. MSUs are valued based on the relative performance of the Company s stock price as compared to the Semiconductor Exchange Traded Fund index XSD (the  SPDR S P ). The fair value of MSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. Compensation expense is recognized based on the initial valuation and is not subsequently adjusted as a result of the Company s performance relative to that of the XSD index. Vesting for MSUs is contingent upon both service and market conditions, and has a four-year vesting cliff period. 
    
  The weighted-average fair value of MSUs granted was   $37.29   and   $29.64   per share for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  

15 

The following table summarizes the number of MSUs outstanding and expected to vest as of   September 24, 2016   and their activity during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Aggregate intrinsic value for MSUs represents the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on September 23, 2016, the last business day preceding the fiscal quarter-end, multiplied by the number of MSUs outstanding or expected to vest as of September 24, 2016.  

As of   September 24, 2016  , there was   $21.3 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to   0.9 million   unvested MSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   3.3   years.  
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  Employees are granted rights to acquire common stock under the 2008 ESPP. 
    
  The fair value of ESPP rights granted to employees has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the following assumptions for the offering periods outstanding: 

As of   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , there was   $3.1 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP. 

NOTE 7: EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing basic earnings (loss) per share, the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock excludes unvested RSUs and MSUs. Diluted earnings (loss) per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, assumed release of unvested RSUs, Performance Shares, MSUs and assumed issuance of common stock under the 2008 ESPP using the treasury stock method. 

16 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: 

The Company had a net loss for the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , accordingly all incremental shares totaling   5.7 million   shares were determined to be anti-dilutive. 
    
  For the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  ,   no   securities were determined to be anti-dilutive     and therefore none were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 

NOTE 8: SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed signal integrated circuits. All of the Company's products are designed through a centralized R D function, manufactured using centralized manufacturing (internal and external), and sold through a centralized sales force and shared wholesale distributors. 
   The Company currently has   one   operating segment. In accordance with ASC No. 280,   Segment Reporting   ( ASC 280 ), the Company considers operating segments to be components of the Company s business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Company was assessed and determined to be the CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single operating and reportable segment. 
    
  Enterprise-wide information is provided in accordance with ASC 280. Geographical revenue information is based on customers  ship-to location. Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment information is based on the physical location of the assets at the end of each fiscal year. 
    
  Net revenues from unaffiliated customers by geographic region were as follows:

NOTE 9: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
    
  The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component and related tax effects in the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows: 

18 

NOTE 10: INCOME TAXES  
    
  In the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , the Company recorded an income tax provision (benefit) of   $27.6 million   and   $(10.0) million  , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   16.7%   and   12.2%  , respectively. 
    
  The Company s federal statutory tax rate is   35%  . The Company s effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates and a   $3.3 million   discrete benefit for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected. 
    
  The Company's effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015   was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower tax rates, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected. 
    
  The Company s federal corporate income tax returns are audited on a recurring basis by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). The IRS has concluded its field examination of the Company s federal corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 ( Audit Years ) and issued a IRS Revenue Agent s Report ( RAR ) in July 2016 that includes proposed adjustments for transfer pricing issues related to cost sharing and buy-in license payments for the use of intangible property by one of the Company s international subsidiaries.  The Company disagrees with the proposed transfer pricing adjustments and related penalties and in September 2016 filed a protest to challenge the proposed adjustments and request a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS. The Company believes that its reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover any potential assessments that may result from the final resolution of these transfer pricing issues.   

NOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is party or subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to intellectual property matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized or reserved, if any.  
    
  Indemnification 
    
  The Company indemnifies certain customers, distributors, suppliers and subcontractors for attorney fees, damages and costs awarded against such parties in certain circumstances in which the Company's products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including patents, registered trademarks or copyrights.

  The changes in the Company s aggregate product warranty liabilities for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows: 

NOTE 12: COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES 
    
  In July 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to   $1 billion   of the Company s common stock from time to time at the discretion of the Company s management. This stock repurchase authorization has no expiration date. All prior authorizations by the Company s Board of Directors for the repurchase of common stock were superseded by this authorization.  
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company repurchased approximately   1.5 million   shares of its common stock for   $57.7 million  . As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had remaining authorization of   $272.0 million   for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company s common stock and general market and business conditions.

  Goodwill 
    
  The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
    
  Fiscal Year 2017 
    
  No indicators or instances of impairment were identified in the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  .  
    
  Fiscal Year 2016 
    
  The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. No indicators or instances of impairment were identified during fiscal year   2016  . 
    
  During the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  ,   $20.4 million   of goodwill from the Micros and Security reporting unit was included in the sale of the energy metering business to Silergy Corp.

NOTE 14: IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
    
  Fiscal year 2017: 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company recorded   $6.1 million   in impairment of long-lived assets in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income primarily associated with certain investments in privately held companies. The Company reached its conclusion regarding the asset impairment after the determination was made that due to factors during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the financial condition of the privately held companies indicated an other than temporary impairment. 
    
  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company classified the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line, including associated tangible assets and goodwill, as held for sale but no impairment charge was recorded as the carrying value of the product lines' associated assets approximated or was less than the fair value, less cost to sell. The fair values of the assets were determined after consideration of quoted market prices of similar equipment and offers received. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company completed the sale of this business line for approximately   $42.2 million  , resulting in a gain of   $26.6 million  , included in Other operating income (expenses), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Fiscal year 2016: 
    
  During the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  , the Company recorded   $160.6 million   in impairment of long-lived assets in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company recorded a   $157.7 million   impairment of long-lived assets associated with the Company's wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas which was classified as held for sale and written down to fair value, less cost to sell. The Company reached its conclusion regarding the asset impairment after conducting an evaluation of assets' fair values. The fair value of the land, buildings and equipment was determined after consideration of expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets and outside appraisals. The Company signed an agreement with TowerJazz Texas, Inc. (formerly known as TJ Texas, Inc.), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. ("TowerJazz"), for the sale of the semiconductor wafer fabrication facility in San Antonio, Texas on November 18, 2015. During the third quarter of  
  
    22 

fiscal year 2016, the Company completed the sale of this facility for approximately   $30.0 million   in common shares of TowerJazz, resulting in a loss of   $1.6 million   included in Other operating income (expenses), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, approximately   $10.0 million   in common shares of TowerJazz was received for the sale of the inventory on hand associated with this facility.  
    
  In addition, the San Jose wafer fabrication facility was classified as held for sale during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but no impairment charge was recorded as the carrying value of the associated assets approximated the fair value, less cost to sell. The fair value of the land, buildings and equipment was determined after consideration of outside appraisals, quoted market prices of similar equipment and offers received. The Company completed the sale of this facility in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 for approximately   $39.0 million   resulting in a gain of   $3.8 million   included in Other operating income (expenses), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company classified the energy metering business, including associated tangible, intangible assets and goodwill, as held for sale but no impairment charge was recorded as the carrying value of the product lines' associated assets approximated or was less than the fair value, less cost to sell. The fair values of the assets were determined after consideration of offers received. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company completed the sale of this product line for approximately   $105.0 million  , resulting in a gain of   $58.9 million   included in Other operating income (expenses), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

NOTE 15: RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES 
    
  Fiscal year 2017: 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company recorded   $10.0 million   in  Severance and restructuring expenses  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income related to various restructuring plans designed to reduce costs. These charges were associated with continued reorganization of certain business units and functions and the planned closure of the Dallas wafer level packaging ( WLP ) manufacturing facilities. Multiple job classifications and locations were impacted by these activities.  
    
  As the Company plans to close its Dallas, Texas campus, including its WLP manufacturing facility in fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation charges of   $1.6 million   during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company expects to incur future restructuring costs of   $2.7 million   related to these restructuring plans. 
    
  Fiscal year 2016: 
    
  San Jose Fab Shutdown 
    
  In October 2014, the Company initiated a plan to shut down its San Jose wafer fabrication facility. The Company reached the decision that it was not economically feasible to maintain this facility, which was used primarily for fab process development and low volume manufacturing, as the Company intended to utilize other resources to complete such activities in the future. This plan included cash charges related to employee severance and non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation. This plan has been completed, and the shutdown took place in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
    
  During the fiscal year ending   June 25, 2016  , the Company recorded accelerated depreciation charges of   $41.6 million  , in  Cost of goods sold  and   $0.4 million   in  Severance and restructuring expenses  in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The sale of the San Jose wafer fabrication facility took place during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The cumulative costs recorded in fiscal year 2015 and 2016 to complete this restructuring plan were   $100.3 million   and no future restructuring costs associated with this plan is expected. 
    
  Other Plans 
    
  During the fiscal year ending   June 25, 2016  , the Company recorded   $24.0 million   in  Severance and restructuring expenses  in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to various restructuring plans designed to reduce costs. These charges were associated with continued reorganization of certain business units and functions and the planned closure of the Dallas wafer level packaging ( WLP ) manufacturing facilities. Multiple job classifications and locations were impacted by these activities.  
    
  As the Company plans to close its Dallas, Texas campus, including its WLP manufacturing facility in fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation charges of   $13.0 million   during the fiscal year ending   June 25, 2016  . 
  
    23 

Restructuring Accruals 
    
  The Company has accruals for severance and restructuring payments within Accrued salary and related expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table summarizes changes in the accruals associated with these restructuring activities during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  : 

(1)  
    Charges and change in estimates are included in Severance and restructuring expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
       
  Change in estimate: 
    
  Due to the above mentioned restructuring activities, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation resulting from the change in estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets included in restructuring plans. In all periods that accelerated depreciation expense was recorded, this resulted in additional expense and therefore impacted operating income (loss), net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share as presented in the table below.

except as required by federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers should carefully review future reports and documents that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, such as its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K. 
    
  Overview of Business 
    
  Maxim Integrated is incorporated in the state of Delaware. Maxim Integrated designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of geographically diverse customers. We also provide a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities that can be used in custom designs. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by many diverse applications, a great number of product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. We are a global company with wafer manufacturing facilities in the U.S., testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand and sales and circuit design offices around the world. The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.  
    
  During fiscal year 2015, we commenced activities to close down the operations in our Hillsboro, Oregon testing site which will be completed in fiscal year 2017. 
    
  Also, we announced in July 2015 that we intend to close our wafer level packaging ("WLP") manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas in fiscal year 2017. On April 7, 2016, we entered into an agreement for the sale of its Dallas, Texas campus, including our WLP manufacturing facility, for approximately   $34.5 million  . We completed the sale of our Dallas, Texas campus, including our WLP manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. In connection with this sale agreement, we entered into a lease and facility sharing agreement to lease back portions of the Dallas, Texas campus. We intend to complete the transition of design, administration and manufacturing activities during fiscal year 2017 and discontinue our operations in the WLP manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.  
    
  On April 13, 2016, we entered into agreements for the sale of our micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line, including related assets and inventory, for approximately   $42.2 million  . We completed the sale of our micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require us to make our most difficult and subjective accounting judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes. These policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  . We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period.  
    
  There have been no material changes during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  .

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following table sets forth certain Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income data expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:  

The following table shows stock-based compensation included in the components of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income reported above as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated: 

Net Revenues 
    
  Net revenues were   $561.4 million   and   $562.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Net revenue from automotive products increased by   16.3%  , primarily driven by growth in infotainment. This increase was offset by a decrease in industrial due to the divestiture of our energy metering business, and decreases in consumer and computing products due to changes in demand period over period. 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , approximately   88%   and   89%   of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While more than   98%   of these sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was immaterial. 

26 

Gross Margin  
    
  Our gross margin percentages were   61.6%   and   50.9%   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Our gross margin increased by   10.7%  , primarily from a   $42.5 million   decrease in accelerated depreciation (  7.6%   increase to gross margin). In the three months ended   September 26, 2015  ,   $43.6 million   of accelerated depreciation was recorded relating primarily to the San Jose wafer fabrication facility shut down, which began in the second quarter of 2015 and was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The remaining gross margin improvement was primarily due to the realization of benefits from our manufacturing transformation and cost savings initiatives. 
    
  The below table presents the impact of accelerated depreciation expense on gross margin for all periods presented. 

Research and Development 
    
  Research and development expenses were   $112.7 million   and   $121.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, which represented   20.1%   and   21.6%   of net revenues for each respective period. The   $8.7 million   decrease was a result of headcount reductions primarily due to restructuring programs and spending control efforts. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $70.9 million   and   $72.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, which represented   12.6%   and   12.8%   of net revenues for each respective period. The   $1.1 million   decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal expense. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Impairment of long-lived assets were   $6.1 million   and   $157.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, which represented   1.1%   and   28.0%   of net revenues for each respective period. The   $151.6 million   decrease was primarily due to classification of our wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas as held for sale in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and therefore written down to fair value, less cost to sell. 
    
  Severance and Restructuring Expenses 
    
  Severance and restructuring expenses were   $10.0 million   and   $7.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, which represented   1.8%   and   1.3%   of net revenues for each respective period. The $2.9 million increase was primarily due to reorganization of certain business units and functions and the planned closure of the Dallas wafer level packaging manufacturing facilities. 
    
  Other Operating Expenses (Income), net 
    
  Other operating expenses (income), net were   $(28.5) million   and   $0.3 million   during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, which represented   5.1%   and   0.1%   of net revenues for each respective period. This net increase in other operating income of   $28.8 million   was primarily driven by the   $26.6 million   gain on the sale of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line. 

27 

Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  In the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , we recorded an income tax provision (benefit) of   $27.6 million   and   $(10.0) million  , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   16.7%   and   12.2%  , respectively. 
    
  Our federal statutory tax rate is   35%  . The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates and a   $3.3 million   discrete tax benefit for excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected. 
    
  The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015   was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower tax rates, partially offset by share-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected. 

BACKLOG 
    
  At   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016  , our current quarter backlog was approximately   $370.7 million   and   $363.4 million  , respectively. In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be cancelled in most cases without penalty to customers. In addition, backlog includes orders from domestic distributors for which revenues are not recognized until the products are sold by the distributors. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues. All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Financial Condition 
    
  Cash flows were as follows: 

Operating activities 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $123.4 million   in the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  , an increase of   $6.1 million   compared with the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . This increase was primarily driven by changes in our deferred tax balances of   $68.0 million  . This increase was partially offset by reductions in non-cash adjustments to net income of depreciation and amortization of   $58.6 million   resulting from higher accelerated depreciation in the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , relating primarily to the San Jose wafer fabrication facility shut down, which began in the second quarter of 2015 and was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
    
  Investing activities 
    
  Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases and maturities and acquisitions. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities decreased by   $41.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   compared with the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The decrease was due primarily to   $42.2 million   proceeds from the sale of our micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business, $25.0 million proceeds from the maturity of U.S. treasury securities, and $24.5  
  
    28 

million proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities related to the sale of our wafer manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas. This decrease was partially offset by a $50.2 million increase relating to additional purchase of U.S. treasury securities.  
    
  Financing activities 
    
  Financing cash flows consist primarily of debt issuance, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately   $17.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to   $18.0 million   in additional repurchases of our common stock in the three months ended September 26, 2015.  
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Long Term Debt Levels 
  On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company s   2.5%   senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on November 15, 2018 ( 2018 Notes ). 
    
  On March 18, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of the Company s   3.375%   senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on March 15, 2023 ( 2023 Notes ).  
    
  The estimated fair value of outstanding debt is at   $1,028 million   and   $1,027 million   as of   September 24, 2016   and   June 25, 2016  , respectively. 
  Short Term Credit Agreement 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the Company entered into a short-term credit agreement in an amount equal to   $250.0 million   with a maturity date of June 22, 2017.  The initial interest rate is   1.69%   per annum and will be adjusted quarterly. The fair value approximates the carrying value, given the short-term nature of the loan. 
    
  The Company believes that its existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and available borrowing resources if needed, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The Company s market risk has not changed materially from the interest rate and foreign currency risks disclosed in Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 25, 2016  . 
    
  The impact of inflation and changing prices on the Company s net revenues and on operating income during the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was not material. 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and our chief financial officer ( CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of   September 24, 2016  . Our management, including the CEO and the CFO, has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 24, 2016  . The purpose of these controls and procedures is to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules, and that such information is  
  
    29 

accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 24, 2016   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls  
    
  A system of internal control over financial reporting is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and no control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance. The design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect financial statement errors and misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  On July 25, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to   $1 billion   of the Company s common stock from time to time at the discretion of the Company s management. This stock repurchase authorization has no expiration date.

  The following table summarizes the activity related to stock repurchases for the   three   months ended   September 24, 2016  : 

In the fiscal quarter ended   September 24, 2016  , the Company repurchased approximately   1.5 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $57.7 million  . As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had remaining authorization of   $272.0 million   for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company s common stock and general market and business conditions.

  Section 6.        Advance Notice Procedures 
    
  (a)        Advance Notice of Stockholder Business  . 
    
  At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been  properly brought  before  the  meeting.  To  be  properly brought  before  an  annual  meeting, business must be brought:   (i) pursuant to the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) by a stockholder of the Corporation who (1) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in these Bylaws and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has timely complied in proper written form with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 6(a). In addition, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to these Bylaws and applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, clause (iii) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders. 
    
  (1)    To comply with clause (iii) of Section 6(a) above, a stockholder s notice must set  forth  all information  required  under this  Section  6(a)  and  must  be timely received  by the Secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the 45th day nor earlier than the 75th day before the one-year anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials or a notice of availability of proxy materials (whichever is earlier) for the preceding year s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of the date of the previous year s annual meeting, then notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received by the Secretary not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting, or (ii) the tenth day following the day on which Public Announcement (as defined below) of the date of such  

annual meeting is first made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described in this Section 6(a)(1).  Public Announcement  shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto (the  1934 Act ). 
    
  (2)    To be in proper written form, a stockholder s notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter of business the stockholder intends to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business intended to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation s books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are held of record or are beneficially owned by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person and any derivative positions  held or beneficially held by the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person,  (iv)  whether  and  the  extent  to  which  any  hedging  or  other  transaction  or  series  of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the Corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit from share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any securities of the Corporation, (v) any material interest of the stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person in such business and (vi) a statement whether either such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation s voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (i) through (vi), a  Business Solicitation Statement ).  In addition, to be in proper written form, a stockholder s notice to the Secretary must be supplemented not later than ten days following the record date to disclose the information contained in clauses (iii) and (iv) above as of the record date. For purposes of this Section 6, a  Stockholder Associated Person  of any stockholder shall mean (1) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (2) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made (3) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person referred to in the preceding clauses (1) and (2). 
    
  (3)    Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 6(a) and, if applicable, Section 6(b).  In addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material  fact  or  omits  to  state  a  material  fact  necessary  to  make  the  statements  therein  not misleading.  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(a), and, if the chairman should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the annual meeting that any such business not properly brought before the annual meeting shall not be conducted. 
    
  (b)        Advance Notice of Director Nominations at Annual Meetings  . 

Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6(b) shall be eligible for election or re- election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by a stockholder of the Corporation who (1) was a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in these Bylaws and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and (2) has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 6(b).  In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation. 
    
  (1)    To comply with clause (ii) of Section 6(b) above, a nomination to be made by a stockholder must set forth all information required under this Section 6(b) and must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation at the time and in accordance with the final three sentences of Section 6(a)(1) above. 
    
  (2)        To be in proper written form, such stockholder s notice to the Secretary must set forth: 
    
  (A)  as to each person (a  nominee ) whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the nominee, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the nominee, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are held of record or are beneficially owned by the nominee and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the nominee, (iv) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of the nominee with respect to any securities of the Corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of the nominee, (v) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (vi) a written statement executed by the nominee acknowledging that as a director of the Corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under Delaware law with respect to the Corporation and its stockholders, and (vii) any other information relating to the nominee that would be required to be disclosed about such nominee if proxies were being solicited for the election of the nominee as a director, or that is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation the nominee s written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and 
    
  (B)   as to such stockholder giving notice, (i) the information required to be provided pursuant to clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 6(a)(2) above, and the supplement referenced in the second sentence of Section 6(a)(2) above (except that the references to  business  in such clauses shall instead refer to nominations of directors for purposes of this paragraph), and (ii) a statement whether either such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a number of the Corporation s voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person to be necessary to elect such nominee(s) (such information provided and statements made as required by clauses (i) and (ii) above, a  Nominee Solicitation Statement ). 
    
  (3)    At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director must furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation (i) that information required to be set forth in the stockholder s notice of nomination of such person as a director as of a date subsequent to  

the date on which the notice of such person s nomination was given and (ii) such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee; in the absence of the furnishing of such information if requested, such stockholder s nomination shall not be considered in proper form pursuant to this Section 6(b). 
    
  (4)   Without exception, no person shall be eligible for election or re-election as a director of the Corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 6(b). In addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.   The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the annual meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions prescribed by these Bylaws, and if the chairman should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the annual meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. 
    
  (c)        Advance Notice of Director Nominations for Special Meetings  . 
    
  (1)    For  a  special  meeting  of  stockholders  at  which  directors  are  to  be  elected pursuant to Section 7 hereof, nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors shall be made only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in these Bylaws and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting and (B) delivers a timely written notice of the nomination to the Secretary of the Corporation that includes the information set forth in Sections 6(b)(2) and (3) above.

In addition, a nominee shall not be  eligible  for  election  or  re-election  if  a  stockholder  or  Stockholder  Associated  Person,  as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. 
    
  (2)    The chairman of the special meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination or business was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if the chairman should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination or business shall be disregarded.

in the Corporation s proxy statement, the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act. Nothing in this Section 6 shall be deemed to affect any right of the Corporation to omit a proposal from the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 
  14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act. 
    
  Section 7.        Special Meetings. 
    
  (a)       A special meeting of the stockholders, other than those required by statute, may be called at any time, for any purpose or purposes, by (1) the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board; and (2) by the holders of outstanding stock of the Corporation holding at least thirty-five percent (35%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote (the  35% Stockholders  but a special meeting may not be called by any other person or persons.  For purposes of these Bylaws, the term  Whole Board  shall mean the total number of authorized Directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.  The Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board or the 35% Stockholders may cancel, postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to the stockholders. 
    
  (b)       The notice of a special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called.   Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Whole Board or by or at the direction of the 35% stockholders.  Nothing contained in this Section 7(b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors or the 35% stockholders may be held. 
    
  Section 8.        Notice of Meetings and Adjourned Meetings. 
    
  (a)       Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of  Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour and purpose or purposes of the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to his address as it appears upon the books of the Corporation; except that where the matter to be acted on is a merger or consolidation of the Corporation or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of its assets, such notice shall be given not less than 20 nor more than 60 days prior to such meeting. 
    
  (b)      If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle shareholders fulfilling the requirements of section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section. 
    
  (c)       When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 
    
  (d)       Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and, to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any  

stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. 
    
  (e)       Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders  given by the Corporation  under any provision of this chapter, the certificate of incorporation, or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 
    
  Notice given pursuant to this subparagraph (e) shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of these Bylaws,  electronic transmission  means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 
    
  Section 9.       Quorum. 
    
  At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Any shares, the voting of which at said meeting has been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at such meeting. In the absence of a quorum any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the Corporation. 
    
  Section 10.     Adjournment of Meetings. 
    
  Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are present either in person or by proxy. 
    
  Section 11.     Voting Rights. 

(a)       Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote  stand  on  the  stock  records  of  the  Corporation  on  the  record  date  for  determining  the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. 
    
  (b)       Every person entitled to vote or to execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three (3) years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given. All elections of Directors shall be by ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. Such ballot may be in writing executed by the stockholder or his proxyholder or it may be cast by electronic transmission, provided that the transmission includes information showing that the transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxyholder. 
    
  (c)       Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: 
    
  (1)    A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or his authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature. 
    
  (2)    A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Such authorization can be established by the signature of the stockholder on the proxy, either in writing or by a signature stamp or facsimile signature, or by a number or symbol from which the identity of the stockholder can be determined, or by any other procedure deemed appropriate by the inspectors or other persons making the determination as to due authorization. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied. 
    
  (d)       Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 
    
  Section 12.     Joint Owners of Stock. 
    
  If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the  

same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even split for the purpose of this subsection shall be a majority or even split in interest. 
    
  Section 13.     List of Stockholders. 
    
  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The Corporation need not include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 
    
  Section 14.     Action without Meeting. 
    
  (a)       Any action required by statute to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. 
    
  (b)       Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner herein required, written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take action are delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a Corporation s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by  

less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. 
    
  (c)       A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consent to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this section, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder, and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in this State, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation s registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 
    
  (d)      Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 
    
  (e)       No such action by written consent may be taken following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of securities of the Corporation under the 1934 Act.

The Board will act on the Committee s recommendation within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the date of the certification of the election results.

If no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. When one or more Directors shall resign from the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the Directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each Director so chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place shall be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

  Section 34.        Lost Certificates. 
    
  No certificate for shares of stock of the Corporation shall be issued in place of any previously issued certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, except upon timely production of such evidence of the loss, theft or destruction and upon the timely making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed such indemnification of the Corporation and its agent to such extent and in such manner as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe.

Delivery made to a corporation s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record  

date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing or by electronic transmission without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 
    
  (c)       In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders  entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action.

Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person.

ARTICLE XI 
  INDEMNIFICATION 
    
  Section 42.        Indemnification of Officers, Directors, Employees and Other Agents. 
    
  (a)         Directors  . The Corporation shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
    
  (b)         Officers,  Employees  and  Other  Agents  .  The  Corporation  shall  have  power  to indemnify its officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
    
  (c)        Good Faith  . 
    
  (1)    For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a Director, or any member of a committee designated by the Board of Directors, shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to  believe  that  his  conduct  was  unlawful,  if  he  relied  in  good  faith  upon  the  records  of  the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of the Corporation s officers or employees, or committees of the Board of Directors, or by any other person as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within such other person s professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation. 
    
  (2)    The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon  

a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 
    
  (3)    The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
    
  (d)         Expenses  .  The  Corporation  shall  advance,  prior  to  the  final  disposition  of  any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any Director in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise. 
    
  (e)         Enforcement  . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation and the Director who serves in such capacity at any time while this Bylaw and other relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a Director shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. 
    
  The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. The Corporation shall be entitled to raise by pleading as an affirmative defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition when the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
    
  (f)          Non-Exclusivity of Rights  . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
    
  (g)         Survival of Rights  . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 

(h)         Insurance  . To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw. 
    
  (i)          Amendments  . Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation. 
    
  (j)          Savings Clause.   If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. 
    
  (k)        Certain Definitions  . For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply: 
    
  (1)   The term  proceeding  shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement and appeal of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. 
    
  (2)   The term  expenses  shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, court costs, attorneys  fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding. 
    
  (3)    The  term  the   Corporation   shall  include,  in  addition  to  the  resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 
    
  (4)    References to a  director,   officer,   employee,  or  agent  of the Corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

The  period  or  limitation  of  time  within  which  any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any Director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such Director to receive such notice. 
    
  (h)         Notice  to  Person  with  Whom  Communication  Is  Unlawful  .

Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the  

filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
