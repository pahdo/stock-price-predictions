Summary   

Globe
Net is a Nevada company and was incorporated on September 4, 2009. Globe Net is a  shell  company as defined by the
SEC as a result of only having nominal operations and nominal assets. Globe Net is an  emerging growth company  under
the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.  

In
August 2016 Globe Net began developing software to be used in the open source application programming interface (  API  )
ecosystems. In November 2016 Globe Net completed its beta-testing of its new mobile text marketing platform, TextPro Connect IQ,
and has commenced the development and testing of a second API application known as Swappit. Management is also actively looking
for other related applications to develop and incubate.  

Globe
Net is also continuing with the development of its Internet and wireless connectivity systems to provide internet and related
services to both consumers and businesses in currently under serviced or unserviceable areas at real broadband speeds. .   

Since
September 2009, Globe Net has had its executive head office at 2302-3 Pacific Plaza, 410 Des Voeux Road West, Hong Kong. The telephone
number at this office is ( 253)252-8637 . Globe Net is renting the administrative office on a month to month basis.

Net has an authorized capital of 200,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share with 10.8 million common shares
currently issued and outstanding.  

Globe
Net has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings. There have been no material reclassifications,
mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of Globe Net s

Description
of Business   

App
Incubator Segment   

In
August of 2016 Globe Net began to develop its business concept to capitalize on the proliferation of open source application programming
interface (API) ecosystems. Management ascertained one of the key success metrics today is service velocity or the speed with
which services can be developed and introduced to the market to generate revenue.  

Currently,
Globe Net has developed its TextPro app and is currently developing its second app. Swappit, for its app incubator business segment.
TextPro Connect IQ is a single, unified, web-based system allowing customers to create campaigns that utilize a variety of marketing
tools. Swappit it is a person to person online swapping platform.  

Digital
services in the API economy are increasingly being developed using a new design pattern known as microservices. Wikipedia defines
microservices as:  a software architecture style in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes
communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs.  

In
order to take advantage of the API ecosystem economy, Globe Net wants to become an agile business, able to participate in on-demand,
context driven API economy value chains and to bring new services to market faster. The network as a digital platform will enable
them to design and deploy customer-facing digital services by  mashing up  network and IT service components that
run in the platform with each other, and potentially with services exposed by third-party platforms.  

Rural
Internet Service Provider (RISP) Segment   

During
the fiscal period ending August 31, 2016 Globe Net was still working on the development of its business segment to provide rural
communities with high-speed internet connectivity at speeds equal or better than existing competing services. Through the use
of its Internet and wireless connectivity systems, Globe Net s goal is to develop and provide internet and related services
to both consumers and businesses in currently under serviced or unserviceable areas at real broadband speeds. Globe Net planned
to offer for sale its GNW Systems to residents and businesses located in under-serviced or non-serviced rural areas worldwide
with the initial focus on North America and China. Although Globe Net continues to attempt to achieve its goal of becoming a rural
internet provider, management s current plan is to focus on Globe Net s app business.  

See
 Plan of Operation  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  below for
more information. As of the effective date of this prospectus Globe Net has not generated any revenues.  

Products   

TextPro
Connect IQ   

TextPro
Connect IQ is a single, unified, web-based system allowing customers to create campaigns that utilize a variety of marketing tools,
including mobile coupons, SMS marketing, QR codes, mobile keywords, Mobile splash pages, surveys, voting, polls, email marketing
and social media status updates. Additionally, business and event planners have the ability to offer text reminders. Small businesses
that rely on scheduled meetings with customers can do away with fears of missed appointments, reservations, or scheduled maintenance
and repairs.  

Globe
Net utilizes a software as a service (SAAS) model for TextPro Connect IQ. SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and
run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning
and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Customers are charged a monthly fee for access to our
platform and purchase voice and text credits from us using a PayPal gateway.  

Swappit   

Swappit
it is a person to person online swapping platform. Users download the app, and then set their criteria which will allow Swappit
to find a potential swapping match. The criteria will be based on how long you are willing to trade for in days or weeks, the
distance you are willing to travel to trade in kilometers or miles, you item category and price level, then a picture of the items.
Once all the parameters have been entered by the user, then the Swappit app will then search through it database of users to find
a potential swapping match and allow the user to decide if they want to proceed with a swap or wait and search for more items.
Once a match is what the user desires they simply arrange to meet the other user and complete the swap.  

RISP   

Globe
Net is still developing a system to deliver high-speed Internet service wirelessly to rural subscribers. It is Globe Net s
goal is to offer quality, high-speed wireless Internet service to end-users who are without Internet service or underserviced
as a result of inferior technologies. Globe Net intends to develop a new technology that will broadcast an omni-directional wireless
signal with a radius of up to approximately 20 miles using 700MHz spectrum. Unlike microwave, WiFi, or WiMax, direct line of sight
is not necessary, which increases its practicality while reducing broadcasting costs. Globe Net s Internet and wireless
connectivity systems will transmit high-speed Internet service wirelessly over the 600MHz - 800MHz spectrum, 700MHz being the
optimal band, at speeds as high as 20Mbps (megabits per second) download and 4Mbps upload. The signal will be transmitted from
an omni-directional antenna mounted on an elevated structure, such as a transmission or communications tower. Because the signal
is transmitted at a relatively low frequency, it is not as susceptible to obstructions as Wi-Fi or satellite services, as the
signal can penetrate through most vegetation and other solid obstacles such as buildings.  

Status
of Products   

TextPro
Connect IQ   

As
of November 2016 TextPro Connect IQ is available for download on Globe Net s website and customers are able to begin using
the app immediately. Globe Net offers three distinct TextPro Connect IQ packages;  

Globe
Net also offers add on packages for customers who require additional voice or text messages but are not ready to move to the next
level of packages offered.  

Swappit   

At
the date of this filing Swappit remains in development stage and is not available for download.  

RISP   

To
date, Globe Net has not started any research or development on the RISP product.  

Markets   

Globe
Net s App incubator products will be worldwide and will only be limited by internet access prohibition exercised by certain
countries (i.e. China, North Korea, Cuba and Miramar)  

Beginning
with and focusing on China and North America, Globe Net plans to offer for sale, once development is completed, its RISP products
to residents and businesses located in under-serviced or non-serviced rural areas. Globe Net will target rural areas or installation
communities with the potential for a minimum of 300 subscribers for its Internet packages and related services. When Globe Net
has sufficient revenue and assets to expand, Globe Net plans to expand to other markets where residents and businesses require
a rural internet service provider, which may include Europe and South America.  

Distribution
Methods   

Globe
Net intends to advertise the availability of products and related service packages in the target markets through social media,
word of mouth and online advertising campaigns. Distribution of Globe Nets Apps  will be conducted directly to customers
via the company website  www.globenetwireless.com  as well as the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.  

Globe
Net intends to advertise the availability of the RISP products in the target markets through traditional print and radio media.
Distribution of the RISP products will be conducted by an employee or consultant of Globe Net for both the transmitting end and
the receiving end of the system.  

Competitive
Conditions   

The
app market is highly competitive and the percentage of companies that survive and prosper is small. App development companies
often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, manufacturing, marketing, financing, and general management,
among others, which frequently cannot be solved. In addition, companies may require substantial amounts of financing, which may
not be available through institutional private placements, the public markets or otherwise.  

Globe
Net s app incubator business is extremely competitive and always changing. Within the app marketplace, there are an enormous
number of corporations that are competing for online users, advertising dollars, sponsorship fees and many other unique opportunities
for revenue. Many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including:  

1.  
      greater
    financial, technical and marketing resources that can be devoted to the development, promotion and sale of their services;   

2.  
      easier
    and more access to capital;   

3.  
      longer
    operating histories;   

4.  
      greater
    name recognition and established corporate identity;   

5.  
      larger
    user base; and   

6.  
      developed
    apps and websites.   

Raw
Materials / Equipment   

The
raw materials for the Globe Net app incubator business will include computers, GPS enabled smartphones, open source software and
labor to write software code.  

Globe
Net will need the omni-directional antennae, servers, amplifiers and transmitters for transmitting its RISP signal as well asYagi-Uda
directional antennae, routers and a receiver to receive its RISP signal.  

Principal
Suppliers   

Globe
Net is not dependent on any single supplier for the app incubator business. However, Globe Net will depend on outside programmers
and consultants to provide innovative solutions and programming expertise.  

Globe
Net currently has no principal suppliers for equipment or services for its RISP business. Globe Net needs to establish a supply
chain for the required equipment and the raw materials for its RISP Business. Also, Globe Net will need to identify service providers
within the rural installation communities to provide the required services to the subscribers.  

Dependence
on Customers   

Currently,
Globe Net is not and will not be dependent on one or a few major customers.  

Trademark
and Licenses   

Globe
Net currently has no patents or trademarks; and Globe Net is not party to any license, franchise, concession, or royalty agreements
or any labor contracts.  

Government
Approvals and Regulations   

Currently,
Globe Net is in compliance with all business and operations licenses that are typically applicable to most commercial ventures.
However, there can be no assurance that existing or new laws or regulations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in the
future will not impose additional fees and taxes on Globe Net and its business operations. Management is not aware of any such
revisions to existing laws and regulations nor new laws or regulations that could have a negative impact on Globe Net s
business and add additional costs to Globe Net s business operations.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Globe
Net has not spent any funds on either company-sponsored research and development activities or customer-sponsored research activities
relating to the development of new products, services or techniques or the improvement of existing products, services, or techniques.  

Employees   

Globe
Net currently does not have any employees. Globe Net intends to retain the services of trained staff and technicians as needed,
which will include technical and administrative personnel and service provider technicians. Globe Net will also retain consultants
on an  as needed basis .

(2015: $16,641), and $4,867 in interest expense (2015: $3,200).  

Globe
Net has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to complete its proposed business plan. For
these reasons Globe Net s auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that Globe Net will be able to continue as a
going concern.  

Globe
Net s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not
include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should Globe Net be unable to continue in operation.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of August 31, 2016, Globe Net s current assets consisted of $3,684 in cash with total liabilities of $103,521, which consisted
of convertible notes payable of $50,500, notes payable of $30,000, accounts payable of $871 and accrued liabilities of $22,150.
Management expects Globe Net will require additional capital to meet its long term operating requirements. Management expects
to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities .   

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

Globe
Net has not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows
used in operating activities were ($37,010) consisting of our net loss for the period, adjusted for expensing prepaid expenses
and payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

Globe
Net has financed its operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2016, net cash from financing activities was nil.  

Plan
of Operation   

Globe
Net s plan of operation for the next 12 months is to:  

1.  
      advance
    the TextPro Connect IQ app customer base via social media and online awareness programs;   

2.  
      complete
    development and launch the Swappit app; and   

3.  
      identify
    and develop more business mobile app customers that will take advantage of the expanding API ecosystem economy.   

Phase 1     
       Advance the TextPro Connect IQ App Customer Based Via Social Media and Online Awareness Programs    

In
Phase 1, Globe Net will use social media platforms, including, but not limited to, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in order to
build brand awareness for TextPro Connect IQ and increase the number of downloads of the TextPro Connect IQ app. Globe Net plans
to drive brand awareness and deliver our message to target audiences use Facebook postings and ad s to bring attention to
the TextPro Connect IQ app as well as establishing a page on YouTube containing how to videos giving users a concise way to begin
using the app to drive customers to their business.  

Globe
Net has budgeted $15,000 for this phase and expects it to take three months to complete, with completion expected within the first
three months of Globe Net s plan of operation.  

Phase 2      
       Complete Development and Launch the Swappit App.    

In
Phase 2, Globe Net plans to complete its development of the Swappit app.  

The
coding and programming involved in completing the Swappit app is estimated to require in excess of 200 hours. Globe Net has budgeted
$15,000 for this phase and expects it to take 10 months to complete, with completion expected in the 4 th  quarter of
2017.  

Phase 3     
       Identify and Develop More Business Mobile App Customers That Will Take Advantage of the Expanding API Ecosystem Economy    

In
Phase 3, Globe Net plans to develop in house three additional apps that will take advantage of the API ecosystem. The apps will
be designed to assist small business clients to drive customers to their businesses and create marketing lists and allow instant
contact to their customer bases with coupons, contests and special offers.  

Globe
Net has budgeted $50,000 for this phase and expects it to take 12 months to complete, with completion expected within the first
twelve months of Globe Net s plan of operation. Also, during this phase, Globe Net will continue to (a) develop its Swappit
app, (b) advance the TextPro Connect IQ app customer base. Phase 3 will overlap and will be worked on simultaneously with Phases
1 and 2.  

It
is possible that actual costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 will exceed Globe Net s estimates. As well, Globe Net s current
cash on hand is not sufficient to meet its anticipated obligations for the next twelve-month period. Globe Net intends to raise
additional funding either through the sale of its common stock to investors or through loans from its director. However, Globe
Net does not have any current commitments in this regard. If Globe Net is unable to raise the required financing, it will be delayed
in conducting its business plan.  

Accounting
and Audit Plan   

Globe
Net intends to continue to have its outside consultant assist in the preparation of Globe Net s quarterly and annual financial
statements and have these financial statements reviewed or audited by Globe Net s independent auditor. Globe Net s
outside consultant is expected to charge Globe Net approximately $700 to prepare Globe Net s quarterly financial statements
and approximately $2,000 to prepare Globe Net s annual financial statements. Globe Net s independent auditor is expected
to charge approximately $1,000 to review each of Globe Net s quarterly financial statements and approximately $7,500 to
audit Globe Net s annual financial statements. In the next twelve months, Globe Net anticipates spending approximately $12,000
to pay for its accounting and audit requirements.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of the date of this annual report, Globe Net does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

Material
Commitments for Capital Expenditures   

Globe
Net had no contingencies or long-term commitments at August 31, 2016.  

Tabular
Disclosure of Contractual Obligations

required under this item.  

Going
Concern   

The
independent auditors  report accompanying Globe Net s August, 2016 and 2015 financial statements contain an explanatory
paragraph expressing substantial doubt about Globe Net s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
have been prepared assuming that Globe Net will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that it will realize its assets
and satisfy its liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

REPORT OF IND EPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To
the Stockholders of  

  Globe
Net Wireless Corp.:  

I
have audited the accompanying balance sheet Globe Net Wireless Corp. as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements
of operations, stockholders  equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  

I
conducted my audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
Those standards require that I plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audits provides a reasonable basis for my
opinion.  

In
my opinion, based on my audits, these financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the change in equity and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
incurred operating losses since inception, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to their planned financing and other matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

      NOTES
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

   August
31, 2016   

1.   
       Organization
    and nature of operations    

Globe
    Net Wireless Corp. ( the Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on September 4, 2009. The Company
    is in its early development stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company
    is engaged in the development of a telecommunication business to provide internet and related services to both consumers and
    businesses currently in under serviced or unserviced areas at real broadband speeds through the proprietary wireless technology
    it acquired.   

The
    Company has chosen an August 31 year end.   

2.   
       Basis
    of Presentation - Going Concern Uncertainties    

These
    financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
    which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has limited operations and has sustained
    operating losses resulting in a deficit.    

The
    Company has accumulated a deficit of $176,868 since inception September 4, 2009, has yet to achieve profitable operations
    and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern
    is in substantial doubt and is dependent upon obtaining additional financing and/or achieving a sustainable profitable level
    of operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  The
    Company may seek additional equity as necessary and it expects to raise funds through private or public equity investment
    in order to support existing operations and expand the range of its business. There is no assurance that such additional funds
    will be available for the Company on acceptable terms, if at all.   

3.   
       Summary
    of significant accounting policies    

Basis
    of presentation     

The
    accompanying financial statements are stated in US dollars and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America.    

Use
    of estimates    

The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information
    available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting
    rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

   NOTES
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   August
31, 2016   

Concentration
of credit risk   

The
Company places its cash with a high credit quality financial institution. The Company maintains United States Dollars at a bank
in the Slovenia that are not insured. The Company minimizes its credit risks associated with cash by periodically evaluating the
credit quality of its primary financial institution.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company follows the guideline under ASC Topic 740  Income Taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates, applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances
are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Since the Company is in
the developmental stage and has losses, no deferred tax asset or income taxes have been recorded in the financial statements.  

Comprehensive
income   

The
Company has adopted ASC 220  Comprehensive Income , which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income, its components and accumulated balances. The Company is disclosing this information on its Statement of Stockholders'
Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except that resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  

For
the period ended August 31, 2016, there are no reconciling items between the net loss presented in the statements of operations
and comprehensive loss as defined by ASC 220  

Foreign
currency translations   

The
Company is located and operating outside of the United States of America. The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar.
At the transaction date, each asset, liability, revenue and expense is translated into U.S. dollars by the use of the exchange
rate in effect at that date.  At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured by using the exchange rate
in effect at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operations.  

Financial
instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and their carrying values approximate
fair value because of their short-term nature. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest
or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

   NOTES
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   August
31, 2016   

Loss
per share  

The
Company reports basic loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260  Earnings Per Share  ( EPS ). Basic
loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and diluted EPS is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss (numerator)
applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) for the period. There
are no potentially dilutive securities outstanding and therefore, diluted earnings per share on not presented. All per share and
per share information are adjusted retroactively to reflect stock splits and changes in par value.  

Fair
value measurements   

The
Company follows the guidelines in ASC Topic 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . Fair value is defined as
the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required
to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact
and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such
as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.  

The
Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels
and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair
value measurement:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  

Level
3 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including
option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.  

ASC
Topic 820, in and of itself, does not require any fair value measurements. As at August 31, 2016, the Company did not have assets
or liabilities subject to fair value measurement.  

Website
Development Costs   

The
Company recognizes the costs associated with developing a website in accordance with ASC 350-50  Website Development Cost 
that codified the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA ) Statement of Position ( SOP )
NO. 98-1,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use . Relating to website
development costs the Company follows the guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) NO. 00-2,  Accounting
for Website Development Costs . The website development costs are divided into three stages, planning, development and production.
The development stage can further be classified as application and infrastructure development, graphics development and content
development. In short, website development cost for internal use should be capitalized except content input and data conversion
costs in content development stage. Amortization is based on estimated useful life on a straight line basis and will start when
the software is ready for use.

   NOTES
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   August
31, 2016   

Convertible
debt   

The
Company accounts for convertible debt according to ASC 470,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options . No portion of
the proceeds is attributable to the conversion feature when there is no beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). There
is no BCF when the debt instrument is convertible into common stock at a specified price at the option of the holder and when
the debt instrument is issued at a price not significantly in excess of the face amount.  

Where
a BCF exists, the conversion feature is accounted for according to ASC 815-15,  Derivatives and Hedging, Embedded Derivatives ,
which bifurcates the instrument according to the relative fair values of the debt and the conversion feature at the time of issuance.  

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements  

The
Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
which may be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently
issued would, if adopted, have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.  

4.      Notes
                                         payable     

The
company has four notes payable that are unsecured, bear interest at 8% per annum and are due on demand. The interest is classified
as accrued liabilities for financial statement purposes.  

5.      Convertible
                                         Note Payable     

There
are five convertible notes payable. The notes are unsecured, bearing interest at 8% per annum which is due on demand, and convertible
at a conversion price of $0.005 per share at the lender s option. The interest is classified as accrued liabilities for
financial statement purposes.  

There was no value assigned
to the conversion feature of the notes issued during the year ended August 31, 2016 as the value of the BCF was determined
to be $ nil, based on the fact the shares were not actively traded. 

There
is one convertible note payable that bears an interest at 8% per annum which is due on demand, and convertible at a conversion
price of $0.5625 per share at the lender s option. The interest is classified as accrued liabilities for financial statement
purposes.

   NOTES
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   August
31, 2016   

There
was no value assigned to the conversion feature of the notes issued during the year ended August 31, 2016 as the shares that would
have been issued are not readily convertible into cash. 

6.   
       Common
    stock    

There
    were no warrants or stock options outstanding as of August 31, 2016.   

There
    were no significant non-cash transactions during the period ended August 31, 2016.   

7.   
       Income
    Tax    

Income
    tax recovery differs from that which would be expected from applying the effective tax rates to the net loss as follows:   

The
Company has accumulated non-capital income tax losses of $174,002. Under normal circumstances the losses will expire in the years
2029 to 2036.  

As
at August 31, 2016, the tax effect of the temporary timing differences that give rise to significant components of deferred income
tax asset are noted below. A valuation allowance has been recorded as management believes it is more likely than not that the
deferred income tax asset will not be realized.  

Item
9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure    

Since inception on September 4, 2009, there
were no disagreements with Globe Net s principal accountants on any matter of accounting principle or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. In addition, there were no reportable events as described in Item 304 of
Regulation S-K that occurred within Globe Net s two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim periods. Globe Net s
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm since January 2011 has been K. R. Margetson Ltd., Chartered Professional
Accountant, of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 

Item
9A(T): Controls and Procedures    

A.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As
required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Globe Net s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) for the period covered by this annual report as of its fiscal year end, August 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation,
this officer concluded that as of the end of the period, these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate to ensure that
the information required to be disclosed by Globe Net in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
include controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
Globe Net s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that
Globe Net s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports that Globe Net files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in Globe Net s
internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

B.
Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Globe Net s financial reporting. In order
to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  

Globe
Net s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  

Based
on Globe Net s evaluation, its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Globe Net s internal
controls over financial reporting were not effective as of August 31, 2016 and were subject to material weaknesses.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses in Globe Net s internal control
over financial reporting using the criteria established in the COSO:  

1.
Failing to have an audit committee or other independent committee that is independent of management to assess internal control
over financial reporting; and  

2.
Failing to have a director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation
S-K.  

3. Lack of segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives. 

4. Insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and applications of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of Globe Net s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Globe Net s internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation
by Globe Net s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit Globe Net
to provide only management s report in this annual report.  

C.

    the bankruptcy or two years prior to that time;

    or banking activities;

    organization, any registered entity, or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary
    authority over its members or persons associated with a member.    

(e) Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.  

Section
16(a) of the Security Exchange Act of 1934 requires directors, executive officers and 10% or greater shareholders of Globe Net
to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership (Form 3) and reports of changes in ownership
of equity securities of the Company (Form 4 and Form 5) and to provide copies of all such Forms as filed to Globe Net. Based solely
on Globe Net s review of the copies of these forms received by it or representations from certain reporting persons, management
believes that SEC beneficial ownership reporting requirements for fiscal 2016 were met, with the exception of the following: (1)
Ku Wai Li failed to file a Form 3   Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities, a Form 4   Change of
Beneficial Ownership of Securities, and a Form 5 - Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities; (2) Gustavo
Americo Folcarelli failed to file a Form 3   Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities, a Form 4   Change
of Beneficial Ownership of Securities, a Form 5 - Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities, and a Schedule
13D.  

(f)
Nomination Procedure for Directors   

Globe
Net does not have a standing nominating committee; recommendations for candidates to stand for election as directors are made
by the board of directors. Globe Net has not adopted a policy that permits shareholders to recommend candidates for election as
directors or a process for shareholders to send communications to the board of directors.  

(g)
Audit Committee Financial Expert   

Globe
Net has no financial expert. Management believes the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive.
Globe Net s Board of Directors has determined that it does not presently need an audit committee financial expert on the
Board of Directors to carry out the duties of the Audit Committee. Globe Net s Board of Directors has determined that the
cost of hiring a financial expert to act as a director of Globe Net and to be a member of the Audit Committee or otherwise perform
Audit Committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert on the Audit Committee.  

(h)
Identification of Audit Committee   

Globe
Net does not have a separately-designated standing audit committee. Rather, Globe Net s entire board of directors perform
the required functions of an audit committee. Currently, Gustavo Americo Folcarelli is the only member of Globe Net s audit
committee, but he does not meet Globe Net s independent requirements for an audit committee member. See  Item 13.
(c) Director independence  below for more information on independence.  

Globe
Net s audit committee is responsible for: (1) selection and oversight of Globe Net s independent accountant; (2) establishing
procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters;
(3) establishing procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by Globe Net s employees of concerns regarding accounting
and auditing matters; (4) engaging outside advisors; and, (5) funding for the outside auditor and any outside advisors engaged
by the audit committee.  

As
of August 31, 2016, Globe Net did not have a written audit committee charter or similar document.  

(i) Code of Ethics   

Globe
Net has adopted a financial code of ethics that applies to all its executive officers and employees, including its CEO and CFO.
See Exhibit 14   Code of Ethics for more information. Globe Net undertakes to provide any person with a copy of its financial
code of ethics free of charge. Please contact Globe Net at  (253)252-8637  to request a copy of Globe Net s financial
code of ethics. Management believes Globe Net s financial code of ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and
promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply
with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations; and provide accountability for adherence to the code.

service contracts.

Item
12: Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters    

(a
 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners (more than 5%)   

[1]
 The listed beneficial owner has no right to acquire any shares within 60 days of the date of this Form 10-K from options,
warrants, rights, conversion privileges or similar obligations excepted as otherwise noted.  

[2]
 Based on 10,800,000 common shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2016.  

(b)
Security Ownership of Management  

[1]
 Based on 10,800,000 common shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2016.  

Each
person listed above has full voting and investment power with respect to the common shares indicated. Under the rules of the SEC,
a person (or a group of persons) is deemed to be a  beneficial owner  of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly,
has or shares power to vote or to direct the voting of such security. Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a
beneficial owner of the same security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has
the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase Globe Net s common shares.  

(c)
Changes in Control   

Management
is not aware of any arrangement that may result in a change in control of Globe Net with the exception that on August 16, 2016
Ku Wai Li and Gustavo Americo Folcarelli entered into the Purchase Agreement and pursuant thereto Gustavo Americo Folcarelli purchased
and Mr. Li sold an aggregate of 2 million previously issued and outstanding shares of Globe Net s restricted common stock,
equal to18.5%of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Globe Net for the aggregate purchase price of $3,500.00. For more
details see Exhibit 10.1   Share Purchase Agreement.  

Also,
on August 16, 2016, Gustavo Americo Folcarelli consented to and was appointed the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the
Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer, and the Corporate Secretary of Globe Net by the board of directors.  

And
finally, effective September 22, 2016, Mr. Folcarelli was appointed the new sole director of Globe Net following the effective
resignation of Ku Wai Li and the conclusion of the 10-day period following the filing of a Schedule 14f-1 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the mailing of a copy to each of Globe Net s shareholders of record as of September 7, 2016.  

The
board of directors and management of Globe Net currently consists of Gustavo Americo Folcarelli as the sole director and as the
President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer, and the Corporate Secretary of Globe Net.  

Item
13: Certain Relationships and Related Transactions    

None
of the following parties has, since our date of incorporation, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction
with us or in any presently proposed transaction that has or will materially affect us:  

*  
      Any
    of our directors or officers;   
 
      *  
      Any
    person proposed as a nominee for election as a director;   
 
      *  
      Any
    person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to our outstanding
    shares of common stock;   
 
      *  
      Our
    promoters, Ku Wai Li and now Gustavo Americo Folcarelli;    
 
      *  
      Any
    relative or spouse of any of the foregoing persons who has the   

same
    house as such person;   
 
      *  
      Immediate
    family members of directors, director nominees, executive    

officers
    and owners of 5% or more of our common stock   

(c)
Director independence   

Globe
Net s board of directors currently solely consists of Gustavo Americo Folcarelli. Pursuant to Item 407(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation
S-K of the Securities Act, Globe Net s board of directors has adopted the definition of  independent director 
as set forth in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Manual. In summary, an  independent director  means a person other
than an executive officer or employee of Globe Net or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of Globe
Net s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgement in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director, and includes any director who accepted any compensation from Globe Net in excess of $200,000 during any period
of 12 consecutive months with the three past fiscal years. Also, the ownership of Globe Net s stock will not preclude a
director from being independent.  

In
applying this definition, Globe Net s board of directors has determined that Mr. Folcarelli does not qualify as an  independent
director  pursuant to the same rule.  

As
of the date of the report, Globe Net did not maintain a separately designated compensation or nominating committee.  

Globe
Net has also adopted this definition for the independence of the members of its audit committee. Gustavo Americo Folcarelli is
the sole member of Globe Net s audit committee as a result of being the sole director. Globe Net s board of directors
has determined that Mr. Folcarelli is not  independent  for purposes of Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Manual, applicable
to audit, compensation and nominating committee members, and is  independent  for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3) of
the Securities Exchange Act.
