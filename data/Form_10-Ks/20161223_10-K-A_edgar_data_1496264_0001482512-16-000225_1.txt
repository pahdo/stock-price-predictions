Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
    
  Our system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our management, including the undersigned Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  . In conducting its assessment, management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission on Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of   December 31, 2015  , our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
    
  Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
    
  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, as stated in their report appearing on page F-2, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
  Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. 

We have audited Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  In our opinion, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on     the COSO criteria  . 
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. as of   December 31, 2015   and     2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended     December 31, 2015  , and our report dated   February 26, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
  Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (the  Company ), as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2015  . Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.  
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
    
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2015   in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  
    
  As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for reporting discontinued operations effective January 1, 2014. 
    
    We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated   February 26, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  The Partners of Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ), as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2015  . Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Operating Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.  
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Operating Partnership at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2015   in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  
    
    As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Operating Partnership changed its method for reporting discontinued operations effective January 1, 2014.

1. Organization 
    
  Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (which is referred to in these financial statements as the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) is a Maryland corporation formed on November 9, 2009 that did not have any meaningful operating activity until the consummation of our initial public offering and the related acquisition of our predecessor and certain other entities on June 29, 2010 ( IPO ).   
    
  Since the completion of the IPO, the concurrent private placement, and the related formation transactions, we have been a fully integrated, self-administered, and self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ). Through our controlling interest in Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. ( our operating partnership  or the  Operating Partnership  and is also referred to in these financial statements as the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop real estate, consisting primarily of office and media and entertainment properties.   On April 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the EOP Northern California Portfolio ( EOP Acquisition ) from Blackstone Real Estate Partners V and VI ( Blackstone ). The EOP Acquisition consisted of   26   high-quality office assets totaling approximately   8.2   million square feet, and   two   development parcels, located throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto, Silicon Valley and North San Jose submarkets. The total consideration paid for the EOP Acquisition before certain credits, proration, and closing costs included a cash payment of   $1.75 billion   and an aggregate of   63,474,791   shares of common stock of the Company and common units in the Operating Partnership.  See Note 3,  Investment in Real Estate  for additional details.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we owned a portfolio of   54   office properties and   two   media and entertainment properties. These properties are located in California and the Pacific Northwest.  

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and all of our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include the accounts of the Operating Partnership, and all wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Any reference to the number of properties and square footage are unaudited and outside the scope of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm s audit of the Company s financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( PCAOB ). 
    
  Certain amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,   Interest Imputation of Interest   ( ASU 2015-03 ). The Company has reclassified    $5.4 million   of deferred financing fees from an asset to a reduction in the carrying amount of the Company s notes payable. In accordance with ASU 2015-15,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at 18 June 2015 EITF Meeting,   deferred financing fees of   $3.3 million   related to the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and undrawn term loans are included in Prepaid expenses and other assets within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties, its accrued liabilities, and its performance-based equity compensation awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.

Investment in Real Estate Properties 
    
  Acquisitions 
    
  When the Company acquires properties that are considered business combinations, the purchase price is allocated to various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components include but are not limited to land, building and improvements, intangible assets related to above-and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year, within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  The Company assesses fair value based on level 2 and level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, which includes estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.  
    
  The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. The fair value of acquired  above-and below-  market leases is estimated cash flow projections utilizing discount rates that reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with below-market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes estimates of lost rents at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.  Acquisition-related expenses associated with acquisition of operating properties are expensed in the period incurred. 
    
    Cost Capitalization 
    
  The Company capitalizes direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate project. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits, office rent, and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities are also capitalized and allocated to the projects to which they relate. Capitalized personnel costs were approximately   $7.3 million   and   $3.1 million   for the   years   ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Interest is capitalized on the construction in progress at a rate equal to the Company s weighted average cost of debt. Capitalized interest was approximately   $6.5 million   and   $6.9 million   for the   years   ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Construction and development costs are capitalized while substantial activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. The Company considers a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements but no later than   one   year after cessation of major construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are expensed as they are incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as they are incurred. 
    
    Operating Properties 
    
  The properties are generally carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of   39   years for building and improvements,   15   years for land improvements,   five   or   seven   years for furniture and fixtures and equipment, and over the shorter of asset life or life of the lease for tenant improvements. Above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to revenue over the remaining non-cancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if applicable. Other in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable lease term. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale.

Held for sale 
    
  The Company classifies properties as held for sale when certain criteria set forth in Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 360,   Property, Plant, and Equipment,   are met. At the time a property is classified as held for sale, the Company reclassifies its assets and liabilities to held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented and cease recognizing depreciation expense. Properties held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.  At   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company classified   one   property as held for sale.  
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  The Company assesses the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with GAAP. Impairment losses are recorded on real estate assets held for investment when indicators of impairment are present and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amount. The Company recognizes impairment losses to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the properties. The Company recorded no impairment charges during the   years   ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions. The Company s goodwill balance as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, was   $8.8 million  . We do not amortize this asset but instead analyze it on an annual basis for impairment.   No   impairment indicators have been noted during the   years   ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand and in banks, plus all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.  
    
  The Company maintains some of its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, may exceed the federally insured limit. No losses have been experienced related to such accounts. 
    
  Restricted Cash 
    
  Restricted cash consists of amounts held by lenders to provide for future real estate taxes and insurance expenditures, repairs and capital improvements reserves, general and other reserves and security deposits. 
    
  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  Accounts receivable consist of amounts due for monthly rents and other charges. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. The Company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of uncollectible accounts and the Company s historical collection experience. The Company recognizes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and the Company s historical experience. Historical experience has been within management s expectations. The Company recognized   $0.2   million,   $(0.1)   million and   $1.0   million of bad debt (recovery) expense for the   years   ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
    
  The following table represents the Company s accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts as of:

Straight line rent receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  For straight-line rent amounts, the Company s assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease. The Company evaluates the collectability of straight line rent receivable based on length of time the related rental receivables are past due, the current business environment and the Company s historical experience.  
    
  The following table represents the Company s straight  -  line rent receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts as of: 

Notes Receivable 
    
  On August 19, 2014, the Company entered into a loan participation agreement for a loan with a maximum principal of   $140.0 million  . The Company s share was   23.77%  , or   $33.3 million  . The receivable under this agreement was classified as a Note Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Note Receivable is secured by a real estate property and bears interest at   11.0%   and matures on August 22, 2016. Interest is payable monthly with the principal due at maturity. The Company received a   $0.4 million   commitment fee as a result of this transaction. The balance as of   December 31, 2015  , net of the accretion of commitment fee, was   $28.7 million  . 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  The Company recognizes rental revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to: 

whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; 

whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; 

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and 

whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease. 
       
  Certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized only after the contingency has been removed (when the related thresholds are achieved), which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received. 
    
  Other property-related revenue is revenue that is derived from the tenants  use of lighting, equipment rental, parking, power, HVAC and telecommunications (telephone and internet). Other property-related revenue is recognized when these items are provided. 
    
  Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Tables in thousands, except square footage and share data) 

The Company recognizes gains on sales of properties upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when (i) the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and (iv) other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met. 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the respective loans and are reported net of accumulated amortization as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014   in the Notes payable, net and Prepaid expenses and other assets line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15.     
    
  Interest Rate Contracts 
    
  The Company manages interest rate risk associated with borrowings by entering into interest rate contracts. The Company recognizes all interest rate contracts on the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis at fair value. Interest rate contracts that are not effective hedges are adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value are reflected as income or expense. If the interest rate contract is an effective hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of equity. The ineffective portion of an interest rate contract s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.  
    
  The Company held    seven   and   three   interest rate contracts as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, all of which have been accounted for as effective cash flow hedges.  
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
   The Company recognizes the expense for the fair value of equity-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718,   Compensation Stock Compensation   (referred to as ASC Topic 718). Grants of  restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units under the Company s equity incentive award plans are accounted for under ASC Topic 718. The Company s compensation committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs. 
       
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s property-owning subsidiaries are limited liability companies and are treated as pass-through entities or disregarded entities (or, in the case of the entity that owns the 1455 Market Street property, a REIT) for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly,   no   provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the activities of these entities. 
    
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) commencing with the Company s taxable year ended December 31, 2010.  The Company believes that the Company has operated in a manner that has allowed the Company to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and the Company intends to continue operating in such manner.  To qualify as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to the Company s stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.  
    
  Provided that the Company continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and is unable to avail itself of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of the Company s taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, the Company would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which the Company loses its qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances the Company would be entitled to this statutory relief.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Tables in thousands, except square footage and share data) 

The Company has elected, together with   one   of the Company s subsidiaries, to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) for federal income tax purposes. Certain activities that the Company may undertake, such as non-customary services for the Company s tenants and holding assets that the Company cannot hold directly, will be conducted by a TRS. A TRS is subject to federal and, where applicable, state income taxes on its net income. The Company's TRS did not have significant tax provisions or deferred income tax items for 2015, 2014, 2013, or 2012. 
    
  The Company is subject to the statutory requirements of the states in which it conducts business. 
    
  The Company periodically evaluates its tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company has not established a liability for uncertain tax positions. 
    
  The Company and its TRS file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state and local jurisdictions. The Company and its TRS are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2011. Generally, the Company has assessed its tax positions for all open years, which include 2011 to 2015, and concluded that there are no material uncertainties to be recognized. 
    
  Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 

Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
       
  When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the Company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When the Company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the Company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, the Company uses several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establishes a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. 
    
  Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 
    
  The Company considers the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market: (i) there are few recent transactions, (ii) price quotations are not based on current information, (iii) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets), (iv) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability, (v) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with the Company s estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability, (vi) there  
  
   F- 23 

    Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Tables in thousands, except square footage and share data) 

is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread, (vii) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities, and (viii) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market). 
    
  The Company considers the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions: (i) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions, (ii) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant, (iii) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced), and (iv) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.     
    
  The Company s interest rate contract agreements are classified as Level 2 and their fair value is derived from estimated values obtained from observable market data for similar instruments. 
    
  Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   seven   interest rate contracts that were in a net asset position. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Literature 
       
  Changes to GAAP are established by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), in the form of ASUs. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. Recently issued ASUs not listed below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s  consolidated financial statements, because either the ASU is not applicable or the impact is expected to be immaterial.  
    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases.   ASU 2016-02 requires all lessees to record a lease liability at lease inception, with a corresponding right of use asset, except for short-term leases. Lessor accounting will not be fundamentally changed. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscals years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact on Company s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The guidance specifically notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. This update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2017 and is currently assessing the impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception. Public business entities may elect to adopt the amendments as of the original effective date; however, adoption is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  On February 18, 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (   Topic 810   ): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   , to amend the accounting guidance for consolidation. The standard simplifies the current guidance for consolidation and reduces the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167. Additionally, the standard places more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. This update is effective for all entities for reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2016, and the adoption of the guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . This update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern

  A summary of the activity of our investment in real estate including investment in real estate held for sale (Bayhill, First Financial and Tierrasanta) is as follows: 

Acquisitions 
    
  When the Company acquires properties that are considered business combinations, the purchase price is allocate to various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.  The Company assesses fair value based on level 2 and level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, which includes estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. Acquisition-related expenses are expensed in the period incurred. The results of operations of each acquisition have been included in the Company s financial statements from the date of acquisition.  
       
  During 2015, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which amends ASC 805,   Business Combinations  . 
    
  On April 1, 2015, the Company completed the EOP Acquisition which consisted of   26   high-quality office assets totaling approximately   8.2 million   square feet and   two   development parcels located throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto Silicon Valley and North San Jose submarkets. The total consideration paid before certain credits, proration, and closing costs was a cash payment equal to   $1.75 billion   (financed with proceeds received from the Company s January 2015 common equity offering and $  1.3 billion   of new term debt), an aggregate of   63,474,791   shares of our common of the Company and common units in the Operating Partnership.

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities 
       
  New Term Loan Agreement 
    
  On November 17, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into a new term loan credit agreement (the  New Term Loan Agreement ) with a group of lenders for an unsecured   $175.0   million   five  -year delayed draw term loan with a maturity date of November 2020 ( 5-Year Term Loan due November 2020 ) and an unsecured   $125.0   million   seven  -year delayed draw term loan with a maturity date of November 2022 ( 7-Year Term Loan due November 2022 ). These term loans were undrawn as of December 31, 2015.   
    
  Interest on the New Term Loan Agreement is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable LIBOR margin or (ii) a specified base rate plus the applicable base rate margin, dependent on the Operating Partnership s leverage ratio. The applicable LIBOR margin will range from   1.30%   to   2.20%   for the 5-year Term Loan due November 2020, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Term Loan Agreement) and   1.60%   to   2.55%   for the 7-Year Term Loan due November 2022, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Term Loan Agreement).  Beginning on February 13, 2016, each term loan is subject to an unused commitment fee of   .20%  . 
    
  The Operating Partnership has the right to terminate or reduce unused commitments under either term loan in the New Term Loan Agreement without penalty or premium. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Operating Partnership has the right to increase the availability of either or both of the term loans so long as the aggregate commitments under both term loans do not exceed   $475.0   million.  
    
  If the Company obtains a credit rating for the Company s senior unsecured long term indebtedness, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to change the interest rate. During 2015, our senior unsecured long term indebtedness was assigned an investment grade rating. The Company has not made the credit rating election.  
    
  A R Credit Agreement 
    
  The Operating Partnership maintains and periodically amends its  A R Credit Agreement with a group of lenders.  On April 1, 2015, the agreement governing the credit facility was amended and restated  to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the A R Credit Agreement     with a   one  -year extension option, (ii) increase available revolving credit from   $300.0   million to   $400.0   million, (iii) increase the   five  -year term loan facility from   $150.0   million to   $550.0   million and extended the maturity

date to April 2020 ( 5-Year Term Loan due April 2020) and (iv) add a   $350.0   million seven-year term loan with a maturity date of April 2022 ( 7-Year Term Loan due April 2022 ). On November 17, 2015, the Operating Partnership amended and restated the Credit Facility ( Amended and Restated Credit Facility ) to align certain terms therein with the less restrictive terms of the New Term Loan Agreement. The 5-Year Term Loan due 2020 and the 7-Year Term Loan due 2022 were used towards the EOP Acquisition. The A R Credit Agreement is available for other purposes, including for payment of pre-development and development costs incurred in connection with properties owned by the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary, to finance capital expenditures and the repayment of indebtedness of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, to provide for general working capital needs of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and for the general corporate purposes of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. 
    
  Interest on the Amended Credit Facility is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable LIBOR margin or (ii) a specified base rate plus the applicable base rate margin, dependent on the Operating Partnership s leverage ratio. The applicable LIBOR margin will range from   1.15%   to   1.85%   (previously   1.15%   to   1.55%  ) for the A R Credit Agreement,   1.30%   to   2.20%   (previously   1.30%   to   1.90%  ) for the 5-year Term Loan due April 2020, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility) and   1.60%   to   2.55%   for the 7-year Term Loan due April 2022, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility).  The Amended Facility requires a facility fee in an amount equal to   0.20%   or   0.35%   of the Operating Partnership s revolving credit commitments depending on the Operating Partnership s leverage ratio. Unused amounts under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility are not subject to a separate fee. 
    
  Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender commitments, the Operating Partnership may increase the availability of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility so long as the aggregate commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility do not exceed   $2.0   billion. 
    
  If the Company obtains a credit rating for the Company s senior unsecured long-term indebtedness, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to change the interest rate and facility fee. During 2015, our senior unsecured long term indebtedness was assigned an investment grade rating. The Company has not made the credit rating election.  
    
  Unsecured Term Loan Facility 
    
  On April 1, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into a new credit agreement with a group of lenders for an unsecured   $550.0   million two-year term loan credit facility (   2  -Year Term Loan ). The 2-Year Term Loan was fully drawn and repaid during 2015.  Amounts paid down are no longer available for re-borrowing. The Company recognized   $851   thousand of  costs related to an early extinguishment of debt recognized in Interest Expense within the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  The Operating Partnership continues to be the borrower under the New Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, and the Company and all subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties will continue to provide guaranties unless the Company obtains and maintains a credit rating of at least BBB- from S P or Baa3 from Moody s, in which case such guaranties are not required except under limited circumstances.   
    
  Guaranteed Senior Notes 
    
  On November 16, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) with various purchasers, which provides for the private placement of   $425.0   million of senior guaranteed notes by the Operating Partnership, of which (i)   $110.0   million are designated as   4.34%   Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2, 2023 (the  Series A Notes ), (ii)   $259.0   million are designated as   4.69%   Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2025 (the  Series B Notes ) and (iii)   $56.0   million are designated as   4.79%   Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2027 (the  Series C Notes,  and collectively with the Series A Notes and Series B Notes, the  Notes ). The Notes were issued on December 16, 2015 and upon issuance, the Notes pay interest semi-annually on the 16th day of June and December in each year until their respective maturities. 
    
  The Operating Partnership may prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than   5%   of the aggregate principal amount of any series of the Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at   100%   of the principal amount so prepaid plus a make-whole premium.     
    
  The Operating Partnership s obligations under the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Subsidiaries of the Company will also issue unconditional guarantees upon the occurrence of certain conditions, including such

  Debt Covenants 
    
  The Company s ability to borrow under the New Term Loan Agreement, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, and the Note Purchase Agreement remains subject to ongoing compliance with financial and other covenants as defined in the respective agreements, including maintaining a leverage ratio (maximum of   0.60  :  1.00  ), unencumbered leverage ratio (maximum of   0.60  :  1.00  ), fixed charge coverage ratio (minimum of   1.50  :  1.00  ), secured indebtedness leverage ratio (maximum of   0.55  :  1.00  ), and unsecured interest coverage ratio (minimum   2.00  :  1.00  ).

Furthermore, the Company agreed to guarantee the completion of the construction improvements including tenant improvements, as defined in the agreement, in the event of any default of the borrower. If the borrower fails to complete the remaining required work, the guarantor agrees to perform timely all of the completion obligations, as defined in the agreement.

At December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance was   $30.0   million, which results in a maximum guarantee amount for the principal under this loan of   $10.5   million. Furthermore, we agreed to guarantee the completion of the construction improvements, including tenant improvements, as defined in the agreement, in the event of any default of the borrower.

8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 

Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
       
  When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the Company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When the Company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the Company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, the Company uses several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establishes a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources.

Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 
    
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Fair values for notes payable, notes receivable and interest rate contract assets and liabilities are estimates based on rates currently prevailing for similar instruments of similar maturities using Level 2 inputs.

Non-controlling Interests 
    
  Common units in the Operating Partnership 
    
  Common units in the Operating Partnership consisted of   56,296,315   common units of partnership interests, or common units, not owned by us. Common units and shares of our common stock have essentially the same economic characteristics, as they share equally in the total net income or loss distributions of the Operating Partnership. Investors who own common units have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem any or all of their common units for cash equal to the then-current market value of one share of common stock or, at our election, issue shares of our common stock in exchange for common units on a one-for-one basis. In April 2015, the Company issued   54,848,480   of common units to Blackstone as consideration for the EOP Acquisition. In addition,   one   of our common unitholders required us to redeem   934,728   common units and the Company elected, in accordance with our limited partnership agreement, to issue shares of our common stock in exchange for the common units to satisfy the redemption notice. Accordingly, our outstanding common units increased from   2,382,563   at   December 31, 2014   to   56,296,315   at   December 31, 2015  .

Taxability of Dividends 
    
  Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders, may differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of loss on extinguishment of debt, revenue recognition, and compensation expense and in the basis of depreciable assets and estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation. 
    
  The Company s dividends related to its common stock (CUSIP #444097109) and described above under  Dividends,  will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as follows (unaudited):

Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Board of Directors awards restricted shares to non-employee board members on an annual basis as part of such board members  annual compensation and to newly elected non-employee board members in accordance with our Board of Directors compensation program. The share-based awards are generally issued in the second quarter, and the individual share awards vest in equal annual installments over the applicable service vesting period, which is   three years  .  
    
  In addition, the Board of Directors awards restricted shares to employees on an annual basis as part of the employees  annual compensation. The share-based awards are generally issued in the fourth quarter, and the individual share awards vest in equal annual installments over the applicable service vesting period, which is   three years  . Additionally these awards are subject to a   two  -year hold upon vesting if the employee is a named executive office. 
       
  The following table summarizes the restricted share activity for the   year   ended   December 31, 2015   and status of all unvested restricted share awards to our non-employee board members and employees at   December 31, 2015  :

We recognize the total compensation expense for time-vested shares on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, which reflects an adjustment for awards with the   two  -year hold restriction in accordance with ASC 718. 
    
  Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. Outperformance Programs 
    
  In each of 2012,   2013  ,   2014   and   2015  , the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors adopted a Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. Outperformance Program (individually, the  2012 OPP ,     2013   OPP , the    2014   OPP  and the    2015   OPP  and, together, the  OPPs ). Participants in the 2012 OPP,   2013   OPP,   2014   OPP and   2015   OPP may earn, in the aggregate, up to   $10 million  ,   $11 million  ,   $12 million   and   $15 million  , respectively, of stock-settled awards based on our Total stockholder Return ( TSR ), for the   three  -year period beginning January 1 of the year in which the applicable OPP was adopted and ending December 31 of 2014,   2015  ,   2016  , or   2017  , respectively.  
    
  Under each OPP, participants will be entitled to share in a performance pool with a value, subject to the applicable dollar-denominated cap described above, equal to the sum of: (i)   4%   of the amount by which our TSR during the applicable performance period exceeds   9%   simple annual TSR (the  absolute TSR component ), plus (ii)   4%   of the amount by which our TSR during the applicable performance period exceeds that of the SNL Equity REIT Index (determined on a percentage basis that is then multiplied by the sum of (A) our market capitalization on that date, plus (B) the aggregate per share dividend over the applicable performance period through such date) (the  relative TSR component ), except that the relative TSR component will be reduced on a linear basis from   100%   to   zero percent   for absolute TSR ranging from   7%   to   zero percent   simple annual TSR over the applicable performance period. In addition, the relative TSR component may be a negative value equal to   4%   of the amount by which we underperform the SNL Equity REIT Index by more than   3%   per year during the applicable performance period (if any).  
    
  At the end of the applicable   three  -year performance period, participants who remain employed with the Company are paid their percentage interest in the bonus pool as stock awards based on the value of our common stock at the end of the performance period. Half of each such participant s bonus pool interest is paid in fully vested shares of our common stock and the other half is paid in RSUs that vest in equal annual installments over the   two   years immediately following the applicable performance period (based on continued employment) and which carry tandem dividend equivalent rights. However, if the applicable performance period is terminated in connection with a change in control, OPP awards will be paid entirely in fully vested shares of our common stock immediately prior to the change in control. In addition to these share/RSU payments, each OPP award entitles its holder to a cash payment equal to the aggregate dividends that would have been paid during the applicable performance period on the total number of shares and RSUs ultimately issued or granted in respect of such OPP award, had such shares and RSUs been outstanding throughout the performance period.

If a participant s employment is terminated without  cause,  for  good reason  or due to the participant s death or disability during the applicable performance period (referred to as qualifying terminations), the participant will be paid his or her OPP award at the end of the performance period entirely in fully vested shares (except for the performance period dividend equivalent, which will be paid in cash at the end of the performance period). Any such payment will be pro-rated in the case of a termination without  cause  or for  good reason  by reference to the participant s period of employment during the applicable performance period. If we experience a change in control or a participant experiences a qualifying termination of employment, in either case, after the end of the applicable performance period, any unvested RSUs that remain outstanding will accelerate and vest in full upon such event. 
    
  The cost of the 2012 OPP,   2013   OPP,   2014   OPP and   2015   OPP (approximately   $3.5 million  ,   $4.1 million  ,   $3.2 million   and   $4.3 million  , respectively, subject to a forfeiture adjustment equal to   6%   of the total cost) will be amortized through the final vesting period under a graded vesting expense recognition schedule. The costs were valued in accordance with ASC 718, utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the performance vesting conditions being satisfied. The Monte Carlo simulation used a statistical formula underlying the Black-Scholes and binomial formulas and such simulation was run 100,000 times. For each simulation, the payoff is calculated at the settlement date, which is then discounted to the award date at a risk-free interest rate. The average of the values over all simulations is the expected value of the unit on the award date. Assumptions used in the valuations included (1) factors associated with the underlying performance of the Company s stock price and total stockholder return over the term of the performance awards, including total stock return volatility and risk-free interest. and (2) factors associated with the relative performance of the Company s stock price and total stockholder return when compared to the SNL Equity REIT Index. The valuation was performed in a risk-neutral framework, so no assumption was made with respect to an equity risk premium. The fair value of the OPP awards is based on the sum of: (1) the present value of the expected payoff to the awards on the measurement date, if the TSR over the applicable measurement period exceeds performance hurdles of the absolute and the relative TSR components; and (2) the present value of the distributions payable on the awards. The ultimate reward realized on account of the OPP awards by the holders of the awards is contingent on the TSR achieved on the measurement date, both in absolute terms and relative to the TSR of the SNL Equity REIT Index. The per unit fair value of each  2012 OPP award,   2013   OPP award,   2014   OPP award and   2015   OPP award was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions in the Monte Carlo valuation: 

The following table presents the classification and amount recognized for stock compensation related to the Company's OPP plans and restricted stock awards:     

As of December 31, 2015, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled   $27.3 million  , before the impact of forfeitures, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   3.0   years.  
    
  One-Time Retention Awards 
    
  On December 29, 2015, the Company awarded a one-time grant of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that are intended to align the interests of the participants with those of the Company s stockholders and to motivate them to achieve specified performance hurdles.

The restricted stock retention awards vest in equal   25%   installments on January 1 of each of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to the participant s continued employment. The RSU retention awards are eligible to vest in substantially equal annual installments on January 1 of each of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, based on the achievement of one of the two following annual performance goals for each calendar year during the four-year performance period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2019, subject to the participant s continued employment through each vesting date: (1) achievement of an annual TSR equal to at least   7%   for the applicable calendar year, or (2) achievement of a TSR that exceeds the total shareholder return for the MSCI U.S. REIT Index for the applicable calendar year. In addition, to the extent the RSU retention award is unvested as of the end of calendar year 2019, it will vest in full on January 1, 2020 if the Company s TSR during the entire performance period is equal to at least   28%  , subject to the participant s continued employment.

The total consideration paid for the EOP Acquisition before certain credits, proration, and closing costs included a cash payment of    $1.75   billion and an aggregate of   63,474,791   shares of common stock of the Company and common units in the Operating Partnership.  
    
  The Stockholders Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2015, in connection with the closing of the acquisition as described below, the Company entered into a Stockholders Agreement (the  Stockholders Agreement ) by and among the Company, the Operating Partnership, Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. ( BREA ) and the other affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the  Sponsor Stockholders ). The Stockholders Agreement sets forth various arrangements and restrictions with respect to the governance of the Company and certain rights of the Sponsor Stockholders with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company and common units of in the Operating Partnership received by the Sponsor Stockholders in connection with the Acquisition (the  Equity Consideration ). 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) has expanded from   eight   to   eleven   directors, and   three   director nominees designated by the Sponsor Stockholders to the Board have been elected.   Subject to certain exceptions, the Board will continue to include the Sponsor Stockholders  designees in its slate of nominees, and will continue to recommend such nominees, and will otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the vote of the Company s stockholders to elect to the Board the slate of nominees which includes those designated by the Sponsor Stockholders. The Sponsor Stockholders will have the right to designate three nominees for so long as the Sponsor Stockholders continue to beneficially own,  
  
   F- 45

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Tables in thousands, except square footage and share data) 

in the aggregate, greater than   50%   of the Equity Consideration. If the Sponsor Stockholders  beneficial ownership of the Equity Consideration decreases, then the number of director nominees that the Sponsor Stockholders will have the right to designate will be reduced (i) to   two  , if the Sponsor Stockholders beneficially own greater than or equal to   30%   but less than or equal to   50%   of the Equity Consideration and (ii) to   one  , if the Sponsor Stockholders beneficially own greater than or equal to  15%   but less than   30%   of the Equity Consideration. The Board nomination rights of the Sponsor Stockholders will terminate at such time as the Sponsor Stockholders beneficially own less than   15%   of the Equity Consideration or upon written notice of waiver or termination of such rights by the Sponsor Stockholders. So long as the Sponsor Stockholders retain the right to designate at least one nominee to the Board, the Company will not be permitted to increase the total number of directors comprising the Board to more than   twelve   persons without the prior written consent of the Sponsor Stockholders. 
    
  For so long as the Sponsor Stockholders have the right to designate at least   two   director nominees, subject to the satisfaction of applicable NYSE independence requirements, the Sponsor Stockholders will also be entitled to appoint   one   such nominee then serving on the Board to serve on each committee of the Board (other than certain specified committees). 
    
  The Stockholders Agreement also includes: (i) standstill provisions, which require that, until such time as the Sponsor Stockholders beneficially own shares of common stock representing less than   10%   of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, the Sponsor Stockholders and BREA are restricted from, among other things, acquiring additional equity or debt securities (other than non-recourse debt and certain other debt) of the Company and its subsidiaries without the Company s prior written consent; and (ii) transfer restriction provisions, which restrict the Sponsor Stockholders from transferring any of the Equity Consideration (including shares of common stock issued to the Sponsor Stockholders in exchange of common units pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement) (collectively, the  Covered Securities ) until November 1, 2015 (other than pursuant to certain specified exceptions), at which time such transfer restrictions will cease to be applicable to   50%   of the Covered Securities. The transfer restrictions applicable to the remaining   50%   of the Covered Securities will cease to be applicable on March 1, 2016 (or, if earlier,   30   days following written notice of waiver or termination by the Sponsor Stockholders of their board nomination rights described above). If, prior to November 1, 2015, the Sponsor Stockholders provide written notice waiving and terminating their director nomination rights described above, the transfer restrictions applicable to all the Covered Securities will cease to be applicable on November 1, 2015 and, if such written notice of waiver and termination is provided after November 1, 2015, then the transfer restrictions will cease to be applicable as of the earlier of March 1, 2016 and   30   days following the Issuer s receipt of such written notice. 
    
  In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, until April 1, 2017, the Company is required to obtain the prior written consent of the Sponsor Stockholders prior to the issuance of common equity securities by it or any of its subsidiaries other than up to an aggregate of   16,843,028   shares of common stock (and certain other exceptions). 
    
  Further, until such time as the Sponsor Stockholders beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than   15%   of the Equity Consideration, each Sponsor Stockholder will cause all common stock held by it to be voted by proxy (i) in favor of all persons nominated to serve as directors of the Company by the Board (or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee thereof) in any slate of nominees which includes the Sponsor Stockholders  nominees and (ii) otherwise in accordance with the recommendation of the Board (to the extent the recommendation is not inconsistent with the rights of the Sponsor Stockholders under the Stockholders Agreement) with respect to any other action, proposal or other matter to be voted upon by the Company s stockholders, other than in connection with (A) any proposed transaction relating to a change of control of the Company, (B) any amendments to the Company s charter or bylaws, (C) any other transaction that the Company submits to a vote of its stockholders pursuant to Section 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or (D) any other transaction that the Company submits to a vote of its stockholders for approval. 
    
  As required by the Stockholders Agreement, the Company has agreed that the Sponsor Stockholders and certain of their affiliates may engage in investments, strategic relationships or other business relationships with entities engaged in other business, including those that compete with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and will have no obligation to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company, even if the opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Company, could be undertaken by the Company. As required by the Stockholders Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law, the Company has renounced any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any such investment, opportunity or activity presented to or developed by the Sponsor Stockholders, their nominees for election as directors and certain of their affiliates, other than any opportunity expressly offered to a director nominated at the direction of the Sponsor Stockholders in his or her capacity as a director of the Company. 
    
  Further, without the prior written consent of the Sponsor Stockholders, the Company may not amend certain provisions of its Bylaws relating to the ability of its directors and officers to engage in other business or to adopt qualification for directors other than those in effect as of the date of the Stockholders Agreement or as are generally applicable to all directors, respectively.

The Stockholders Agreement also includes certain provisions that, together, are intended to enhance the liquidity of common units to be held by the Sponsor Stockholders. 
    
  Redemption Rights of Sponsor Stockholders 
    
  Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the Company (in its capacity as the general partner of the Operating Partnership) has waived the   14  -month holding period set forth in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (as defined below) before the Sponsor Stockholders may require the Operating Partnership to redeem the common units and grants certain additional rights to the Sponsor Stockholders in connection with such redemptions. Among other things, the Company generally must give the Sponsor Stockholder notice before 9:30 a.m. Eastern time on the business day after the business day on which a Sponsor Stockholder gives the Company notice of redemption of any common units of the Company s election, in its sole and absolute discretion, to either (A) cause the Operating Partnership to redeem all of the tendered common units in exchange for a cash amount per common units equal to the value of   one   share of common stock on the date that the Sponsor Stockholder provided its notice of redemption, calculated in accordance with and subject to adjustment as provided in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, or (B) subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company s stock set forth in its charter, acquire all of the tendered common units from the Sponsor Stockholder in exchange for shares of common stock, based on an exchange ratio of   one   share of common stock for each OP Unit, subject to adjustment as provided in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement. If the Company fails to timely provide such notice, the Company will be deemed to have elected to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem all such tendered common units in exchange for shares of common stock. 
    
  The Company may also elect to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem all common units tendered by a Sponsor Stockholder with the proceeds of a public or private offering of common stock under certain circumstances as discussed more fully below.  
    
  Restrictions on Transfer of Common Units by Sponsor Stockholders 
    
  Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the Company (in its capacity as the general partner of the Operating Partnership) has waived the   14  -month holding period set forth in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement before the Sponsor Stockholders may transfer any common units, and has agreed to admit any permitted transferee of a Sponsor Stockholder as a substituted limited partner of the Operating Partnership upon the satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement. Nevertheless, the Covered Securities are subject to the transfer restrictions described above. 
    
  Amendments to the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement 
    
  The Stockholders Agreement prohibits the Company, without the prior written consent of the Sponsor Stockholders, from amending certain provisions of the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement in a manner adverse in any respect to the Sponsor Stockholders (in their capacity as limited partners of the Operating Partnership), or to add any new provision to the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement that would have a substantially identical effect or from taking any action that is intended to or otherwise would have a substantially identical effect. 
    
    Ownership Limits 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the Equity Consideration, the Board has granted to the Sponsor Stockholders and certain of their affiliates a limited exception to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of common stock set forth in the Company s charter (the  Charter ) that will allow the Sponsor Stockholders and such affiliates to own, directly, or indirectly, in the aggregate, up to   17,707,056   shares of common stock (the  Excepted Holder Limit ). The grant of this exception is conditioned upon the receipt of various representations and covenants set forth in the Sponsor Stockholders  request delivered on April 1, 2015, confirming, among other things, that neither the Sponsor Stockholders nor certain of their affiliates may own, directly or indirectly, (i) more than   9.9%   of the interests in a tenant of the Company (other than a tenant of the 1455 Market Street office property) or (ii) more than   5.45%   of the interests in a tenant of the 1455 Market Street office property, in each case subject to certain exceptions that may reduce such ownership percentage, but not below   2%   The request also includes representations intended to confirm that the Sponsor Stockholders  and certain of their affiliates  ownership of common stock will not cause the Company to otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT. 

F- 47

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Tables in thousands, except square footage and share data) 

The Board will provide the exception to the Sponsor Stockholders and certain of their affiliates until (i) any such Sponsor Stockholder or affiliate violates any of the representations or covenants in the Sponsor Stockholders  request or (ii) (a) any such Sponsor Stockholder or affiliate owns, directly or indirectly, more than the applicable ownership percentage (as described above) of the interests in any tenant(s) and (b) the maximum rental income expected to be produced by such tenant(s) exceeds (x)   0.5%   of the Company s gross income (in the case of tenants other than tenants of the 1455 Market Street office property) or (y)  0.5%   of the 1455 Market Street Joint Venture s gross income (in the case of tenants of the 1455 Market Street office property) for any taxable year (the  Rent Threshold ), at which time the number of shares of common stock that the Sponsor Stockholders and certain of their affiliates may directly or indirectly own will be reduced to the number of shares of common stock which would result in the amount of rent from such tenant(s) (that would be treated as related party rents under certain tax rules) representing no more than the Rent Threshold. 
    
  In addition, due to the Sponsor Stockholders  ownership of common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and the application of certain constructive ownership rules, the Operating Partnership will be considered to own the common stock that is directly or indirectly owned by the Sponsor Stockholders and certain of their affiliates. For this reason, the Board has also granted the Operating Partnership an exception to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of common stock set forth in the Charter. 
    
  The Registration Rights Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2015, in connection with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated April 1, 2015 (the  Registration Rights Agreement ) by and among the Company and the Sponsor Stockholders. The Registration Rights Agreement provides for customary registration rights with respect to the Equity Consideration, including the following: 

Shelf Registration  . On October 27, 2015, the Company filed a resale shelf registration statement covering the Sponsor Stockholders  shares of common stock received as part of the Equity Consideration as well as shares issuable upon redemption of common units received as part of the Equity Consideration, and the Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause such resale shelf registration statement to become effective prior to the termination of the transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement (as described above). 

Demand Registrations  . Beginning November 1, 2015 (or earlier if transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement are terminated earlier), the Sponsor Stockholders may cause the Company to register their shares if the foregoing resale shelf registration statement is not effective or if the Company is not eligible to file a shelf registration statement. 

Qualified Offerings  . Any registered offerings requested by the Sponsor Stockholders that are to an underwriter on a firm commitment basis for reoffering and resale to the public, in an offering that is a  bought deal  with one or more investment banks or in a block trade with a broker-dealer will be (subject to certain specified exceptions): (i) no more frequent than once in any   120  -day period, (ii) subject to underwriter lock-ups from prior offerings then in effect, and (iii) subject to a minimum offering size of   $50.0 million  . 

Piggy-Back Rights.   Beginning November 1, 2015 (or earlier if transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement are terminated earlier), the Sponsor Stockholders will be permitted to, among other things, participate in offerings for the Company s account or the account of any other security holder of the Company (other than in certain specified cases). If underwriters advise that the success of a proposed offering would be significantly and adversely affected by the inclusion of all securities in an offering initiated by the Company for the Company s own account, then the securities proposed to be included by the Sponsor Stockholders together with other stockholders exercising similar piggy-back rights are cut back first. 
       
    Limited Partnership Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2015, in connection with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, entered into the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership dated April 1, 2015 along with the Sponsor Stockholders and the other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. The principal changes to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended and as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, made by the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement were to add the provisions described below. The Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement was amended and restated subsequently on December 17, 2015.

Restrictions on Mergers, Sales, Transfers and Other Significant Transactions of the Company 
    
  Prior to the date on which the Sponsor Stockholders and any of their affiliates own less than   9.8%   of the Equity Consideration, the Company may not consummate any of (a) a merger, consolidation or other combination of the Company s or the Operating Partnership s assets with another person, (b) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating Partnership, (c) sell all or substantially all of the Company s assets not in the ordinary course of the Operating Partnership s business or (d) a reclassification, recapitalization or change in the Company s outstanding equity securities (other than in connection with a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, change in par value, increase in authorized shares, designation or issuance of new classes of equity securities or any event that does not require the approval of the Company s stockholders), in each case, which is submitted to the holders of common stock for approval, unless such transaction is also approved by the partners of the Operating Partnership holding common units on a  pass through  basis, which, in effect, affords the limited partners of the Operating Partnership that hold common units the right to vote on such transaction as though such limited partners held the number of shares of common stock into which their common units were then exchangeable and voted together with the holders of the Company s outstanding common stock with respect to such transaction. 
    
  Stock Offering Funding of Redemption 
    
  If any Sponsor Stockholder or any of its affiliates who become limited partners of the Operating Partnership ( Specified Limited Partners ) delivers a notice of redemption with respect to common units that, if exchanged for common stock, would result in a violation of the Excepted Holder Limit (as defined below) or otherwise violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company s stock set forth in its charter and that have an aggregate value in excess of   $50.0 million   as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, then, if the Company is then eligible to register the offering of its securities on Form S-3 (or any successor form similar thereto), the Company may elect to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem such common units with the net proceeds from a public or private offering of the number of shares of common stock that would be deliverable in exchange for such common units but for the application of the Excepted Holder Limit and other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company s stock. If the Company elects to fund the redemption of any common units with such an offering, it will allow all Specified Limited Partners the opportunity to include additional common units held by such Specified Limited Partners in such redemption. 
       
  Blackstone Margin Loan  
    
  On December 31, 2015, the Company was informed by HPP BREP V Holdco A LLC, an affiliate of investment funds associated with or designated by The Blackstone Group L.P. that are common stockholders of the Company and limited partners of the Operating Partnership, that HPP BREP V Holdco A LLC ( Borrower ), has entered into (i) a Margin Loan Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) dated as of December 29, 2015 with the lenders party thereto (each, a  Lender  and, collectively, the  Lenders ) and the administrative agent party thereto and (ii) Pledge and Security Agreements dated as of December 31, 2015, in each case, between one of the Lenders, as secured party, and Borrower, as pledgor (the  Borrower Pledge Agreements ), and certain of HPP BREP V Holdco A LLC s affiliates (each, a  Holdco A Guarantor  and collectively, the  Holdco A Guarantors ) have each entered into (i) with each Lender, a Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of December 31, 2015 (each, a  Holdco A Guarantor Pledge Agreement  and, collectively with the Borrower Pledge Agreements, the  Pledge Agreements ) and (ii) with the administrative agent and the Lenders, a Guarantee dated as of December 31, 2015 of the Borrower s obligations under the Loan Agreement (each, a  Holdco A Guarantee  and collectively the  Holdco A Guarantees ). In addition, certain of HPP BREP V Holdco A LLC s other affiliates (each, a  Holdco B Guarantor  and collectively, the  Holdco B Guarantors ) have each entered into, with the administrative agent and the Lenders, a Guarantee dated as of December 31, 2015 of the Borrower s obligations under the Loan Agreement (each, a  Holdco B Guarantee  and, collectively with the Holdco A Guarantees, the Loan Agreement, and the Pledge Agreements, the  Loan Documents ). Each of the Borrower, the Holdco A Guarantors and the Holdco B Guarantors is affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Borrower has borrowed an aggregate of   $350.0   million under the Loan Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the pledge of Common Units by the Holdco B Guarantors referenced below, the Borrower may borrow up to an additional   $150.0   million on or after March 1, 2016. The scheduled maturity date of the loans under the Loan Agreement is December 31, 2017, which may be extended at the election of the Borrower until December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreements, to secure borrowings under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantors have collectively pledged   8,276,945   shares of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share ( Common Stock ) of the Company and   23,460,446   common units of partnership interest ( Common Units ) in Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P., as well as their respective rights under the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of April 1, 2015 by and among the Company and the holders listed on Schedule I thereto (the  Registration Rights Agreement ). In addition, the Holdco B Guarantors have agreed to pledge an additional

29,166,672   Common Units, and their respective rights under the Registration Rights Agreement, within   10   business days following March 1, 2016,     pursuant to pledge and security agreements substantially similar to the Pledge Agreements. 
    
  Upon the occurrence of certain events that are customary for this type of loan, the Lenders may exercise their rights to require the Borrower to pre-pay the loan proceeds, post additional collateral, or foreclose on, and dispose of, the pledged shares of Common Stock and pledged Common Units in accordance with the Loan Documents. 
    
  The Company did not independently verify the foregoing disclosure. In addition, the Company is not a party to the Loan Documents and has no obligations thereunder, but has delivered an Issuer Agreement to each of the Lenders in which it has, among other things, agreed to certain obligations relating to the pledged Common Stock and pledged Common Units and, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules, agreed not to take any actions that are intended to materially hinder or delay the exercise of any remedies with respect to the pledged Common Stock and pledged Common Units.  
   
  11. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal 
    
  From time to time, the Company is party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business. Management believes, based in part upon consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. As of   December 31, 2015  , the risk of material loss from such legal actions impacting the Company s financial condition or results from operations has been assessed as remote. 
    
  Concentrations 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the majority of the Company s properties were located in California, which exposes the Company to greater economic risks than if it owned a more geographically dispersed portfolio.  
    
  A significant portion of the Company's rental revenue is derived from tenants in the media, entertainment and technology industries. As of   December 31, 2015   approximately   15.8%   and   32.0%   of our rentable square feet were related to the media and entertainment and technology industries, respectively.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , our   15   largest tenants represented approximately   24.8%   of our rentable square feet.  During 2015, no single tenant accounted for more than   10%  . 
       
  Letters of Credit    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company has outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately   $3.3 million   under the unsecured revolving credit facility. The letters of credit are primarily related to utility company security deposit requirements.

    Bayhill disposition 
    
  On   January 14, 2016  , the Company sold its Bayhill office property for   $215.0 million   (before certain credits, prorations, and closing costs).   Proceeds received were used to partially paydown our unsecured revolving credit facility.  
    
  2013 OPP Plan Payout 
    
  On February 23, 2016, our compensation committee determined the final bonus pool under the Company's 2013 OPP Plan, and approved the grant of fully vested common stock and RSUs, which is an aggregate amount of   $11.0 million  , to the participants in accordance with the 2013 OPP. The RSUs will vest in equal annual installments on December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 based on continued employment, and carry tandem dividend equivalent rights.  If we experience a change in control or a participant experiences a qualifying termination of employment, in either case, any unvested RSUs that remain outstanding will accelerate and vest in full upon such event. The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of RSUs granted to each named executive officer: 

Obtained Board Approval For Share Repurchase Program 
    
  E  ffective January 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to 
  $100.0 million   of the Company s outstanding common stock. The program may be implemented at the Company s 
  discretion at any time for up to one year from the date of approval. Repurchases, if and when made, would be compliant 
  with the SEC s Rule 10b-18, and subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The 
  repurchase program serves as another capital allocation tool for the Company, a means to return capital to shareholders 
  from asset dispositions, which will be weighed against other potential investment opportunities.
