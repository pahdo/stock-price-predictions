NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1  .      Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
      
  Organization and Principles of Consolidation 
        
  We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Our operations are focused primarily on large scale, onshore liquids-rich resource plays in the United States. Our principal areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota, and the Uinta Basin of Utah. In addition, we have oil developments offshore China. 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to  Newfield,   we,   us,   our  or the  Company  are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries. 
    
  These unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state our financial position as of, and results of operations, for the periods presented. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all disclosures required for financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or cash flows for a full year. 
    
  These consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
     
  Risks and Uncertainties 
    
  As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce. Other risks and uncertainties that could affect us in the current commodity price environment include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, responsibility for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own, access to credit markets, regulatory risks and ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing impairment of our oil and gas properties. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Our most significant estimates are associated with the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the timing and amount of transfers of our unevaluated properties into our amortizable full cost pool, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the fair value of our derivative contracts. 
    
  Restructuring Costs 
    
  Restructuring costs include severance and related benefit costs, costs associated with abandoned office space, employee relocation costs and other associated costs. Employee severance and related benefit costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period, if any. Employee relocation costs are expensed as incurred. On the date a leased property ceases to be used, a liability for non-cancellable office-lease costs associated with restructuring is recognized and measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Fair value estimates include assumptions regarding estimated future sublease payments. These estimates could materially differ from actual results and may require revision to initial estimates of the liability. See Note   16  , "Restructuring Costs," for additional disclosures.

Reclassifications 
    
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not impact our net income (loss), stockholders' equity or cash flows. 
    
  Restricted Cash 
    
  Restricted cash consists of amounts held in escrow accounts to satisfy future plug and abandonment obligations for our China operations. These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released as we plug and abandon wells and facilities in China. Consistent with our other plug and abandonment activities, changes in restricted cash are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Restricted cash totaled   $23 million   and   $13 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and is included in "Other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Investments    
    
  Investments consist of debt and equity securities, a majority of which are classified as  available-for-sale  and stated at fair value. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold. We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security. Investments also consist of short-term investments in certificates of deposit, which are classified as  held-to-maturity  and stated at cost. Accordingly, no unrealized gains and losses are recognized. 
    
  New Accounting Requirements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance regarding the simplification of employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the second quarter of 2016 as permitted by the guidance. Adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial statements, except for the simplification in accounting for income taxes using a modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, we recorded a related deferred tax asset for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits of   $37 million  . As we consider it more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we recorded a full valuation allowance of   $37 million  , resulting in no net effect on our consolidated statement of operations. We elected to continue our current policy of estimating forfeitures.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for leases. The guidance requires recognition of most leases on the balance sheet.     The guidance requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding several broad topics related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance applies prospectively to all entities, requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose certain information when substantial doubt exists. We will adopt this guidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2016. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. In April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance, addressed implementation issues and provided technical corrections. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit). The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.

2  .    Accounts Receivable 
    
  Accounts receivable consisted of the following: 

3.      Inventories 
        
  Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations, and oil produced but not sold in our China operations. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the crude oil inventory from our China operations consisted of approximately   190,000   and   335,000   barrels of crude oil, respectively. 

4  .        Derivative Financial Instruments    
        
  Commodity Derivative Instruments 
        
  We utilize derivative strategies that consist of either a single derivative instrument or a combination of instruments to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future domestic oil and natural gas production. While the use of derivative instruments may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.  
    
  In addition to the derivative strategies outlined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we also utilize swaptions from time to time. A swaption is an option to exercise a swap where the buyer (counterparty) of the swaption purchases the right from the seller (Newfield), but not the obligation, to enter into a fixed-price swap with the seller on a predetermined date (expiration date). The swap price is a fixed price determined at the time of the swaption contract. If the swaption is exercised, the contract will become a swap treated consistent with our other fixed-price swaps. 
    
  Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX. The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk adjustments using counterparty rates of default and time to maturity. The calculation of the fair value of options requires the use of an option-pricing model. See Note   5  ,    Fair Value Measurements  .

At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding derivative positions as set forth in the tables below. 
    
  Crude Oil   

  _________________ 
           (1) 
    For the volumes with sold puts, if the market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the market price plus the following: 

the difference between our floors and our sold puts for collars with sold puts; or 
                
    the difference between our swaps and our sold puts for fixed-price swaps with sold puts. 
     We have effectively locked in the spreads noted above (less the deferred call premium) for a portion of the volumes with sold puts through the use of purchased calls. 
           (2) 
    We deferred the premiums related to the purchased calls until contract settlement. At   September 30, 2016  , the deferred premiums totaled   $15 million  .

           (1) 
    During the third quarter of 2016, we sold natural gas swaption contracts that expired unexercised in October 2016.  
       
  Additional Disclosures about Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The amount of gain (loss) recognized in  Commodity derivative income (expense)  in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments follows: 

The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative instruments with that counterparty. At   September 30, 2016  ,   10     of our   16     counterparties accounted for approximately   85%     of our contracted volumes, with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately   12%  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   85%   of our volumes subject to derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility. Our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.  

5  .        Fair Value Measurements    
        
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 
    
           Level 1: 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
              Level 2: 
    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity fixed-price swaps. 
              Level 3: 
    Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as commodity options (i.e., price collars, sold puts, purchased calls or swaptions).  
                
    We use a modified Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for option and swaption derivative contracts that considers various inputs including: (a) forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.

     Table of Contents  
  NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Our valuation model for the Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP) was a Monte Carlo simulation that was based on a probability model and considered various inputs including: (a) the measurement date stock price, (b) time value and (c) historical and implied volatility.  
       
  Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The determination of the fair values of our derivative contracts incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved. We utilize counterparty rate of default values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to, and receivables from, counterparties. 
    
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following table summarizes the valuation of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods.    
 _________________ 
           (1) 
    During the second quarter of 2016, we transferred   $46 million   of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 category, resulting from our Level 3 swaptions being exercised by the counterparties as swaps in June 2016. 
       
  Qualitative Disclosures about Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Derivatives.        The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the strike prices fixed by our derivative contracts, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the contractual life are discounted to calculate the fair value. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts and interest rates. Significant increases (decreases) in the quoted forward prices for commodities generally lead to corresponding decreases (increases) in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts. Significant changes in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts. Historically, we have not experienced significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an  investment grade  credit rating. See Note   4  , "  Derivative Financial Instruments  ," for additional discussion of our derivative instruments. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation.      The calculation of the fair value of the SVAP liability required the use of a probability-based Monte Carlo simulation, which included unobservable inputs. The simulation predicted multiple scenarios of future stock returns over the performance period, which were discounted to calculate the fair value. The fair value was recognized over a service period derived from the simulation. The SVAP performance period and program ended December 31, 2015.

At   September 30, 2016  , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of   $41.73   per barrel for oil and   $2.28   per MMBtu for natural gas. Using these prices, our ceiling for the U.S. exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties and no ceiling test impairment was required at   September 30, 2016  . In the first and second quarters of 2016, we recorded U.S. ceiling test impairments totaling approximately   $962 million   (  $962 million   after tax due to a full valuation allowance on related deferred tax assets). 
    
  Using SEC pricing, our ceiling for China exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties and no ceiling test impairment was required at   September 30, 2016  . In the first and second quarters of 2016, we recorded China ceiling test impairments totaling approximately   $66 million   (  $66 million   after tax due to a full valuation allowance on related deferred tax assets).  
  Future declines in SEC pricing or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could result in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods. 
  Texas Asset Sale 
  On September 23, 2016, we closed on our previously disclosed transactions to divest substantially all of our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately   $380 million  , subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The sales of our Texas assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized. These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Texas operations through the date of sale. 
  Anadarko Basin Acquisition 
  On June 30, 2016, we acquired additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for an adjusted cash purchase price of   $490 million  . The purchase price is subject to customary post-close adjustments and is pending the outcome of pre-acquisition contingencies associated with title matters. We also assumed asset retirement obligations of   $8 million  . We allocated   $412 million   to unproved properties and wells in progress and   $86 million   to proved oil and gas properties. 

7  .      Other Property and Equipment 
    
         Other property and equipment consisted of the following:

8  .        Income Taxes    
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate.  

Due to the ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in 2015, we moved from a deferred tax liability position to a deferred tax asset position in most taxing jurisdictions. With the continuation of current commodity price levels, we consider it more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized and therefore, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our domestic and China deferred tax assets. As long as we are in a net deferred tax asset position, our effective income tax rate will be significantly lower than the statutory rate. For periods with net income, our deferred tax asset position is reduced, which results in a decrease in the valuation allowance. For periods with a net loss, our deferred tax asset is increased, which results in an increase to the valuation allowance. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did not accrue related interest or penalties. The tax years 2011 through 2015 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.

  The change in our asset retirement obligations (ARO) is set forth below (in millions): 

_________________ 
           (1) 
    Additions include   $8 million   of abandonment obligations assumed through our Anadarko Basin acquisition. See Note   6  ,  Oil and Gas Properties.  
              (2) 
    Settlements include   $33 million   related to the sale of our Texas assets. See Note   6  ,  Oil and Gas Properties.  

11  .      Debt 
    
  Our debt consisted of the following: 

________ 
           (1) 
    Because we have the ability and intent to use our available credit facility capacity to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations, if any, are classified as long-term debt. 
       
  Credit Arrangements 
        
   In March 2016, we entered into the fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment changed certain definitions related to our financial covenants and decreased our interest coverage ratio from   3.0  :1.0 to   2.5  :1.0. Our borrowing capacity remains at   $1.8 billion   and the facility maturity date remains June 2020. We incurred approximately   $3 million   of financing costs related to this amendment, which were included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated statement of operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was   12%   of total commitments.  
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, our debt rating was downgraded by rating agencies, and as a result, our borrowing costs under the credit facility increased by 50 basis points. In addition, our available borrowing capacity (before any amounts drawn) under our money market lines of credit with various institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of those financial institutions, was reduced from   $195 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $105 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This borrowing capacity is subject to compliance with restrictive covenants in our credit facility.

Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (125 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  ) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (225 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  ). 
    
  Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating (42.5 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  ). We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately     $2 million   and   $6 million   for the three and   nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which were recorded in  Interest expense  on our consolidated statement of operations. For the three and   nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately   $2 million   and   $4 million  , respectively. 
    
  Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed   0.6   to 1.0 and the maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and ceiling test impairments) to interest expense of at least   2.5   to 1.0. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility. Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating (225     basis points at   September 30, 2016  ).      
    
  The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made; a change of control; or certain other material adverse changes in our business. Our senior notes also contain standard events of default. If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable. In addition, our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations. 
    
  Senior Subordinated Notes 
    
  In April 2015, we redeemed our   $700 million   aggregate principal amount of 6   %   Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020. In connection with the redemption, we paid a premium of   $24 million  . The premium was recorded under the caption "Other income (expense)   Other, net" on our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, associated unamortized offering costs and discounts of approximately   $8 million   were charged to interest expense during the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the redemption.  

12  .    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  In May 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the Company alleging certain plugging and abandonment predecessor-in-interest liabilities related to offshore assets sold by the Company in 2010. The Company responded to the petition, denied the allegations and vigorously defended the case. The court held that the Company must bear a "portion" of the plugging and abandonment costs, but the "exact percentage" of such costs should be determined in arbitration and stayed the case pending arbitration. Through settlement negotiations surrounding the arbitration proceeding, the Company and the plaintiff reached a mutual settlement on September 23, 2016 involving a cash payment by the Company totaling   $18 million  . The settlement was recorded under the caption "Operating expenses   Other" on our consolidated statement of operations. On October 3, 2016, the court dismissed the case with prejudice. 
    
  We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims. Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

Equity Awards 
    
  Equity awards consist of service-based and performance- or market-based restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately (1)   5.1 million     shares available for issuance under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended (2011 Plan), if all future awards are stock options, or (2)     2.7 million     shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan if all future awards are restricted stock awards or restricted stock units.  
    Restricted Stock.      The following table provides information about restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit activity. 

________ 
           (1) 
    In February 2016, we granted approximately   436,000   restricted stock units, which based on achievement of certain performance criteria, could vest within a range of   0%   to   200%   of shares granted upon completion of the performance period ending in December 2018. 
       
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan.      During the first six months of 2016, options to purchase approximately   60,000   shares of our common stock were issued under our ESPP. The fair value of each option was   $9.20   per share. The fair value of the options granted was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends, a risk-free interest rate of   0.47%  , an expected life of   six months   and weighted-average volatility of   47.9%  . 
    
  On July 1, 2016, options to purchase approximately   41,000   shares of our common stock were granted under our ESPP. The fair value of each option was   $12.58   per share as determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends, a risk-free interest rate of   0.35%  , an expected life of   six months   and weighted-average volatility of   48%  . 
    
  Stock Options.      As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   190,000     stock options outstanding and exercisable. No stock options have been granted since 2008, except for ESPP options as discussed above. 
    
  Liability Awards 
    
  Liability awards consist of service-based awards that are settled in cash instead of shares, as discussed below. 
    
    Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units.      The value of the cash-settled restricted stock units, and the associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a liability of   $8 million     for future cash settlement upon vesting of awards. The following table provides information about cash-settled restricted stock unit activity.

16  .  Restructuring Costs 
    
  In May 2016, we announced plans to consolidate and reorganize domestic operating functions to our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas, which resulted in a significant reduction of employees located in the Tulsa, Oklahoma office during the third quarter of 2016. Our decision to restructure the organization was primarily in response to the current oil and gas commodity price environment. Substantially all restructuring-related costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2016. We abandoned our Tulsa, Oklahoma office space during the third quarter of 2016 and recorded a liability for the remaining contracted payments.  
    
  In April 2015, we announced plans to combine our onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain business units. Our decision to restructure the organization, which only affected our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain business units, was primarily in response to the oil and gas commodity price environment. Substantially all restructuring-related costs were incurred by December 31, 2015. We abandoned our Denver, Colorado office space during the third quarter of 2015 and recorded a loss for the remaining contracted payments net of expected sublease income. We closed our North Houston (Greenspoint area) office in the first quarter of 2016.  
    
  Restructuring costs recorded in our consolidated statement of operations are set forth below.

Item 2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and     Results of Operations 

Overview 
        
  We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our operations are focused primarily on large scale, onshore liquids-rich resource plays in the United States. Our principal areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Uinta Basin of Utah. In addition, we have oil developments offshore China. 
    
    Significant   third   quarter   2016   highlights include: 

divested substantially all of our oil and gas assets in the Maverick and Gulf Coast basins of Texas for approximately   $380 million  ; 

substantially completed the consolidation of our Tulsa regional office to our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas; 

All consolidated and domestic BOE calculations above exclude natural gas produced and consumed in operations of   1.4     Bcf for the   third   quarter of 2016 and   1.9   Bcf for the   third   quarter of 2015.  

Results of Operations             
    Domestic Revenues and Production.      Revenues during the   third quarter   of   2016   were $38 million higher than the same period of   2015  . The higher revenues were primarily attributable to a 12% increase in production combined with a 10% increase in average realized NGL prices and slight increases in the average realized prices of natural gas and oil. Our Anadarko Basin oil, gas and NGL production increased by 43%, 35%, and 39%, respectively, due to drilling activity as well as the acquisition of additional acreage. Combined production from our other domestic basins experienced natural declines as compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due to reduced investment levels in those areas. 
    
  Revenues during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were $91 million lower than the same period of   2015  . The lower revenues were attributable to a 20% decrease in average realized prices compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . We increased our domestic liquids production by 11% and gas production by 17% compared to   2015  , reducing the impact of lower commodity prices by $51 million and $36 million, respectively. Our Anadarko Basin oil, gas and NGL production increased by 57%, 42% and 42%, respectively, due to drilling activity as well as the acquisition of additional acreage. Williston Basin production increased by 7% primarily due to the results of our drilling program and reduced flare volumes. Combined production from our other domestic basins experienced natural declines as compared to   2015   due to reduced investment levels in those areas. 
    
  China Revenues and Production/Liftings.      Revenues during the   third quarter   of   2016   were $23 million lower than the same quarter of   2015   primarily due to a 35% decrease in volumes lifted and a   3%   decrease in average realized crude oil prices. The lower lifting volumes resulted from a decrease in the net entitlement from the Pearl field based on the cost recovery provisions of the production sharing contract.  
    
  Revenues during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were $47 million lower than the same period of 2015, primarily due to a   27%   decrease in average realized crude oil prices. China liftings for the first   nine months   of   2016   were   6%   higher than the comparable period of   2015   primarily due to   nine months   of production in 2016 from the Pearl field, which achieved peak production levels in May 2015.  

25 

The following table reflects our production/liftings and average realized commodity prices.

    Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced. 
              (3) 
    Had we included the realized effects of derivative contracts, the average realized prices for our domestic crude oil and natural gas production would have been as follows:

Operating Expenses.  
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 
    
  The following table presents information about our operating expenses. 

Domestic Operations.      The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows: 

Lease operating expense decreased   12%   despite a   12%   increase in total production due to our focus on cost-reduction initiatives in all basins. On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense was   22%   lower due to lower overall costs combined with our focused growth in the Anadarko Basin, which has significantly lower per unit operating costs than our other basins.  

Transportation and processing expense per BOE increased   20%   primarily due to higher natural gas and NGL volumes in our SCOOP and STACK plays. Third quarter 2016 gas production from these two plays increased 35% compared to the third quarter of 2015, while NGL production increased 39%. Additionally, oil transportation costs were higher due to pipeline marketing agreements initiated during the second half of 2015 for the Williston Basin and during the third quarter of 2016 for the STACK play. These pipeline agreements allow us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a higher net price. 

Production and other taxes decreased   12%   per BOE due to our current development activities occurring in areas with lower production tax rates. 
     
   27 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) decreased   49%     on a per BOE basis primarily due to a reduction of our DD A rate as a result of the ceiling test impairments during the fourth quarter of   2015   and the first half of   2016   and the sale of substantially all of our Texas oil and gas assets in the third quarter of 2016.    

General and administrative expenses decreased     2%     during the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . Costs associated with our reduction in workforce and restructuring were   $16 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $18 million   during the same period of 2015.     Cost savings resulting from workforce reductions were offset by higher stock-based compensation costs. 

During the   third quarter   of   2015  , we recorded a ceiling test impairment of   $1.8 billion   due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The decrease primarily resulted from a 17% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 10% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing during the   third quarter   of   2015  . These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of service cost reductions in reserve estimates. No ceiling test impairment was required during the   third quarter   of   2016  . 

Other operating expenses increased $17 million due to the settlement of a lawsuit against the Company during the third quarter of 2016. See Note   12  , "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report. 
       
  China Operations.      The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows: 

Lease operating expense decreased   24%   primarily related to Pearl field cost reductions from renegotiated contracts, combined with lower production handling fees resulting from lower production and crude oil prices. On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense increased   14%   primarily due to a   35%   decrease in lifting volumes. 

DD A expense per BOE decreased   53%   primarily due to the impact of ceiling test impairments during   2015   and the first and second quarters of   2016  .  

During the   third quarter   of   2015  , we recorded a ceiling test impairment of   $72 million   due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The decrease primarily resulted from a 17% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing during the   third quarter   of   2015  . No ceiling test impairment was required during the   third quarter   of   2016  .

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 
    
  The following table presents information about our operating expenses.   

Domestic Operations.      The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:  

Lease operating expense decreased   20%   despite a   13%   increase in total production due to our focus on cost-reduction initiatives in all basins. On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense was   29%   lower due to lower overall costs combined with our focused growth in the Anadarko Basin, which has significantly lower per unit operating costs than our other basins.  

Transportation and processing expense per BOE increased   15%   primarily due to higher natural gas and NGL volumes in our SCOOP and STACK plays. During the first   nine months   of 2016, gas and NGL production from these two plays increased 42% compared to the same period of 2015. Additionally, oil transportation costs were higher due to pipeline marketing agreements initiated during the second half of 2015 for the Williston Basin and during the second and third quarters of 2016 for the STACK play. These pipeline agreements allow us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a higher net price.  

Production and other taxes decreased   31%   per BOE due to our current development activities occurring in areas with lower production tax rates combined with the impact of lower revenues. 

29 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased   47%   on a per BOE basis primarily due to a reduction of our DD A rate as a result of the ceiling test impairments during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first half of 2016 and the sale of substantially all of our Texas oil and gas assets in the third quarter of 2016. 

General and administrative expenses decreased   7%   during the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the first   nine months   of   2015  . Employee-related expenses were approximately $7 million lower due to a reduction of headcount as compared to the   nine months ended September 30,   2015. Non-cash losses related to the abandonment of our Tulsa and Denver office leases were $7 million lower during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of 2015. 

In the first and second quarters of   2016  , we recorded ceiling test impairments totaling   $962 million   due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The decrease primarily resulted from a 14% decrease in both crude oil and natural gas SEC pricing during the six months ended June 30, 2016. These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of service cost reductions in reserve estimates. No ceiling test impairment was required during the third quarter of 2016. During the first   nine months   of   2015  , we recorded a ceiling test impairment of   $4.1 billion   due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from a 38% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 30% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since December 31, 2014. These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of service cost reductions in reserve estimates.  

Other operating expenses increased $12 million primarily due to the settlement of a lawsuit against the Company during the third quarter of 2016. See Note   12  , "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report. 
       
  China Operations.      The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows: 

On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense was   7%   lower primarily due to a   6%   increase in lifting volumes. 

DD A expense per BOE decreased by   25%   primarily due to the impact of the ceiling test impairments during 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016. 

In the first and second quarters of 2016, we recorded ceiling test impairments totaling $  66 million   due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The primary reason for the change in value was a 14% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing during the six months ended June 30, 2016. No ceiling test impairment was required during the third quarter of 2016. During the   nine months   ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a ceiling test impairment of   $72 million   due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.  
       
  Interest Expense  .      The following table presents information about interest expense. Interest expense associated with unproved oil and gas properties is capitalized into oil and gas properties. 

Gross interest expense decreased for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the redemption of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 in April 2015. This decrease was partially offset by the additional interest expense associated with our $700 million 5 % Senior Notes due 2026 issued in March 2015 and   $3 million   of financing costs related to the fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement in 2016. 
    
  Capitalized interest increased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to an increase in the average amount of unproved oil and gas properties, primarily related  
  
   30 

to the acquisition of unproved properties during the second quarter of 2016. See Note   6  , "Oil and Gas Properties," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report.  
    
  Commodity Derivative Income (Expense).      The fluctuations in commodity derivative income (expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding derivative instruments during these periods. The amount of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives is the result of the change in the total fair value of our derivative positions from the prior period.  
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016    
    
  The   $28 million   gain recognized in  Commodity derivative income (expense)  in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments is comprised of a   $39 million   realized gain and a   $11 million   unrealized loss. The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follow: 

Nine months ended   September 30, 2016 
    
  The   $122 million   loss recognized in  Commodity derivative income (expense)  in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments is comprised of a   $185 million   realized gain and a   $307 million   unrealized loss. The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follow: 

31 

Taxes.      Our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the change in valuation allowances, non-deductible expenses, state income taxes, the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates, AMT refunds and the impact of our China earnings being taxed both in the U.S. and China. Our future effective tax rates may also be impacted by additional ceiling test impairments or other items which generate deferred tax assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and/or reversal of such valuation allowances. As long as we are in a net deferred tax asset position, our effective income tax rate will be significantly lower than the statutory rate. For periods with net income, our deferred tax asset position is reduced, which results in a decrease in the valuation allowance. For periods with a net loss, our deferred tax asset is increased, which results in an increase to the valuation allowance. 
    
  The effective tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   8.7%   and   35.2%  , respectively. The following table summarizes our tax activity that derives our effective tax rate for the   third quarter   of   2016  .   

The effective tax rates for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   (0.9)%   and   36.0%  , respectively. The following table summarizes our tax activity that derives our effective tax rate for the first   nine months   of   2016  .   

See Note   8  , "  Income Taxes  ," to our consolidated financial statements earlier in this report for additional disclosures. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, crude oil prices declined significantly primarily due to global supply and demand imbalances. Crude oil prices continued to decline in 2015 and remained depressed in the   third   quarter of 2016, as compared to periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2014. Given the future uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of an eventual recovery of crude oil prices, our planned capital spending for 2016 was reduced from 2015 levels to reduce deficit spending and preserve long-term liquidity.  
    
  During the first   nine months   of 2016, as a part of our strategy to optimize long-term liquidity, we issued   34.5 million   additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately   $776 million  . A portion was used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit. The remainder was used for general corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for an  
  
   32 

adjusted cash purchase price of approximately   $490 million  . During the third quarter of 2016, we divested substantially all of our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately   $380 million  .     A portion of the proceeds from the sale may be used to fund our remaining 2016 capital program. 
    
  Our updated   2016   capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and direct internal costs of approximately $120 million, is expected to be approximately $750 million. Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results; oil, natural gas and NGL prices; industry conditions; the prices and availability of goods and services; and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances or fluctuations in our cash flows.  
    
  We continuously monitor our liquidity needs, coordinate our capital expenditure program with our expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluate our available alternative sources of liquidity, including selling non-strategic assets or potentially accessing debt and equity capital markets in light of current and expected economic conditions. We believe that our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our operations will be adequate to fund 2016 operations and continue to meet our other obligations. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
    
  Credit Arrangements and Other Financing Activities.      In March 2016, we entered into the fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment changed certain definitions related to our financial covenants and decreased our interest coverage ratio from 3.0:1.0 to 2.5:1.0. Our borrowing capacity remains at   $1.8 billion   and the facility maturity date remains June 2020. We incurred approximately   $3 million   of financing costs related to this amendment, which were included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated statement of operations. At   September 30, 2016  , we had available borrowing capacity (before any amounts drawn) under our money market lines of credit of   $105 million  , which was reduced from   $195 million   at   December 31, 2015   due to the downgrading of our debt rating by rating agencies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings outstanding under our money market lines of credit, no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility. 
    
  We have no scheduled maturities of senior notes until 2022. For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior notes, see Note   11  ,  Debt,  to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in this report. 
    
  As of   October 27, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings and available borrowing capacity of   $1.8 billion   under our revolving credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents of $504 million. As of   October 27, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings under our money market lines of credit and available capacity of $105 million. 
    
  Working Capital.      Our working capital balance fluctuates primarily as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners. Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. At   September 30, 2016  , we had positive working capital of $314 million compared to negative working capital of $22 million at   December 31, 2015   due to proceeds from the sale of our Texas assets in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Cash Flows from Operations.      Our primary source of capital and liquidity is cash flows from operations, which are primarily affected by the sale of our oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as commodity prices, net of the effects of derivative contract settlements and changes in working capital.  
    
  Our net cash flows from operations were   $587 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which decreased compared to net cash flows from operations of   $889 million   for the same period in   2015  . The primary drivers of lower operating cash flows were lower revenues as a result of lower commodity prices and lower realized derivative gains. 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities.      Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $  829 million   compared to   $1.3 billion   for the same period in   2015  . Cash used for capital additions in the first   nine months   of 2016 was approximately $600 million lower than the same period in 2015 due to our planned reductions in 2016 capital spending resulting from the current economic environment for our industry. Cash paid for acquisitions of oil and gas properties in the first   nine months   of 2016 was $372 million higher than the same period in 2015 due to our Anadarko Basin STACK acquisition in 2016. Proceeds received from sales of oil and gas properties in the first   nine months   of 2016 were $313 million higher than the  
  
   33 

same period in 2015. This increase is primarily due to the divestiture of substantially all of our oil and gas assets in Texas in 2016. For a more detailed description of the Anadarko Basin acquisition and Texas asset divestiture, see Note   6  ,  Oil and Gas Properties,  to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in this report.  
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities.      Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $715 million   compared to   $389 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued   34.5 million   additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately   $776 million  , a portion of which was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit. The remainder was used for general corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we received net proceeds of   $815 million   through the issuance of   25.3 million   additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering, which were used to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit. In addition, we received proceeds of $691 million through the issuance of senior notes, which we used to redeem $700 million of senior subordinated notes. 
    
  Capital Expenditures.      Our capital investments for the first   nine months   of   2016     decreased 7% compared to the same period of   2015  . The table below summarizes our capital investments. 

Ceiling Test Impairment 
    
  We recorded ceiling test impairments for the first and second quarters of 2016 for both the U.S. and China due to the ceiling not exceeding the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties. At September 30, 2016, the ceiling value for our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of   $41.73   per barrel of oil and   $2.28   per MMBtu for natural gas. Using these prices, no ceiling test impairments were required at September 30, 2016. It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating and development costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes. Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, it is possible that we could experience additional ceiling test impairments in the future. Once recorded, a ceiling test impairment is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase. Future declines in SEC pricing or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could result in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods. 
  Restructuring 
    
  In April 2015 and May 2016, we announced plans to restructure our organization primarily in response to the current commodity price environment and to improve margins, processes and cost efficiencies in operations. See Note   16  , "Restructuring Costs," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations. For further information, see  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . There have been no material changes to the disclosure since year-end   2015  .  
    
  Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements.      Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are  
  
   34 

typically shared on a  working interest  basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. 

Oil and Gas Derivatives 
        
  We use derivative contracts to manage the variability in cash flows caused by commodity price fluctuations associated with our anticipated oil and gas production for the next     24 to 36 months. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had     no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
    
  For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see "  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices  " in Item 3 of this report. See the discussion and tables in Note   4  ,    Derivative Financial Instruments  ,  and Note   5  ,    Fair Value Measurements  ,  to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Between October 1, 2016 and   October 27, 2016  , we entered into additional natural gas derivative contracts. A listing of all our natural gas derivative contracts as of   October 27, 2016   follows:   

Accounting for Derivative Activities.      As our derivative contracts are not designated for hedge accounting, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. We have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had net derivative assets of $60 million, of which 56%, based on total contracted volumes, was measured based upon a modified Black-Scholes valuation model and, as such, were classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The model considers various inputs including the following: 
    
     forward prices for commodities; 
     time value; 
     volatility factors; 
     counterparty credit risk; and 
     current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments. 
    
  As a result, the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than their fair value as of   September 30, 2016  . We use counterparty rate of default values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties. See    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Commodity Derivative Activities    in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Note   4  ,

  Proved reserves.      Those quantities of oil and natural gas, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible   from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations   prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
    
  Resource play.      A play targeting tight sand, coal bed or shale reservoirs. The reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. 
    
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices    
        
  Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to enter into derivative contracts is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While the use of derivative contracts can limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of derivative contracts may involve basis risk. All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market. The use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At   September 30, 2016  ,   10   of our   16   counterparties accounted for approximately   85%   of our contracted volumes with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately   12%  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , of our remaining expected   2016   crude oil production, 6,992 MBbls were protected against price volatility using collars and swaps, over 51% of which have associated sold puts. The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average of our sold puts of   $74.62   per barrel. If the market price remains below   $74.62   per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.32 per barrel. For   3,588   MBbls of our   2016   volumes, we have locked in an average minimum premium of $14.04 over the market price using purchased calls. The weighted average strike price of the purchased calls approximates the weighted average strike price of the sold puts, thereby effectively locking in the value. As of   September 30, 2016  , of our expected 2017 crude oil production, 12,753 MBbls were protected against price volatility using collars and swaps, over 51% of which have associated sold puts. The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average price of our sold puts of   $73.83   per barrel. If the market price remains below   $73.83   per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.06 per barrel. For   6,548   MBbls of our 2017 volumes, we have locked in an average minimum premium of $13.54 over the market price using purchased calls.  
    
  For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see the discussion and tables in Note   4  ,    Derivative Financial Instruments  ,  and Note   5  ,    Fair Value Measurements  ,  to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in this report. For further discussion of the types of derivative positions, refer to Note 4,  Derivative Financial Instruments,  within Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Interest Rates 
    
  We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 100%     of our obligations were at fixed rates as of   September 30, 2016  . A 10% increase in LIBOR would not     impact our interest costs on debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , but would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
        
  The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in a foreign country are not denominated in the U.S. dollar, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts related to foreign currencies at   September 30, 2016  .

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
        
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
        
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the   third quarter   of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based upon our evaluation, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 

Item 1.      Legal Proceedings 
    
  We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims. Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) announced its intent to resolve alleged systemic violations of the North Dakota air pollution control laws, N.D.C.C. ch. 23-25, N.D. Admin. Code art. 33-15, the North Dakota State Implementation Plan, and those provisions of the federal Clean Air Act and its body of implementing regulations for which the NDDH has been delegated authority by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at the Company's facilities in North Dakota. The enforcement and settlement process results from EPA and North Dakota inspections of oil and gas facilities in North Dakota that revealed certain incidents of non-compliance at some facilities of the Company. Companies that voluntarily choose to enter into the Consent Decree do not admit any violations but choose to do so in order to avoid potentially harsher enforcement through subsequent inspections of operated facilities in North Dakota. The Company has entered into a Consent Decree that includes a payment of civil penalties and compliance with the terms and conditions therein. The penalties to be paid are also subject to possible reductions for early compliance with certain conditions therein for at least two years. In addition to the stipulated penalty there will be additional conditions added to facility permits requiring the Company to review and analyze its facility designs, and implement inspection and maintenance programs, among other conditions contained therein. Once signed, the Consent Decree will be filed with the North Dakota District Court in Burleigh County and subsequently reduced to a court order subject to termination upon consent from the Department of Health that all terms of the Consent Decree have been completed to the Department s satisfaction or after two years, or a company may petition the court for termination. We do not anticipate that these penalties will exceed $1 million.  
  In addition, from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate related to alleged violations of environmental statutes or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines or penalties, or if such fines or penalties are imposed, that they would individually or in the aggregate exceed $100,000. If any fines or penalties are in fact imposed that are greater than $100,000, or we expect to be greater than $100,000, then we will disclose such fact in our subsequent filings. For a further discussion of our legal proceedings, see Note   12  , "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in this report.

Item 1A.       Risk Factors

NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY 
  TAX ELECTION REGARDING  
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS 
  VESTING ON [DATE] 
  Employee Name:         ____________________________________________ 
  Social Security Number:        ___________________________________________ 
  Under the terms of the Newfield Exploration Company 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended (the    Plan   ), and the applicable award agreements (the    Award Agreements   ) governing the time-vested restricted stock unit awards set forth below (the    RSUs   ), Newfield Exploration Company (the    Company   ) is authorized to withhold from the shares of the Company s common stock or the cash equivalent thereof payable upon vesting and settlement of such RSUs the amount of any federal and state income and other payroll taxes, as applicable, due or potentially payable in connection therewith at the indicated rates and amounts noted below (the    Applicable Taxes   ).  Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement, I hereby elect the following manner of payment of the Applicable Taxes related to my RSUs that are scheduled to vest on [date]: 
                           Date of Award   (1)  
    Selected Tax Rate   (2)  
    Number of Stock-Settled RSUs Vesting on [date] 
    Number of Cash-Settled RSUs Vesting on [date] 
    Total Number of RSUs required to be withheld 
    %/units withheld from Stock Settled RSUs   (3)  
    %/units withheld from Cash Settled RSUs   (3)  

(1) 
    Indicate the award date of the stock settled and cash settled awards. 
              (2) 
    Tax Rate options are the statutory minimum (25%), statutory maximum (39.6%) and your W-4 withholding rate, plus any other applicable payroll taxes including FICA and Medicare.  For supplemental wages paid to you during calendar year [year] that do not exceed $1 million, you may elect withholding at either the statutory minimum or your W-4 withholding rate.  If supplemental wages paid to you during calendar year [year] exceed $1 million, the excess over $1 million will automatically be subject to withholding at 39.6% notwithstanding any other election, and you may also elect to subject the entire amount of such supplemental wage payment to withholding at the statutory maximum rate.  
        
  Upon vesting and settlement of my RSUs noted in the chart above, I direct the Company to withhold the Applicable Taxes due or potentially payable in connection therewith from 1) the cash amount otherwise payable to me pursuant to the Cash-Settled RSUs vesting on a given vesting date, and/or 2) the number of shares otherwise issuable to me pursuant to the Stock-Settled RSUs vesting on a given vesting date, each in accordance with the instructions noted in the chart above. 
  I understand and agree that if I make this election, the amount of cash paid to me in settlement of such Cash-Settled RSUs and/or the amount of shares issued to me upon vesting of such Stock -Settled RSUs will be reduced, in the aggregate, by the total amount of the Applicable Taxes due or potentially payable, each in accordance with the instructions noted in the chart above. 

I understand and agree to the election I have made above.  Any changes made to this election after the date hereof must be made in writing on a new election signed by the employee and any such new election shall only become effective upon receipt by the Company of the executed form evidencing such new election.
