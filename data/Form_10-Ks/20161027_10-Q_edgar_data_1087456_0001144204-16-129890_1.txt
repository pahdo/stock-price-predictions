NOTE 1   CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The consolidated financial statements of United
Bancshares, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Corporation ) have been prepared without audit and in the opinion of management
reflect all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly such information for the periods
and dates indicated. Since the unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q,
they do not contain all information and footnotes typically included in financial statements prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from
completed audited consolidated financial statements with footnotes, which are included in the Corporation s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Union Bank Company (the  Bank ). The Bank has
formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, UBC Investments, Inc. ( UBC ), to hold and manage its securities portfolio. The operations
of UBC are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The Bank has also formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, UBC Property, Inc., to hold and
manage certain property. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounting
and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to generally accepted practices within the banking industry. The Corporation
considers all of its principal activities to be banking related. 

NOTE 2   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, amending ASU Subtopic 825-10. The amendments in this
update make targeted improvements to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as follows: 1) Require equity investments
to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.; 2) Simplify the impairment assessment of equity
investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.; 3) Eliminate
the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public
business entities.; 4) Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions
used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance
sheet.; 5) Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments
for disclosure purposes.; 6) Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change
in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to
measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.; 7) Require separate presentation
of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying
notes to the financial statements.; and 8) Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred
tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments
in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Corporation has not yet made a determination
of the potential impact on the financial statements of the provisions for ASU 2016-01. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires an organization
to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information
to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although
the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Organizations will continue to
use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. Additionally, the ASU amends the
accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. For
public companies, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Corporation
has not yet determined the potential impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4   LOANS
AND LEASES 

The following tables present the activity in
the allowance for loan and lease losses by portfolio segment for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

The following tables present the balance in
the allowance for loan and lease losses and the recorded investment in loans and leases by portfolio segment and based on impairment
method for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

Impaired loans and leases were as follows
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

No Additional funds are committed to be advanced
in connection with impaired loans and leases. 

The average recorded investment in impaired
loans and leases (excluding loans and leases acquired with deteriorated credit quality) for the nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $4.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. There was approximately $255,000 and $304,000
in interest income recognized by the Corporation on impaired loans and leases on an accrual or cash basis for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Credit Quality Indicators: 

The Corporation categorizes loans and leases into risk categories
based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current final financial information,
historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The
Corporation analyzes loans and leases individually by classifying the loans and leases as to the credit risk. This analysis generally
includes loans and leases with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000 and non-homogenous loans and leases, such as commercial
and commercial real estate loans and leases. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Corporation uses the following
definitions for risk ratings: 

Special Mention:  Loans and leases
which possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness which deserves close attention, but which do not yet warrant substandard
classification. Such loans and leases pose unwarranted financial risk that, if not corrected, could weaken the loan and lease and
increase risk in the future. The key distinctions of a Special Mention classification are that (1) it is indicative of an unwarranted
level of risk, and (2) weaknesses are considered  potential , versus  defined , impairments to the primary
source of loan repayment.    

Substandard:  These loans and leases
are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying ability of the borrower. Loans and leases of this type will
generally display negative financial trends such as poor or negative net worth, earnings or cash flow. These loans and leases may
also have historic and/or severe delinquency problems, and Corporation management may depend on secondary repayment sources to
liquidate these loans and leases. The Corporation could sustain some degree of loss in these loans if the weaknesses remain uncorrected.    

Doubtful:  Loans and leases in this
category display a high degree of loss, although the amount of actual loss at the time of classification is undeterminable. This
should be a temporary category until such time that actual loss can be identified, or improvements made to reduce the seriousness
of the classification.    

Loans and leases not meeting the previous criteria
that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans and leases. Loans and
leases listed as not rated are generally either less than $500,000 or are included in groups of homogenous loans and leases. As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class
of loans and leases is as follows (in thousands): 

The Corporation considers the performance of
the loan and lease portfolio and its impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses. For all loan classes that are not rated,
the Corporation also evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan, which was previously presented, and by payment
activity. Generally, all loans and leases not rated that are 90 days past due or are classified as nonaccrual and collectively
evaluated for impairment, are considered nonperforming. The following table presents the recorded investment in all loans and leases
that are not risk rated, based on payment activity as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

Modifications:  

The Corporation s
loan and lease portfolio also includes certain loans and leases that have been modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR),
where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties.
These concessions typically result from the Corporation s loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the
interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. All TDRs are also classified as impaired
loans and leases.  

When the
Corporation modifies a loan or lease, management evaluates any possible concession based on the present value of expected future
cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan or lease agreement, except with the sole (remaining)
source of repayment for the loan or lease is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, management uses the
current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. If management determines that the value
of the modified loan or lease is less than the recorded investment in the loan or lease (net of previous charge-offs, deferred
loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), an impairment is recognized through a specific reserve in the allowance
or a direct write down of the loan or lease balance if collection is not expected.  

The following table includes the recorded investment
and number of modifications for TDR loans and leases during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

The concessions granted in the above TDR s
were a modification of the original term. The terms were extended on two of the notes. Two notes were re-amortized with a balloon
payment at the end of the terms. The recorded investment in the loans did not change as a result of the modification. There are
not any troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default in the current reporting period. 

The following is additional information with
respect to loans and leases acquired through The Ohio State Bank acquisition (in thousands): 

As a result of The Ohio State Bank acquisition,
the Corporation has loans, for which there was at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and
for which it was probable at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. The carrying amount
of those loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $693,000 and $765,000, respectively. 

No provision for loan and lease losses was
recognized during the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 related to the acquired loans as there was no significant
change to the credit quality of the loans. 

NOTE 5   JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES 

The Corporation has formed and invested $300,000
in a business trust, United (OH) Statutory Trust ( United Trust ) which is not consolidated by the Corporation. United
Trust issued $10,000,000 of trust preferred securities, which are guaranteed by the Corporation, and are subject to mandatory redemption
upon payment of the debentures. United Trust used the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities, as well as
the Corporation s capital investment, to purchase $10,300,000 of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued
by the Corporation. The debentures have a stated maturity date of March 26, 2033. As of March 26, 2008, and quarterly thereafter,
the debentures may be shortened at the Corporation s option. Interest is payable quarterly at a floating rate adjustable
quarterly and equal to 315 basis points over the 3-month LIBOR amounting to 3.56% at September 30, 2016 and 3.48% at September
30, 2015. The Corporation has the right, subject to events in default, to defer payments of interest on the debentures by extending
the interest payment period for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods. 

The Corporation assumed $3,093,000 of trust
preferred securities through The Ohio State Bank acquisition with $3,000,000 of the liability guaranteed by the Corporation and
the remaining $93,000 secured by an investment in the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities carrying value
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $2,498,000 and $2,473,000 respectively. The difference between the principal
owed and the carrying value is due to the below-market interest rate on the debentures. The debentures have a stated maturity date
of April 23, 2034. Interest is at a floating rate adjustable quarterly and equal to 285 basis points over the 3-month LIBOR amounting
to 4.01% at September 30, 2016 and 3.18% at September 30, 2015. 

Each issue of the trust preferred securities
carries an interest rate identical to that of the related debenture. The securities have been structured to qualify as Tier I capital
for regulatory purposes and the dividends paid on such are tax deductible. However, under Federal Reserve Board guidelines, the
securities cannot be used to constitute more than 25% of the Corporation s core Tier I capital inclusive of these securities. 

Interest expense on the debentures amounted
to $365,000 and $325,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in interest
expense-other borrowings in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 

NOTE 6   FAIR VALUE
MEASUREMENTS  

ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market
for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The
price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall not be adjusted
for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement
date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it
is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable,
and both able and willing to transact. 

ASC 820-10 requires the use of valuation techniques
that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach, and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and
other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income
approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount on a discounted
basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement
cost). Valuation techniques should be consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent
sources. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. In that regard, ASC
820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

Level 1    Unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2    Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3    Unobservable inputs
for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect
the Corporation s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Corporation s own financial
data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair
value determination requires significant management judgment. 

Financial assets (there were no financial liabilities)
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include available-for-sale securities,
which are valued using Level 2 inputs except for one other security which is valued using Level 3 inputs, as well as mortgage servicing
rights, amounting to $983,000 at September 30, 2016 and $1,181,000 December 31, 2015, which are valued using Level 3 inputs. Financial
assets (there were no financial liabilities) measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 include impaired loans net of specific reserves approximating $2.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $4.6 million at December
31, 2015, all of which are valued using Level 3 inputs. 

There were no financial instruments measured
at fair value that moved to a lower level in the fair value hierarchy during the period ended September 30, 2016, due to the lack
of observable quotes in inactive markets for those instruments at September 30, 2016. 

The table below presents a reconciliation and
income statement classification of gains and losses for mortgage servicing rights, which are measured at fair value on a recurring
basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December
31, 2015: 

A description of the valuation methodologies
used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
hierarchy, and disclosure of unobservable inputs follows. 

In general, fair value is based upon quoted
market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models
that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments
are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Corporation s
creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently
over time. The Corporation s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net
realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Corporation s valuation methodologies
are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the
fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 

Securities Available-for-Sale   

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities
are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities would typically include government bonds and
exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted
prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which would generally
be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include U. S. Government and agencies, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed
securities, and asset-backed securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to
the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. There were no gains or losses relating
to securities available-for-sale included in earnings before income taxes that were attributable to changes in fair values of securities
held at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Impaired Loans   

The Corporation does not record impaired loans
at fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, a loan is considered impaired and is reported at the fair value of the
underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell, if repayment is expected solely from collateral. Collateral values are estimated
using Level 2 inputs, including recent appraisals and Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria such as additional
appraisal adjustments to consider deterioration of value subsequent to appraisal date and estimated cost to sell. Additional appraisal
adjustments range between 15% and 35% of appraised value, and estimated selling cost ranges between 10% and 20% of the adjusted
appraised value.  Due to the significance of the Level 3 inputs, impaired loans fair values have been classified as Level
3. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights   

The Corporation records mortgage servicing
rights at estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow model which includes discount rates between 9% and 11%, in addition
to prepayment, internal rate of return, servicing costs, inflation rate of servicing costs and earnings rate assumptions that are
considered to be unobservable inputs. Due to the significance of the Level 3 inputs, mortgage servicing rights have been classified
as Level 3. 

Other Real Estate Owned   

The Corporation values other real estate owned
at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less appraisal adjustments between 10% and 70% of appraised value, and
expected selling costs between 10% and 20% of adjusted appraised value. Such values are estimated primarily using appraisals and
reflect a market value approach. Due to the significance of the Level 3 inputs, other real estate owned has been classified as
Level 3. 

Certain other financial assets and financial
liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing
basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. Financial
assets and financial liabilities, excluding impaired loans and other real estate owned, measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis were not significant at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of recognized financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands): 

The above summary does not include accrued
interest receivable or cash surrender value of life insurance which are also considered financial instruments. The estimated fair
value of such items is considered to be their carrying amounts and would be considered Level 1 inputs. 

There are also unrecognized financial instruments
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 which relate to commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. The contract amount
of such financial instruments amounted to $89,019,000 at September 30, 2016 and $84,394,000 at December 31, 2015. Such amounts
are also considered to be the estimated fair values. 

The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments shown above: 

Cash and cash equivalents: 

Fair value is determined to be the carrying
amount for these items (which include cash on hand, due from banks, and federal funds sold) because they represent cash or mature
in 90 days or less, and do not represent unanticipated credit concerns. 

Securities: 

The fair value of securities is determined
based on quoted market prices of the individual securities; if not available, estimated fair value is obtained by comparison to
other known securities with similar risk and maturity characteristics. Such value does not consider possible tax ramifications
or estimated transaction costs. 

Loans and leases: 

Fair value for loans and leases was estimated
for portfolios of loans and leases with similar financial characteristics. For adjustable rate loans, which re-price at least annually
and generally possess low risk characteristics, the carrying amount is believed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. For
fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis, considering weighted average rates and
terms of the portfolio, adjusted for credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loans. Fair value for nonperforming loans is
based on recent appraisals or estimated discounted cash flows. 

Mortgage servicing rights: 

The fair value for mortgage servicing rights
is determined based on an analysis of the portfolio by an independent third party. 

Deposit liabilities: 

The fair value of core deposits, including
demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits, is the amount payable on demand. The fair value of fixed-maturity
certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates offered at quarter end for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The estimated
fair value does not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to
the cost of borrowing funds in the marketplace. 

Other borrowings and junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures: 

The fair value of other borrowings (consisting
of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and customer repurchase agreements), and
junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures are determined using the net present value of discounted cash flows based on
current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, and are obtained from an independent third party. 

Other financial instruments: 

The fair value of commitments to extend credit
and letters of credit is determined to be the contract amount, since these financial instruments generally represent commitments
at existing rates. The fair value of other borrowings is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using current interest
rates. The fair value of other liabilities is generally considered to be carrying value except for the deferred compensation agreement.
The fair value of the contract is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a current interest rate for a similar
instrument. 

The fair value estimates of financial instruments
are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument over the value of
anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Since no ready
market exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are largely based on judgments after
considering such factors as future expected credit losses, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment
and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. 

NOTE 8   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Management evaluated subsequent events through
the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. Events or transactions occurring after September 30, 2016 but prior
to when the consolidated financial statements were issued, that provided additional evidence about conditions that existed at September
30, 2016 have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016. Events or transactions
that provided evidence about conditions that did not exist at September 30, 2016 but arose before the financial statements were
issued have not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

On
October 18, 2016, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.11 per common share payable December 15,
2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2016.

The following discussion and analysis of the
consolidated financial statements of the Corporation is presented to provide insight into management s assessment of the
financial results. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Overview of the Income Statement 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the
Corporation reported net income of $1,378,000, or $0.42 basic earnings per share. This compares to the third quarter of 2015 net
income of $1,503,000, or $0.45 basic earnings per share. The decrease in operating results for the third quarter of 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income of $298,000 and an increase in non-interest
expenses of $140,000 offset by an increase in non-interest income of $246,000 and a decrease in income taxes of $67,000. The decrease
in net interest income was largely attributable to roughly $186,000 less loan discount accretion relating to the November 2014
Ohio State Bank (OSB) acquisition. 

Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 totaled $4,021,000, or $1.22 basic earnings per share compared to $4,528,000, or $1.35 basic earnings per share for the
same period in 2015. Compared with the same period in 2015, net income decreased $507,000, or 11.2%. The decrease in operating
results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 was primarily
attributable to a decrease in net interest income of $1,121,000 and an increase in income taxes of $220,000 offset by an increase
in non-interest income of $148,000, an increase in non-interest expenses of $114,000. The decrease was also attributable to a credit
for loan and lease losses of $700,000 in 2016 compared to a $100,000 provision for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net
interest income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was largely attributable to roughly $686,000 less loan discount
accretion relating to the OSB acquisition. The increase in income taxes, despite a $287,000 decrease in income before income taxes,
was due to a one-time tax benefit of $331,000 recognized during the second quarter of 2015 relating to the OSB acquisition. 

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income is the amount by which
income from interest-earning assets exceeds interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets consist
principally of loans and investment securities while interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposit accounts and
borrowed funds. Net interest income remains the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Changes in market interest rates,
as well as changes in the mix and volume of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income.
Net interest income was $4,961,000 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $5,259,000 for the same period of 2015, a decrease
of $298,000 (5.7%). 

The decrease in net interest income was largely
attributable to a decrease in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,047,000, as compared to the same
period in 2015, including a $711,000 decrease in interest income from loans and leases. The decrease in interest income from loans
and leases was primarily attributable to less loan discount accretion being recognized from the November 2014 OSB acquisition.
For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, $312,000 of loan discount accretion has been recognized compared to $998,000
for the same period in 2015. 

Net interest margin is calculated by dividing
net interest income (adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on a taxable equivalent basis) by average interest-earning
assets. The resulting percentage serves as a measurement for the Corporation in comparing its results with those of past periods
as well as those of peer institutions. For the quarterly and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the net interest margin
(on a taxable equivalent basis) was 3.57% and 3.53%, respectively, compared with 3.75% and 3.66% for the same periods in 2015. 

Interest-bearing deposits comprised 95.9% of
average interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 97.3% for the same period in 2015. 

Provision (Credit) for Loan and Lease
Losses 

The Corporation s provision (credit)
for loan and lease losses is determined based upon management s calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses and
is reflective of management s assessment of the quality of the portfolio and overall management of the inherent credit risk
of the loan and lease portfolio. Changes in the provision (credit) for loan and lease losses are dependent, among other things,
on loan and lease delinquencies, collateral position, portfolio risks and general economic conditions in the Corporation s
lending markets. A $700,000 credit for loan and lease losses was recognized during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.
See  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  under Financial Condition for further discussion relating to the provision
for loan and lease losses. 

Non-Interest Income 

The Corporation s non-interest income
is largely generated from activities related to the origination, servicing and gain on sales of fixed rate mortgage loans; customer
deposit account fees; earnings on life insurance policies; income arising from sales of investment products to customers; and occasional
security sale transactions. Income related to customer deposit accounts and life insurance policies provides a relatively steady
flow of income while the other sources are more volume or transaction related and consequently can vary from quarter to quarter.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income was $1,289,000 compared to $1,043,000 for the third quarter of 2015,
a $246,000 (23.6%) increase. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income was $3,471,000 compared to
$3,323,000 for the same period of 2015, a $148,000 (4.4%) increase. 

Gain on sales of loans amounted to $202,000
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $144,000 for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $58,000 (40.2%). Gain
on sales of loans amounted to $409,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $368,000 for the same period in
2015, an increase of $41,000 (11.1%). 

Gain on sales of securities amounted to $23,000
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $64,000 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $41,000 (64.1%). Gain on
sales of securities amounted to $159,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $116,000 for the same period
in 2015, an increase of $43,000 (37.1%). 

Other operating income increased $229,000 (27.4%)
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and $64,000 (2.3%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in other
operating income was mainly attributable to increases in net DDA service charges and NSF and overdraft charges as well as the impact
of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights described below. 

The fair value of mortgage servicing rights
decreased $198,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an increase in fair value of mortgage servicing rights
of $88,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in fair value of mortgage servicing rights was largely due
to an increase in prepayment speeds, an important element in determining mortgage servicing rights fair value. The increase in
prepayment speeds reflects the market s reaction to interest rates, which decreased during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016. 

Non-Interest Expenses  

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, non-interest
expenses were $4,454,000, compared to $4,314,000 for the third quarter of 2015, a $140,000 (3.3%) increase. For the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expenses totaled $13,371,000, compared to $13,257,000 for the same period of 2015,
an increase of $114,000 (0.9%). The increase in non-interest expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily
attributed to increases in premises and equipment expense, investment management fees, stationary and printing, legal fees, ATM
processing fees, and IT expense offset by decreases in salaries and benefits expense, data processing expense and Ohio financial
institutions tax. 

Maintaining acceptable levels of non-interest
expenses and operating efficiency are key performance indicators for the Corporation in its strategic initiatives. The financial
services industry uses the efficiency ratio (total non-interest expense as a percentage of the aggregate of fully-tax equivalent
net interest income and non-interest income) as a key indicator of performance. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation s
efficiency ratio was 70.25%, compared 67.34% for the same period of 2015. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the
Corporation s efficiency ratio was 72.88% compared to 68.60% for the same period of 2015. 

Provision for Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 was $418,000 (effective rate of 23.3%) compared to $485,000 (effective rate of 24.4%) for the comparable
2015 period. The provision for income taxes for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $1,216,000, or 23.2% of income
before income taxes, compared to $996,000 or 18.0% for the comparable 2015 period. The income tax provision for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015, were favorably impacted as a result of the Corporation recognizing a one-time tax benefit of $331,000
during the second quarter of 2015, resulting from a January 2015 tax law change involving OSB s tax bad debt reserve. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Overview of Balance Sheet 

Total assets amounted to $615.3 million at
September 30, 2016, compared to $608.7 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $6.6 million (1.1%). The increase in total
assets was primarily the result of increases of $9.2 million (5.0%) in available-for-sale securities and $5.3 million (1.5%) in
net loans and leases, offset by a decrease in cash of $6.7 million (29.1%) and a decrease of $1.3 million (24.8%) in other assets.
Deposits during this same period decreased $921,000 or 0.2%. 

Shareholders  equity increased from $71.6
million at December 31, 2015 to $75.3 million at September 30, 2016. This increase was the result of net income of $4,021,000,
dividends paid of $1,086,000, $633,000 from the repurchase of 33,668 shares, $18,000 from the issuance of 843 treasury shares under
the Corporation s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and a $1,463,000 increase in unrealized securities gains, net of tax. The
increase in unrealized securities gains during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, was the result of customary and
expected changes in the bond market. Net unrealized gains on securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income
in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $16.3 million
at September 30, 2016 and $22.9 million at December 31, 2015, including interest-bearing deposits in other banks of $6.5 million
at September 30, 2016 and $11.4 million at December 31, 2015. Management believes the current level of cash and cash equivalents
is sufficient to meet the Corporation s present liquidity and performance needs. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate
on a daily basis due to transactions in process and corresponding liquidity sources and uses. Management believes the Corporation s
liquidity needs in the near term will be satisfied by the current level of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access
to traditional and non-traditional funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that will mature within
one year. These sources of funds should enable the Corporation to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they
come due. In addition, the Corporation has access to various sources of additional borrowings by virtue of long-term assets that
can be used as collateral for such borrowings. 

Securities 

Management monitors the earnings performance
and liquidity of the securities portfolio on a regular basis through Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings. As a result, all
securities, except FHLB stock, have been designated as available-for-sale and may be sold if needed for liquidity, asset-liability
management or other reasons. Such securities are reported at fair value, with any net unrealized gains or losses reported as a
separate component of shareholders  equity, net of related incomes taxes. 

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale
securities as of September 30, 2016 totaled $187.7 million and $192.1 million, respectively, resulting in a net unrealized gain
before tax of $4.4 million and a corresponding after-tax increase in shareholders  equity of $2.9 million. The amortized
cost of available-for-sale securities increased $6.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Loans and Leases 

The Corporation s lending is primarily
centered in Northwestern and West Central Ohio. Gross loans and leases totaled $359.1 million at September 30, 2016, compared to
$354.3 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.8 million (1.4%). 

There are also unrecognized financial instruments
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 which relate to commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. The contract amount
of such financial instruments approximated $89.0 million at September 30, 2016 and $84.4 million at December 31, 2015. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  

The following table presents a summary of activity
in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The allowance for loan and lease losses as
a percentage of gross loans and leases was .94% at September 30, 2016 and 1.00% at December 31, 2015. Regular provisions are made
in amounts sufficient to maintain the balance in the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered by management to
be adequate for losses within the portfolio. Even though management uses all available information to assess possible loan and
lease losses, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be required as changes occur in economic conditions and specific
borrower circumstances. The Bank recognized a negative provision, or credit, for loan and lease losses aggregating $700,000 during
the first two quarters of 2016.  The credit for loan and lease losses was attributable to various factors, including the payoff
in January 2016 of an impaired credit for which the Bank had provided a large specific reserve at December 31, 2015, and a significant
decrease in 2016 year to date net loan charge-offs which has positively impacted (lowered) the Bank s historical loss experience
used in the allowance for loan and lease losses calculation for pooled reserves. The regulatory agencies that periodically review
the Corporation s allowance for loan and lease losses may also require additions to the allowance or the charge-off of specific
loans and leases based upon the information available to them at the time of their examinations. 

Loans and leases on non-accrual status amounted
to $6.2 million and $5.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Non-accrual loans and leases as a percentage
of outstanding loans amounted to 1.7% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Corporation considers a loan or lease to
be impaired when it becomes probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect under the contractual terms of the loan or
lease, as the case may be, based on current information and events. Impaired loans and leases, all consisting of commercial and
commercial real estate credits, amounted to $3.4 million at September 30, 2016 and $6.0 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease
in impaired loans and leases resulted from the payoff of one loan during the first quarter of 2016. All impaired loans and leases
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 had specific reserves, with such reserves amounting to $1.2 million and $1.4 million
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and included in the Corporation s allowance for loan and lease
losses. 

In addition to impaired loans, the Corporation
had other potential problem credits of $9.7 million at September 30, 2016 and $15.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Corporation s
credit administration department continues to closely monitor these credits. 

The Corporation provides pooled reserves for
potential problem loans and leases using loss rates calculated considering historic net loan-charge off experience. The Corporation
has experienced $129,000 of loan charge-offs during the first nine months of 2016 compared to annual loan charge-offs of $638,000
in 2015, $497,000 in 2014, and $2.6 million in 2013, with most of the charge-offs coming from the commercial and commercial real
estate loan portfolios. The Corporation also provides general reserves for the remaining portion of its loan portfolio not considered
to be problem or potential problem loans. These general reserves are also calculated considering, among other things, the historic
net charge-off experience for the relative loan type. 

Funding Sources  

The Corporation considers a number of alternatives,
including but not limited to, deposits, as well as short-term and long-term borrowings when evaluating funding sources. Deposits,
including customer deposits, brokered certificates of deposit, and public funds deposits, continue to be the most significant source
of funds for the Corporation, totaling $517.5 million, or 96.5% of the Corporation s funding sources at September 30, 2016.
Total deposits decreased $921,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Non-interest bearing deposits remain a smaller
portion of the funding source for the Corporation than for most of its peers. Non-interest bearing deposits comprised 17.3% of
total deposits at September 30, 2016, compared to 18.0% at December 31, 2015. 

In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation
maintains both short-term and long-term borrowing arrangements. Other borrowings consisted of FHLB borrowings totaling $5.7 million
at September 30, 2016 and $2.1 million at December 31, 2015. The Corporation also has outstanding junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures of $12.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Management plans to maintain access to various
borrowing alternatives as an appropriate funding source. 

Shareholders  Equity 

Shareholders  equity increased from $71.6
million at December 31, 2015 to $75.3 million at September 30, 2016, principally due to net income of $4,021,000 and a $1,463,000
increase in unrealized securities gains, net of tax, net of dividends paid and net treasury stock transactions. 

For the nine month period ended September 30,
2015, shareholders  equity increased from $67.8 million at December 31, 2014 to $71.4 million. This increase was the result
of net income of $4,528,000, dividends paid of $902,000, repurchase of 39,321 shares of $594,000, the issuance of 715 treasury
shares under the Corporation s Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $14,000, and a $627,000 increase in unrealized securities
losses, net of tax. 

The increase in unrealized securities gains
during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was the result of customary and expected changes in the bond market.
Net unrealized gains/losses on securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Corporation and Bank met all regulatory
capital requirements as of September 30, 2016, and the Bank is considered  well capitalized  under regulatory and industry
standards of risk-based capital. 

Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity  

The objective of the Corporation s asset/liability
management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income through management of the Corporation s balance
sheet liquidity and interest rate exposure based on changes in economic conditions, interest rate levels, and customer preferences. 

The Corporation manages interest rate risk
to minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates on earnings. The Corporation uses simulation techniques that attempt to measure
the volatility of changes in the level of interest rates, basic banking interest rate spreads, the shape of the yield curve, and
the impact of changing product growth patterns. The primary method of measuring the sensitivity of earnings of changing market
interest rates is to simulate expected cash flows using varying assumed interest rates while also adjusting the timing and magnitude
of non-contractual deposit re-pricing to more accurately reflect anticipated pricing behavior. These simulations include adjustments
for the lag in prime loan re-pricing and the spread and volume elasticity of interest-bearing deposit accounts, regular savings
and money market deposit accounts. 

The principal function of interest rate risk
management is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market
interest rates. The Corporation closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis and projects
the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin. Interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as
those assets or liabilities that mature or re-price within a designated time frame. 

Management believes the Corporation s current mix of assets
and liabilities provides a reasonable level of risk related to significant fluctuations in net interest income and the resulting
volatility of the Corporation s earning base. The Corporation s management reviews interest rate risk in relation to
its effect on net interest income, net interest margin, and the volatility of the earnings base of the Corporation. 

Effects of Inflation on Financial Statements 

All of the Corporation s assets relate
to commercial banking operations and are generally monetary in nature. Therefore, they are not impacted by inflation to the same
degree as companies in capital-intensive industries in a replacement cost environment. During a period of rising prices, a net
monetary asset position results in loss of purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase
in purchasing power. In the commercial banking industry, monetary assets typically exceed monetary liabilities. The Corporation
has not experienced a significant level of inflation or deflation during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. However,
because of the depressed national real estate market and sluggish local economy, the Corporation has experienced declines in the
value of collateral securing commercial and non-commercial real estate loans. Management continues to closely monitor these trends
in calculating the Corporation s allowance for loan and lease losses. 

ITEM 3  

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The only significant market risk to which the
Corporation is exposed is interest rate risk. The business of the Corporation and the composition of its balance sheet consist
of investments in interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities), which are funded by interest bearing liabilities (deposits
and borrowings). These financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in the market rates of interest, resulting
in market risk. None of the Corporation s financial instruments are held for trading purposes. 

The Corporation manages interest rate risk
regularly through its Asset Liability Committee. The Committee meets on a regular basis and reviews various asset and liability
management information, including but not limited to, the bank s liquidity positions, projected sources and uses of funds,
interest rate risk positions and economic conditions. 

The Corporation monitors its interest rate
risk through a sensitivity analysis, whereby it measures potential changes in its future earnings and the fair values of its financial
instruments that may result from one or more hypothetical changes in interest rates. This analysis is performed by estimating the
expected cash flows of the Corporation s financial instruments using interest rates in effect at year-end. For the fair value
estimates, the cash flows are then discounted to year-end to arrive at an estimated present value of the Corporation s financial
instruments. Hypothetical changes in interest rates are then applied to the financial instruments, and the cash flows and fair
values are again estimated using these hypothetical rates. For the net interest income estimates, the hypothetical rates are applied
to the financial instruments based on the assumed cash flows. The Corporation typically applies interest rate  shocks 
to its financial instruments up and down under various scenarios up to as much as 400 basis points depending on the overall level
of interest rates at any point in time. 

There have been no material changes in the
quantitative and qualitative information about market risk from the information provided in the Corporation s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 4  

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Controls and Procedures.  

With the participation of our management, including

Exhibit 99 

SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES
LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 (the  Act ) provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide
prospective information about their companies, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied
by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed in the statement. United Bancshares, Inc. ( Corporation ) desires to take advantage of the  safe harbor 
provisions of the Act. Certain information, particularly information regarding future economic performance and finances and plans
and objectives of management, contained or incorporated by reference in the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, is forward-looking. In some cases, information regarding certain important factors that could
cause actual results of operations or outcomes of other events to differ materially from any such forward-looking statement appears
together with such statement. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to other risks and uncertainties affecting the
financial institutions industry, including, but not limited to, the following: 

Interest Rate Risk  

The Corporation s operating results are
dependent to a significant degree on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans, investments
and other interest-earning assets and interest expense on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. The interest
income and interest expense of the Corporation changes as the interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
change. Interest rates may change because of general economic conditions, the policies of various regulatory authorities and other
factors beyond the Corporation's control. In a rising interest rate environment, loans tend to prepay slowly and new loans at higher
rates increase slowly, while interest paid on deposits increases rapidly because the terms to maturity of deposits tend to be shorter
than the terms to maturity or prepayment of loans. Such differences in the adjustment of interest rates on assets and liabilities
may negatively affect the Corporation's income. 

Possible Inadequacy of the Allowance for
Loan and Lease Losses  

The Corporation maintains an allowance for
loan and lease losses based upon a number of relevant factors, including, but not limited to, trends in the level of non-performing
assets and classified loans and leases, current economic conditions in the primary lending area, past loss experience, possible
losses arising from specific problem loans and leases and changes in the composition of the loan and lease portfolio. While the
Board of Directors of the Corporation believe that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan and
lease losses, unforeseen market conditions could result in material adjustments, and net earnings could be significantly adversely
affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination. 

Loans and leases not secured by one to four
family residential real estate are generally considered to involve greater risk of loss than loans secured by one to four family
residential real estate due, in part, to the effects of general economic conditions. The repayment of multifamily residential,
nonresidential real estate and commercial loans generally depends upon the cash flow from the operation of the property or business,
which may be negatively affected by national and local economic conditions. Construction loans may also be negatively affected
by such economic conditions, particularly loans made to developers who do not have a buyer for a property before the loan is made.
The risk of default on consumer loans increases during periods of recession, high unemployment and other adverse economic conditions.
When consumers have trouble paying their bills, they are more likely to pay mortgage loans than consumer loans. In addition, the
collateral securing such loans and leases, if any, may decrease in value more rapidly than the outstanding balance of the loan
or lease. 

Competition  

The Corporation competes for deposits with
other savings associations, commercial banks and credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as shares
in money market mutual funds. The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates and convenience of office location.
In making loans, the Corporation competes with other commercial banks, savings associations, consumer finance companies, credit
unions, leasing companies, mortgage companies and other lenders. Competition is affected by, among other things, the general availability
of lendable funds, general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and other factors that are not readily
predictable. The size of financial institutions competing with the Corporation is likely to increase as a result of changes in
statutes and regulations eliminating various restrictions on interstate and inter-industry branching and acquisitions. Such increased
competition may have an adverse effect upon the Corporation. 

Legislation and Regulation that may Adversely
Affect the Corporation's Earnings  

The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation
by the State of Ohio, Division of Financial Institutions (the  ODFI ), the Federal Reserve Bank (the  FED ),
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ) and is periodically examined by such regulatory agencies to
test compliance with various regulatory requirements. Such supervision and regulation of the Corporation and the bank are intended
primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the maximization of shareholder value and may affect the ability of the
Corporation to engage in various business activities. The assessments, filing fees and other costs associated with reports, examinations
and other regulatory matters are significant and may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's net earnings.
