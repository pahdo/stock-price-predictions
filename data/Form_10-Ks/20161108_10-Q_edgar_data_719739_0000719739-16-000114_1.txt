SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
   
           1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     SVB Financial Group is a diversified financial services company, as well as a bank holding company and financial holding company. SVB Financial was incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 1999. Through our various subsidiaries and divisions, we offer a variety of banking and financial products and services to support our clients of all sizes and stages throughout their life cycles. In these notes to our consolidated financial statements, when we refer to  SVB Financial Group,   SVBFG , the  Company,   we,   our,   us  or use similar words, we mean SVB Financial Group and all of its subsidiaries collectively, including Silicon Valley Bank (the  Bank ), unless the context requires otherwise. When we refer to  SVB Financial  or the  Parent  we are referring only to the parent company, SVB Financial Group, unless the context requires otherwise. 
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP. Such unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future periods. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Form 10-K ). 
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  under Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  The preparation of unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates may change as new information is obtained. Significant items that are subject to such estimates include measurements of fair value, the valuation of non-marketable securities, the valuation of equity warrant assets, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded credit commitments, and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Presentation 
  Prior to April 1, 2015, the Company s consolidated financial statements included the accounts of SVB Financial Group and entities in which we had a controlling interest.  The determination of whether we had controlling interest was based on consolidation principles prescribed by ASC Topic 810 and whether the controlling interest in an entity was a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity ( VIE ). However, during the three months ended June 30, 2015, we early adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (ASU 2015-02), which simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of consolidation models and changing various aspects of current GAAP, including certain consolidation criteria for variable interest entities. The new guidance eliminates the presumption that a general partner of a limited partnership arrangement should consolidate a limited partnership. The amendments to ASC Topic 810 in ASU 2015-02 modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar entities are VIEs or voting entities. With these changes, we determined that the majority of our investments in limited partnership arrangements are VIEs under the new guidance while these entities were typically voting interest entities under the prior guidance. 
  ASU 2015-02 provided a single model for evaluating VIE entities for consolidation. VIEs are entities where investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or equity investors, as a group, lack one of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected returns of the entity. We assess VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  A primary beneficiary is defined as a variable interest holder that has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest requires both: (a) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and (b) obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of a VIE that could potentially be significant to a VIE. Under this analysis, we evaluate kick-out rights and other participating rights which could provide us a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. 
  ASU 2015-02 also changed how we evaluate fees paid to managers of our limited partnership investments. Under the new guidance, we exclude those fee arrangements that are not deemed to be variable interests from the analysis of our interests in our investments in VIEs and the determination of a primary beneficiary, if any.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SVB Financial Group and consolidated entities. We consolidate voting entities in which we have control through voting interests. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in a VIE by determining if we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and whether we have significant variable interests. Generally, we have significant variable interests if our commitments to a limited partnership investment represent a significant amount of the total commitments to the entity. We also evaluate the impact of related parties on our determination of variable interests in our consolidation conclusions. We consolidate VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary based on a controlling financial interest. If we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we record our pro-rata interests or our cost basis in the VIE, as appropriate, based on other accounting guidance within GAAP. 
  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated. We have not provided financial or other support during the periods presented to any VIE that we were not previously contractually required to provide.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)), which provides revenue recognition guidance that is intended to create greater consistency with respect to how and when revenue from contracts with customers is shown in the income statement. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018, either on a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825)), which will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments, and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities. This guidance will be effective on January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)), which will require for all operating leases the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, in the statement of financial position. The lease cost will be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis.  This guidance will be effective on January 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)), which eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method due to an increase in level of ownership or influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2017, on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)), which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance by clarifying the following: how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation; how the control principle applies to transactions, such as service arrangements; reframes the indicators to focus on a principal rather than an agent, removes the credit risk and commission indicators and clarifies the relationship between the control principle and the indicators; and revises the existing illustrative examples and adds new illustrative examples. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018, either on a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)), which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  Under the ASU, an entity recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance also permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. We plan to adopt the share-based payment guidance in the first quarter of 2017. Currently, we record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to APIC at the  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

time of vesting and or settlement, however, upon adoption of this standard, the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recorded to the income statement as income tax expense or benefit. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our annual earnings; however, the impact will vary period to period depending on the volatility of the Company's stock price and the actual timing of settlement of awards. We would expect the most significant impact to occur during our second quarter as the majority of awards vest during that period. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing), which amends the new revenue recognition guidance on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. The amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or a point in time. The amendments also clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable, that is distinct within the context of the contract, and allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of a contract. The effective date and transition requirements for this update are the same as those of the new standard. This guidance is effective January 1, 2018, on either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments), which amends the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2020.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders  equity. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments), which clarifies the guidance on eight specific cash flow issues.  This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our statement of cash flows.

  The following table summarizes the items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive  income into the Consolidated Statements of Income (unaudited) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

EPS 
  Basic EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options and restricted stock units outstanding under our equity incentive plans and our ESPP. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. The following is a reconciliation of basic EPS to diluted EPS for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    Variable Interest Entities 
     Our involvement with VIEs includes our investments in venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and our investments in qualified affordable housing projects.    
  The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

     Table of Contents  

Non-marketable and other securities 
  Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. A majority of these investments are through third party funds held by SVB Financial in which we do not have controlling or significant variable interests. These investments represent our unconsolidated VIEs in the table above. Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio also includes investments from SVB Capital. SVB Capital is the venture capital investment arm of SVB Financial, which focuses primarily on funds management. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. We have a controlling and significant variable interest in   five   of these SVB Capital funds and consolidate these funds for financial reporting purposes. 
  All investments are generally nonredeemable and distributions are expected to be received through the liquidation of the underlying investments throughout the life of the investment fund. Investments may be sold or transferred subject to the notice and approval provisions of the underlying investment agreement. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule, we also make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, but are not obligated to fund commitments beyond our initial investment. For additional details, see Note 12 "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments" of the "Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
  The Bank also has variable interests in low income housing tax credit funds, in connection with fulfilling its responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. These investments are typically limited partnerships in which the general partner, other than the Bank, holds the power over significant activities of the VIE; therefore, these investments are not consolidated. For additional information on our investments in qualified affordable housing projects see Note 6  Investment Securities" of the "Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)" under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our exposure to loss with respect to the consolidated VIEs is limited to our net assets of   $208.3 million   and our exposure to loss for our unconsolidated VIEs is equal to our investment in these assets of   $312.7 million  .

     Our investment securities portfolio consists of: (i) an available-for-sale securities portfolio and a held-to-maturity securities portfolio, both of which represent interest-earning investment securities, and, (ii) a non-marketable and other securities portfolio, which primarily represents investments managed as part of our funds management business. 
  Available-for-Sale Securities 
  The components of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

The following table summarizes our unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio into categories of less than 12 months and 12 months or longer as of   September 30, 2016  :

    As of   September 30, 2016  , we identified a total of   103   investments that were in unrealized loss positions, of which   14   investments totaling   $247.1 million   with unrealized losses of   $2.1 million   have been in an impaired position for a period of time greater than 12 months. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not intend to sell any impaired fixed income investment securities prior to recovery of our adjusted cost basis, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell any of our securities prior to recovery of our adjusted cost basis. Based on our analysis as of   September 30, 2016  , we deem all impairments to be temporary, and therefore changes in value for our temporarily impaired securities as of the same date are included in other comprehensive income. Market valuations and impairment analyses on assets in the available-for-sale securities portfolio are reviewed and monitored on a quarterly basis. 
     The following table summarizes our unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio into categories of less than 12 months and 12 months or longer as of   December 31, 2015  :

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income investment securities classified as available-for-sale as of   September 30, 2016  . The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities, which are reported at fair value. For U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale typically have original contractual maturities from   10   to   30   years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

    Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses 
     We serve a variety of commercial clients in the technology, life science/healthcare, private equity/venture capital and premium wine industries. Our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (semiconductors, communications and electronics), software and related services, and energy and resource innovation ("ERI"). Because of the diverse nature of ERI products and services, for our loan-related reporting purposes, ERI-related loans are reported under our hardware, software and internet, life science/healthcare and other commercial loan categories, as applicable. Our life science/healthcare clients primarily tend to be in the industries of biotechnology, medical devices, healthcare information technology and healthcare services. Loans made to private equity/venture capital firm clients typically enable them to fund investments  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

prior to their receipt of funds from capital calls. Loans to the premium wine industry focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and wines of high quality. 
  In addition to commercial loans, we make consumer loans through SVB Private Bank and provide real estate secured loans to eligible employees through our EHOP. Our private banking clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders in the innovation companies they support. These products and services include real estate secured home equity lines of credit, which may be used to finance real estate investments and loans used to purchase, renovate or refinance personal residences. These products and services also include restricted stock purchase loans and capital call lines of credit.  
  We also provide community development loans made as part of our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act. These loans are included within  Construction loans  below and are primarily secured by real estate. 
  The composition of loans, net of unearned income of   $117 million   and   $115 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is presented in the following table:

Credit Quality Indicators 
  For each individual client, we establish an internal credit risk rating for that loan, which is used for assessing and monitoring credit risk as well as performance of the loan and the overall portfolio. Our internal credit risk ratings are also used to summarize the risk of loss due to failure by an individual borrower to repay the loan. For our internal credit risk ratings, each individual loan is given a risk rating of 1 through 10. Loans risk-rated 1 through 4 are performing loans and translate to an internal rating of  Pass , with loans risk-rated 1 being cash secured. Loans risk-rated 5 through 7 are performing loans, however, we consider them as demonstrating higher risk, which requires more frequent review of the individual exposures; these translate to an internal rating of  Performing (Criticized) . When a significant payment delay occurs on a criticized loan, the loan is impaired. The loan is also considered for nonaccrual status if full repayment is determined to be improbable. All of our nonaccrual loans are risk-rated 8 or 9 and are classified under the nonperforming impaired category. (For further description of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  under Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K). Loans rated 10 are charged-off and are not included as part of our loan portfolio balance. We review our credit quality indicators for performance and appropriateness of risk ratings as part of our evaluation process for our allowance for loan losses.

TDRs 
  As of   September 30, 2016   we had   19   TDRs with a total carrying value of   $76.0 million   where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, in an attempt to maximize collection. There were   $4.7 million   of unfunded commitments available for funding to the clients associated with these TDRs as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  The following table summarizes our loans modified in TDRs, broken out by portfolio segment and class of financing receivables at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table summarizes the recorded investment in loans modified in TDRs, broken out by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable, for modifications made during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    There were   $0.7 million   and   $3.5 million   of partial charge-offs during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $22.4 million   of partial charge-offs for loans classified as TDRs in our software and internet loan portfolio during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
     During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , new TDRs of   $12.0 million    and   $17.6 million  , respectively, were modified through payment deferrals granted to our clients. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , new TDRs of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, were modified through partial forgiveness of principal.  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , new TDRs of   $81.8 million    and   $89.8 million  , respectively, were modified through payment deferrals granted to our clients.  
  The related allowance for loan losses for the majority of our TDRs is determined on an individual basis by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the pre-modification contractual

interest rate. For certain TDRs, the related allowance for loan losses is determined based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 
  The following table summarizes the recorded investment in loans modified in TDRs within the previous 12 months that subsequently defaulted during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Charge-offs and defaults on previously restructured loans are evaluated to determine the impact to the allowance for loan losses, if any. The evaluation of these defaults may impact the assumptions used in calculating the reserve on other TDRs and impaired loans as well as management s overall outlook of macroeconomic factors that affect the reserve on the loan portfolio as a whole. After evaluating the charge-offs and defaults experienced on our TDRs we determined that no change to our reserving methodology was necessary to determine the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016  .

Interest expense is net of the hedge accounting impact from our interest rate swap agreement related to our 6.05% Subordinated Notes.  The weighted average interest rate associated with our short-term borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 was   0.40 percent   and   0.32 percent  , respectively.

Available Lines of Credit 
  We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured (using high-quality fixed income securities as collateral) and an unsecured basis. These include repurchase agreements and uncommitted federal funds lines with various financial institutions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not borrow against our uncommitted federal funds lines. We also pledge securities to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. The market value of collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco (comprised primarily of U.S. Treasury securities) at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $1.8 billion  , all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. The market value of collateral pledged at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $0.8 billion  , all of which was also unused and available to support additional borrowings. 
   
           9. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
     We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Also, in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and changes in market interest rates. To manage interest rate risk for our 6.05% Subordinated Notes, we entered into a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreement at the time of debt issuance based upon LIBOR with matched-terms. The net cash benefit associated with our interest rate swap is recorded as a reduction in  Interest expense Borrowings,  a component of net interest income. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is calculated using a discounted cash flow method and adjusted for credit valuation associated with counterparty risk. Changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in either other assets (for swaps in an asset position) or other liabilities (for swaps in a liability position). 
  We assess hedge effectiveness under ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , using the long-haul method. Any differences associated with our interest rate swap that arise as a result of hedge ineffectiveness are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. 
  Currency Exchange Risk 
  We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure risk associated with the net difference between foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.  We do not designate any foreign exchange forward contracts as derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. Gains or losses from changes in currency rates on foreign currency denominated instruments are included in other noninterest income, a component of noninterest income. We may experience ineffectiveness in the economic hedging relationship, because the instruments are revalued based upon changes in the currency s spot rate on the principal value, while the forwards are revalued on a discounted cash flow basis. We record forward agreements in gain positions in other assets and loss positions in other liabilities, while net changes in fair value are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.  
  Other Derivative Instruments 
  Also included in our derivative instruments are equity warrant assets and client forward and option contracts, and client interest rate contracts. For further description of these other derivative instruments, refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" under Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Counterparty Credit Risk 
  We are exposed to credit risk if counterparties to our derivative contracts do not perform as expected. We mitigate counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and obtaining collateral, as appropriate. With respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for derivative instruments, we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net risk basis by counterparty portfolio.

    Cash collateral received from our counterparties in relation to market value exposures of derivative contracts in our favor is recorded as a component of  short-term borrowings  on our consolidated balance sheets. 
              (2) 
    Net exposure for contracts in a gain position reflects the replacement cost in the event of nonperformance by all such counterparties. The credit ratings of our institutional counterparties as of   September 30, 2016   remain at investment grade or higher and there were no material changes in their credit ratings during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

We have   three   reportable segments for management reporting purposes: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital. The results of our operating segments are based on our internal management reporting process.  
  Our Global Commercial Bank and SVB Private Bank segments' primary source of revenue is from net interest income, which is primarily the difference between interest earned on loans, net of funds transfer pricing ( FTP ), and interest paid on deposits, net of FTP. Accordingly, these segments are reported using net interest income, net of FTP. FTP is an internal measurement framework designed to assess the financial impact of a financial institution s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which a funding credit is given for deposits raised, and a funding charge is made for loans funded. FTP is calculated at an instrument level based on account characteristics. 
  We also evaluate performance based on provision for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of segment operating profit or loss. In calculating each operating segment s noninterest expense, we consider the direct costs incurred by the operating segment as well as certain allocated direct costs. As part of this review, we allocate certain corporate overhead costs to a corporate account. We do not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally, our management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances; therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented

for segment reporting purposes. Changes in an individual client s primary relationship designation have resulted, and in the future may result, in the inclusion of certain clients in different segments in different periods. 
  Unlike financial reporting, which benefits from the comprehensive structure provided by GAAP, our internal management reporting process is highly subjective, as there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our management reporting process measures the performance of our operating segments based on our internal operating structure, which is subject to change from time to time, and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial services companies. 
  For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has three operating segments for which we report our financial information: 
             
    Global Commercial Bank   is comprised of results from the following: 
                
    Our   Commercial Bank   products and services are provided by the Bank and its subsidiaries to commercial clients in the technology, life science/healthcare and private equity/venture capital industries. The Bank provides solutions to the financial needs of commercial clients, through credit, global treasury management, foreign exchange, global trade finance, and other services. It serves clients within the United States, as well as non-U.S. clients in key international innovation markets. In addition, the Bank and its subsidiaries offer a variety of investment services and solutions to its clients that enable them to effectively manage their assets.   
                
    Our   Private Equity Division   provides banking products and services primarily to our private equity and venture capital clients. 
                
    Our   Wine   practice provides banking products and services to our premium wine industry clients, including vineyard development loans.  
                
    SVB Analytics   provides equity valuation services to companies and private equity/venture capital firms. 
                
    Debt Fund Investments   is comprised of our investments in certain debt funds in which we are a strategic investor. 
                
    SVB Private Bank   is the private banking division of the Bank, which provides a range of personal financial solutions for consumers. Our clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. We offer a customized suite of private banking services, including mortgages, home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit and other secured and unsecured lending, as well as cash and wealth management services.   
                
    SVB Capital   is the venture capital investment arm of SVBFG, which focuses primarily on funds management. SVB Capital manages funds (primarily venture capital funds) on behalf of third party limited partners and, on a more limited basis, SVB Financial Group. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. SVB Capital generates income for the Company primarily from investment returns (including carried interest) and management fees. 
     The summary financial results of our operating segments are presented along with a reconciliation to our consolidated interim results.  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

Our segment information for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

(1) 
    Global Commercial Bank s and SVB Capital s components of net interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense and total average assets are shown net of noncontrolling interests for all periods presented. Noncontrolling interest is included within "Other Items". 
              (2) 
    The "Other Items" column reflects the adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of the operating segments to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Net interest income consists primarily of interest earned from our fixed income investment portfolio, net of FTP. Noninterest income consists primarily of gains on equity warrant assets and gains on the sale of fixed income securities. Noninterest expense consists primarily of expenses associated with corporate support functions such as finance, human resources, marketing, legal and other expenses.

    The internal reporting model used by management to assess segment performance does not calculate income tax expense by segment. Our effective tax rate is a reasonable approximation of the segment rates. 
              (5) 
    Total average assets equal the greater of total average assets or the sum of total average liabilities and total average stockholders  equity for each segment to reconcile the results to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. 
      
           12. 
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments 
     In the normal course of business we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit and commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity fund investments. These instruments involve credit risk to varying degrees. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. 
  Commitments to Extend Credit 
  The following table summarizes information related to our commitments to extend credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Represents commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all collateral, compliance and financial covenants required under loan commitment agreements. 
              (2) 
    See below for additional information on our commercial and standby letters of credit. 
              (3) 
    Represents commitments which are currently unavailable for funding, due to clients failing to meet all collateral, compliance and financial covenants under loan commitment agreements. 
              (4) 
    We extend credit under accounts receivable factoring arrangements when our clients  sales invoices are deemed creditworthy under existing underwriting practices. 
              (5) 
    Our reserve for unfunded credit commitments includes an allowance for both our unfunded loan commitments and our letters of credit. 
     Commercial and Standby Letters of Credit 
  The table below summarizes our commercial and standby letters of credit at   September 30, 2016  . The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that could be remitted under letters of credit if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

Deferred fees related to financial and performance standby letters of credit were   $10 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , collateral in the form of cash of   $747 million   was available to us to reimburse losses, if any, under financial and performance standby letters of credit. 
  Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds 
  Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule, we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a   10  -year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling   100%   of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over   5   to   7   years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call 100% of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. The following table details our total capital commitments, unfunded capital commitments, and our ownership percentage in each fund at   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Our ownership includes direct ownership of   1.3   percent and indirect ownership interest of   3.8   percent through our investment in SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP. 
              (2) 
    Our ownership includes direct ownership of   41.5 percent   and indirect ownership interests of   12.6 percent   and   4.1 percent   in the fund through our ownership interest of SVB Capital - NT Growth Partners, LP and SVB Capital Preferred Return Fund, LP, respectively. 
              (3) 
    Represents commitments to   265   funds (primarily venture capital funds) where our ownership interest is generally less than   5 percent   of the voting interests of each such fund. 
              (4) 
    We are subject to the Volcker Rule, which restricts or limits us from sponsoring or having ownership interests in  covered  funds including venture capital and private equity funds. See  Business - Supervision and Regulation  under Item 1 of Part I of our 2015 Form 10-K.

We are subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions and have identified our federal tax return and tax returns in California and Massachusetts as major tax filings. Our U.S. federal tax returns for 2013 and subsequent years remain open to full examination. Our California and Massachusetts tax returns for 2011 and subsequent tax years remain open to full examination.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , our unrecognized tax benefit was   $3.1 million  , the recognition of which would reduce our income tax expense by   $2.0 million  . We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefit will materially change in the next 12 months. 
  We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income before income taxes. Interest and penalties were not material for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
     Fair Value Measurements 
  Our available-for-sale securities, derivative instruments and certain non-marketable and other securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing our interim consolidated financial statements. 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There is a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of those inputs in the fair value measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data and views of market participants. The three levels for measuring fair value are based on the reliability of inputs and are as follows: 
  Level 1 
  Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. Treasury securities, exchange-traded equity securities and certain marketable securities accounted for under fair value accounting. 
  Level 2 
  Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, directly or indirectly. Valuations for the available-for-sale securities are provided by independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities and by comparison to and/or average of quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers. We perform a monthly analysis on the values received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and ongoing review of third party pricing methodologies, review of pricing trends and monitoring of trading volumes. Additional corroboration, such as obtaining a non-binding price from a broker, may be obtained depending on the frequency of trades of the security and the level of liquidity or depth of the market. We ensure prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value through the use of observable market inputs including comparable trades, yield curve, spreads and, when available, market indices. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines that there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data, the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly. Below is a summary of the significant inputs used for each class of Level 2 assets and liabilities: 
  U.S. agency debentures:   Fair value measurements of U.S. agency debentures are based on the characteristics specific to bonds held, such as issuer name, coupon rate, maturity date and any applicable issuer call option features. Valuations are based on market spreads relative to similar term benchmark market interest rates, generally U.S. Treasury securities. 
  Agency-issued mortgage-backed securities:   Agency-issued mortgage-backed securities are pools of individual conventional mortgage loans underwritten to U.S. agency standards with similar coupon rates, tenor, and other attributes such as geographic location, loan size and origination vintage. Fair value measurements of these securities are based on observable price adjustments relative to benchmark market interest rates taking into consideration estimated loan prepayment speeds. 
  Agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations:   Agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations are structured into classes or tranches with defined cash flow characteristics and are collateralized by U.S. agency-issued mortgage pass-through securities. Fair value measurements of these securities incorporate similar characteristics of mortgage pass-through securities such as coupon rate, tenor, geographic location, loan size and origination vintage, in addition to incorporating  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

the effect of estimated prepayment speeds on the cash flow structure of the class or tranche. These measurements incorporate observable market spreads over an estimated average life after considering the inputs listed above. 
  Agency-issued commercial mortgage-backed securities:   Fair value measurements of these securities are based on spreads to benchmark market interest rates (usually U.S. Treasury rates or rates observable in the swaps market), prepayment speeds, loan default rate assumptions and loan loss severity assumptions on underlying loans. 
  Municipal bonds and notes:   Bonds issued by municipal governments generally have stated coupon rates, final maturity dates and are subject to being called ahead of the final maturity date at the option of the issuer. Fair value measurements of these securities are priced based on spreads to other municipal benchmark bonds with similar characteristics; or, relative to market rates on U.S. Treasury bonds of similar maturity. 
  Interest rate derivative assets and liabilities:   Fair value measurements of interest rate derivatives are priced considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg of the contract and the variable coupon on the floating leg of the contract. Valuation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve and the credit worthiness of the contract counterparty. 
  Foreign exchange forward and option contract assets and liabilities:   Fair value measurements of these assets and liabilities are priced based on spot and forward foreign currency rates and option volatility assumptions. 
  Equity warrant assets (public portfolio):   Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions. 
  Level 3 
  The fair value measurement is derived from valuation techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset. Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used for each class of Level 3 assets: 
  Other venture capital investments:   Fair value measurements are based on consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, and as it relates to the private company, the current and projected operating performance, exit strategies and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement include the information about each portfolio company, including actual and forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies. Significant changes to any one of these inputs in isolation could result in a significant change in the fair value measurement, however, we generally consider all factors available through ongoing communication with the portfolio companies and venture capital fund managers to determine whether there are changes to the portfolio company or the environment that indicate a change in the fair value measurement. 
  Other securities:   Fair value measurements of equity securities of public companies are priced based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Marketability discounts generally range from   10%   to   20%   depending on the duration of the sale restrictions which typically range from   3   to   6   months. 
  Equity warrant assets (public portfolio):   Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions. Modeled asset values are further adjusted by applying a discount of up to   20%   for certain warrants that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted. As a lock-up term nears, and other sale restrictions are lifted, discounts are adjusted downward to   zero   percent once all restrictions expire or are removed. 
  Equity warrant assets (private portfolio):   Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of private portfolio companies are priced based on a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the asset value by using stated strike prices, option expiration dates, risk-free interest rates and option volatility assumptions. Option volatility assumptions used in the modified Black-Scholes model are based on public market indices whose members operate in similar industries as companies in our private company portfolio. Option expiration dates are modified to account for estimates to actual life relative to stated expiration. Overall model asset values are further adjusted for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. There is a direct correlation between changes in the volatility and remaining life assumptions in isolation and the fair value measurement while there is an inverse correlation between changes in the liquidity discount assumption and the fair value measurement.

     Table of Contents  

It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon valuation techniques that use primarily market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. Substantially all of our financial instruments use the foregoing methodologies, and are categorized as a Level 1 or Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for our valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions we believe market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, and based on the significance of those judgments, the measurement may be determined to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
  The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3.

    In determining the fair value of our other venture capital investment portfolio, we evaluate a variety of factors related to each underlying private portfolio company including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies. Additionally, we have ongoing communication with the portfolio companies and venture capital fund managers, to determine whether there is a material change in fair value. These factors are specific to each portfolio company and a weighted average or range of values of the unobservable inputs is not meaningful. 
              (2) 
    We adjust quoted market prices of public companies, which are subject to certain sales restrictions. Sales restriction discounts generally range from   10%   to   20%   depending on the duration of the sales restrictions, which typically range from   3   to   6   months.

    Our marketability discount is applied to all private company warrants to account for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. The quantitative measure used is based upon various option-pricing models. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our marketability discount.  
              (4) 
    We adjust the contractual remaining term of private company warrants based on our estimate of the actual remaining life, which we determine by utilizing historical data on cancellations and exercises. At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average contractual remaining term was   5.9   years, compared to our estimated remaining life of   2.7   years. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our remaining life assumption.  
     For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 or transfers between Level 3 and Level 1. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were due primarily due to the expiration of lock-up, and other sales restrictions on certain of our public warrant positions. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were due to the transfer of equity warrant assets from our private portfolio to our public portfolio (see our Level 3 reconciliation above). All amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the date of the change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
  Financial Instruments not Carried at Fair Value 
  FASB guidance over financial instruments requires that we disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments not carried at fair value. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for our financial instruments, are made solely to comply with these requirements. 
  Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at the transaction level using present value techniques in instances where quoted market prices are not available. As broadly traded markets do not exist for many of our financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific time. The aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company. 
  The following describes the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value and estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and excludes financial instruments and assets and liabilities already recorded at fair value as described above. 
  Financial Instruments for which Carrying Value Approximates Fair Value 
  Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents; FHLB and FRB stock; accrued interest receivable; short-term borrowings; short-term time deposits; and accrued interest payable. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.  
    
  Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Held-to-Maturity Securities 
  Held-to-maturity securities include similar investments held in our available-for-sale securities portfolio and are valued using the same methodologies. All securities included in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio are valued using Level 2 inputs. Refer to Level 2 fair value measurements above for significant inputs used in the valuation of our held-to-maturity investment securities. 
  Non-Marketable Securities (Cost and Equity Method Accounting) 
  Non-marketable securities includes other investments (equity method accounting), venture capital and private equity fund investments (cost method accounting), and other venture capital investments (cost method accounting). Other investments (equity method accounting) includes our investment in SPD-SVB, our joint venture bank in China. At this time, the carrying value of our investment in SPD-SVB is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of the remaining other investments (equity method accounting) and the fair value of venture capital and private equity fund investments (cost method accounting) and other venture capital investments (cost method accounting) is based on financial information obtained from the investee or obtained from the fund investments  or debt fund investments  respective general partners. For private company investments, estimated fair value is based on consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as obtained from the general partners of the investments. We adjust the net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment s net

asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example June 30   th   , for our September 30   th    consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period.  
  Loans 
  The fair value of fixed and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using rates that reflect current pricing for similar loans and the projected forward yield curve. This method is not based on the exit price concept of fair value required under ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  . 
  Long-Term Deposits 
  The fair value of long-term time deposits is estimated by discounting the cash flows using our cost of borrowings and the projected forward yield curve over their remaining contractual term. 
  Long-Term Debt 
  The fair value of long-term debt is generally based on quoted market prices, when available, or is estimated based on calculations utilizing third-party pricing services and current market spread, price indications from reputable dealers or observable market prices of the underlying instrument(s), whichever is deemed more reliable. Also included in the estimated fair value of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes are amounts related to hedge accounting associated with the notes.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
  The fair value of net available commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the average amount we would receive or pay to execute a new agreement with identical terms and pricing, while taking into account the counterparties  credit standing. 
  Letters of credit are carried at their fair value, which was equivalent to the residual premium or fee at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit typically result in loans with a market interest rate if funded. 
  The following fair value hierarchy table presents the estimated fair values of our financial instruments that are not carried at fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    In accordance with the accounting standard (ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)), certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.  
              (2) 
    Includes noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts and interest-bearing sweep deposits. 
              (3) 
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , included in the carrying value and estimated fair value of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes was an interest rate swap valued at   $1.3 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively, related to hedge accounting associated with the notes. 
       
  Investments in Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share 
  FASB guidance over certain fund investments requires that we disclose the fair value of funds, significant investment strategies of the investees, redemption features of the investees, restrictions on the ability to sell investments, estimate of the period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated by the investee, and unfunded commitments related to the investments. 
  Our investments in debt funds and venture capital and private equity fund investments generally cannot be redeemed. Alternatively, we expect distributions, if any, to be received primarily through IPO and M A activity of the underlying assets of the fund. Subject to applicable requirements under the Volcker Rule, we do not have any plans to sell any of these fund investments. If we decide to sell these investments in the future, the investee fund s management must approve of the buyer before the sale of the investments can be completed. The fair values of the fund investments have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments, adjusted for any differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example June 30   th   , for our September 30   th    consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period. 
  The following table is a summary of the estimated fair values of these investments and remaining unfunded commitments for each major category of these investments as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Venture capital and private equity fund investments within non-marketable securities (fair value accounting) include investments made by our managed funds of funds and one of our direct venture funds. These investments represent investments in venture capital and private equity funds that invest primarily in U.S. and global technology and life science/healthcare companies. Included in the fair value and unfunded commitments of fund investments under fair value accounting are   $101 million   and   $4 million  , respectively, attributable to noncontrolling interests. It is estimated that we will receive distributions from the fund investments over the next   10   to   13   years, depending on the age of the funds and any potential extensions of terms of the funds. 
              (2) 
    Venture capital and private equity fund investments, debt funds, and other fund investments within non-marketable securities (equity and cost method accounting) include funds that invest in or lend money to primarily U.S. and global technology and life science/healthcare companies. It is estimated that we will receive distributions from the funds over the next   10   to   13   years, depending on the age of the funds and any potential extensions of the terms of the funds.

Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against us or our affiliates. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish accruals for all lawsuits, claims and expected settlements when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrual. Any such loss estimates are inherently uncertain, based on currently available information and are subject to management s judgment and various assumptions. Due to the inherent subjectivity of these estimates and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate resolution of such matters. 
  To the extent we believe any potential loss relating to such lawsuits and claims may have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole and is reasonably possible but not probable, we disclose information relating to any such potential loss, whether in excess of any established accruals or where there is no established accrual. We also disclose information relating to any material potential loss that is probable but not reasonably estimable. Where reasonably practicable, we will provide an estimate of loss or range of potential loss. No disclosures are generally made for any loss contingencies that are deemed to be remote. 
  Based upon information available to us, our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date and consultation with our outside legal counsel, we have not recognized a material accrual liability for these matters, nor do we currently expect it is reasonably possible that these matters will result in a material liability to the Company. However, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of such matters currently pending or threatened could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole, in the future. 
   
   During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Bank made loans to related parties, including certain companies in which certain of our directors or their affiliated venture funds are beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the equity securities of such companies. Such loans: (a) were made in the ordinary course of business; (b) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other non-related persons; and (c) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. Additionally, we also provide real estate secured loans to eligible employees through our EHOP.

  Management s Overview of   Third   Quarter   2016   Performance 
  Overall, we had a solid   third   quarter in   2016  , which was marked by healthy loan growth, stable credit quality, solid core fee income and higher investment and warrant gains. Our core business continues to perform well as a result of our ongoing focus on innovation companies and their investors and continued efforts to secure client relationships. We saw continued success in working with private equity/venture capital firms as well as growth of our private bank offerings to private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. 
  A summary of our performance for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   (compared to   September 30, 2015  , where applicable) is as follows:

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The accompanying management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  There have been no significant changes during the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016   to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  under Part II, Item 7 of our   2015   Form 10-K.

  Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis) 
  Net interest income is defined as the difference between interest earned on loans, fixed income investment portfolio (available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities), short-term investment securities and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is our principal source of revenue. Net interest margin is defined as the amount of annualized net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent.                   
  Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis) 
  Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as  volume change.  Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as  rate change.  The following table sets forth changes in interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the periods indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis) 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net interest income increased by $34.4 million to   $289.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $255.0 million   for the comparable   2015   period. Overall, our net interest income increased primarily from interest earned on loans, reflective of higher average loan balances driven by strong growth in average loan balances. 
  The main factors affecting interest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the comparable   2015   period are discussed below: 
              
    A $39.2 million increase in interest income on loans to   $214.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $175.0 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of   $3.7 billion  , partially offset by a decrease in both gross loan yields and loan fee yields. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, decreased to 3.93 percent from 3.99 percent, reflective of a shift in the mix of our overall loan portfolio from the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by the 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in December 2015. The shift in the mix of loans primarily reflects growth in private equity/venture capital and SVB Private Bank loans, which tend to be higher credit quality, lower yielding loans. Loan fee yields decreased five basis points to 61 basis points, from 66 basis points in the comparable 2015 period. This decrease was a result of lower amortizing fee income as a percentage of our overall loan portfolio, primarily reflective of the growth of our private equity/venture capital and SVB Private Bank loans which tend to have lower fees. 
                
    A $4.4 million decrease in interest income on fixed income investment securities to   $84.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $88.7 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The decrease was reflective primarily of a decrease in average fixed income investment securities of $2.2 billion from the third quarter of 2015, as a result of our $2.9 billion sales of investment securities during the first and second  
     
   59 

     Table of Contents  

quarters of 2016 to fund loans and repay short-term borrowings. The decrease was partially offset by lower premium amortization expense, reflective of higher market interest rates in 2016. 
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net interest income increased by $116.3 million to $854.8 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to $738.6 million for the comparable   2015   period. Overall, our net interest income increased primarily from interest earned on loans, reflective of higher average loan balances driven by strong growth in average loan balances. 
  The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the comparable   2015   period are discussed below: 
              
    A $109.7 million increase in interest income on loans to $617.5 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to $507.7 million for the comparable   2015   period. The increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $3.5 billion, partially offset by a decrease in both gross loan yields and loan fee yields.  Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, decreased to 3.99 percent from 4.03 percent, reflective of a shift in the mix of our overall loan portfolio since the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by the 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in December 2015. The shift in the mix of loans primarily reflects growth in private equity/venture capital and SVB Private Bank loans, which tend to be higher credit quality, lower yielding loans. Loan fee yields decreased eight basis points to 58 basis points, from 66 basis points in the comparable 2015 period. This decrease was a result of lower amortizing fee income as a percentage of our overall loan portfolio, primarily reflective of the growth of our private equity/venture capital and SVB Private Bank loans which tend to have lower fees. 
                
    A $6.8 million increase in interest income on fixed income investment securities to $263.7 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to $256.9 million for the comparable   2015   period. The increase was driven primarily by a $5.0 million decrease in premium amortization expense, as well as a higher yield on our U.S. Treasury portfolio, both reflective of higher market interest rates. 
                
    Interest expense   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by $2.0 million primarily due to: 
                 
    An increase in short-term borrowings interest expense of $1.0 million, due primarily to borrowings from our available line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") in 2016 in order to support loan growth and the liquidity needs of the Bank. 
     Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis) 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
             
    Our net interest margin increased by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   2.50   percent for the comparable   2015   period. The higher margin during the third quarter of 2016 was reflective primarily of a shift in the mix of our average interest-earning assets towards our loan portfolio. The shift was reflective of the utilization of fixed income investment securities to fund loan growth in 2016 as a result of the tempered growth in average deposits. Average loans represented 45 percent of interest earning assets for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 37 percent for the comparable   2015   period. 
     Nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
             
    Our net interest margin increased by 15 basis points to   2.72 percent   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   2.57 percent   for the comparable   2015   period. The higher margin during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was reflective primarily of a shift in the mix of our average interest-earning assets towards our loan portfolio. The shift was reflective of the utilization of fixed income investment securities to fund loan growth in 2016 as a result of the tempered growth in average deposits. Average loans represented 43 percent of interest earning assets for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 38 percent for the comparable   2015   period

Provision for Loan Losses 
  The following table summarizes our allowance for loan losses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Reflects foreign currency translation adjustments within the allowance for loan losses.  Prior period amounts were previously reported with loan recoveries and have been revised to conform to current period presentation. 
     Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Our provision for loan losses is a function of our reserve methodology, which is used to determine an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the period.  Our reserve methodology is based on our evaluation of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total gross loans using historical and other objective information, and on our qualitative assessment of the inherent and identified credit risk of the loan portfolio. See  Consolidated Financial Condition Credit Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses  below and Note 7  Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses  of the  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  under Part I, Item 1 of this report for further details on our allowance for loan losses. 
  Our provision for loan losses was   $19.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a provision of   $33.4 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The provision of   $19.0 million   primarily reflected an $8.0 million increase in reserves for performing loans, $5.5 million for charge-offs that did not previously have a specific reserve, $4.0 million net reserves for nonaccrual loans and $2.8 million for loan growth. The net increase in reserves for nonaccrual loans included a $5.5 million partial reserve release for one of our non-performing sponsored buyout loans due to credit improvement.  
  The provision for loan losses of   $33.4 million   for the third quarter of 2015 was driven primarily by $17.8 million of additional specific reserves on two new nonaccrual loans, $10.4 million from the increase in period-end loan balances and an additional $3.8 million for the unreserved portion of a software and internet loan charge-off during the quarter. 
  Gross loan charge-offs of   $24.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   included $14.2 million from two late-stage clients, all of which had been fully reserved. Remaining charge-offs were primarily from early-stage clients in our software and internet and hardware loan portfolios, primarily as a result of the recalibration of venture capital investment levels and activities from the first half of the year. 
  Gross loan charge-offs of $29.1 million for the third quarter of 2015 included $21.7 million from one Growth stage client in our software and internet loan portfolio, of which a total of $17.9 million was previously reserved for in prior quarters. 
  Net loan charge-offs of   $22.5 million   represented   0.48   percent of average total gross loans, compared to net charge-offs of   $28.5 million  , or   0.75   percent of average total gross loans for the comparable   2015   period. The decrease in net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average total gross loans was reflective primarily of the decrease in gross loan charge-offs as discussed above.

Nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Our provision for loan losses was   $88.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a provision of   $66.4 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The provision of   $88.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was reflective primarily of $33.0 million in charge-offs that did not previously have a specific reserve and $23.0 million from period-end loan growth, with the remaining provision due primarily to reserves for new nonaccrual loans.  
  The provision for loan losses of $66.4 million for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015 was driven by $34.2 million for net charge-offs, an increase of $31.2 million in the reserve for nonaccrual loans and $8.5 million from period-end loan growth. These increases were offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in the reserve for our performing loans due to improved credit quality. 
  Gross loan charge-offs of   $71.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included $35.4 million from our early-stage loan portfolio and $27.6 million from four late-stage client loans.  These charge-offs were primarily from our software and internet loan portfolio. Gross loan charge-offs of $39.4 million for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015 came primarily from our software and internet loan portfolio, primarily as a result of the recalibration of venture capital investment levels and activities from the first half of the year. 
  Net loan charge-offs of   $63.3 million   represented   0.47 percent   of average total gross loans, compared to net charge-offs of   $34.1 million  , or   0.31 percent   of average total gross loans for the comparable   2015   period. 
   
  Noninterest Income 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , noninterest income was   $144.1 million   and   $343.1 million  , respectively, compared to   $108.5 million   and   $358.3 million  , for the comparable   2015   periods. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests was   $139.5 million   and   $339.4 million  , respectively, compared to   $102.1 million   and   $329.2 million  , for the comparable   2015   periods. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , non-GAAP core fee income was   $80.5 million   and   $231.5 million  , respectively, compared to   $68.4 million   and   $192.7 million   for the comparable   2015   periods. (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used below under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".) 
  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  To supplement our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance (including, but not limited to, non-GAAP core fee income, non-GAAP noninterest income, non-GAAP net gains on investment securities). These supplemental performance measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement.  
  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding items that represent income attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries and other certain non-recurring items. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognize, as part of our investment funds management business through SVB Capital, the entire income or loss from funds consolidated in accordance with ASC Topic 810 as discussed in Note 1  "Basis of Presentation" of the "Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)" under Part I, Item 1 in this report. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of the results of these entities, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than us are reflected under  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests  on our statements of income. Where applicable, the tables below for noninterest income and net gains on investment securities exclude noncontrolling interests.  
  Core fee income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control.  Core fee income includes foreign exchange fees, deposit service charges, credit card fees, lending related fees, client investment fees and letters of credit fees.

    Non-GAAP core fee income represents noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control and includes foreign exchange fees, credit card fees, deposit service charges, lending related fees, client investment fees and letters of credit fees. 
     Gains on Investment Securities, Net 
  Net gains and losses on investment securities include gains and losses from our non-marketable and other securities, as well as gains and losses from sales of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, when applicable. 
  Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is primarily a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Sales of equity securities held as a result of our exercised warrants, result in net gains or losses on investment securities. These sales are conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy related to the management of our liquidity position and interest rate risk. Though infrequent, sales of investment securities in our AFS securities portfolio may result in net gains or losses and are also conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy.   
  Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, our China Joint Venture, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and other securities from quarter to quarter, which results in net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a number of factors, including unrealized changes in the values of our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains and losses from distributions, changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains or losses from non-marketable and other securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes, and are therefore subject to potential increases or decreases in future periods. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains or losses from investment securities. As such, our results for a particular period are not necessarily indicative of our expected performance in a future period. 
  The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain sales restrictions to which these equity securities may be subject to (i.e. lock-up agreements), changes in prevailing market prices, market conditions, the actual sales or distributions of securities, the timing of such actual sales or distributions, which, to the extent such securities are managed by our managed funds, are subject to our funds' separate discretionary sales/distributions and governance processes.

Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had net gains on investment securities of   $23.2 million  , compared to net gains of   $18.8 million     for the comparable   2015   period. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests, were   $18.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $12.7 million   for the comparable 2015 period.  
  Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests, of   $18.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were primarily driven by the following:  
             
    Gains of   $13.7 million   from our strategic and other investments portfolio, comprised of gains of $7.2 million from valuation increases for one of our equity method fund investments as well as higher distributions from our strategic venture capital fund investments, and 
                
    Gains of   $4.3 million   from our managed funds of funds portfolio, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases due to M A and IPO activity of investments held by the funds in the portfolio.  
       
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had net gains on investment securities of   $41.8 million  , compared to   $77.0 million   for the comparable   2015   period. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests, were   $38.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $47.7 million   for the comparable   2015   period. 
  The gains, net of noncontrolling interests, of   $38.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were primarily driven by the following: 
             
    Gains of   $24.0 million   from our strategic and other investments portfolio, attributable primarily to distribution gains from our strategic venture capital funds investments and net unrealized valuation increases in one of our equity method fund investments,  
                
    Gains of   $11.6 million   from our available-for-sale securities portfolio, primarily reflective of $13.8 million of net gains on the sale of approximately $2.9 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by $2.2 million of net losses on sales of shares from exercised warrants in public companies upon expiration of lock-up periods during 2016, and 
                
    Gains of   $2.2 million   from our managed funds of funds portfolio, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases due to M A and IPO activity of investments held by the funds in the portfolio.

  Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net gains on derivative instruments were   $19.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $10.2 million   for the comparable   2015   period. Net gains on derivative instruments were primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    Net gains on equity warrant assets of   $21.6 million  , which consisted of: 
                
    Net gains of   $16.8 million   from changes in warrant valuations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $8.9 million   for the comparable   2015   period, primarily reflective of a $10.3 million increase in the valuation of one public company as well as warrant valuation gains in our private company warrant portfolio, and 
                
    Net gains of   $5.9 million   from the exercise of equity warrant assets during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains   $2.2 million   for the comparable   2015   period, primarily reflective of increased IPO and M A activity in the portfolio.

Net losses of   $3.2 million   on client foreign exchange forward contracts used to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure to foreign currency denominated financial instruments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $0.2 million   for the comparable 2015 period. The net losses of   $3.2 million   were offset by net gains of   $3.5 million   from the revaluation of client foreign currency denominated instruments that are included in the line item "Other" within noninterest income below.  
                
    Net gains of   $1.4 million   on internal foreign exchange forward contracts used to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure to foreign currency denominated financial instruments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net losses of   $0.2 million   for the comparable 2015 period. The net gains of   $1.4 million   were driven by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies, during the third quarter of 2016 and were offset by net losses of $1.4 million from the revaluation of internal foreign currency denominated instruments that are included in the line item "Other" within noninterest income below.  
     Nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net gains on derivative instruments were   $26.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $66.3 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The net gains of $26.8 million on derivative instruments were primarily attributable to the following: 
              
    Net gains of   $22.0 million   from changes in warrant valuations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29.0 million   for the comparable 2015 period, primarily reflective of a $15.0 million increase in the valuation of one public company as well as warrant valuation gains in our private company warrant portfolio, due to IPO and M A activity in the portfolio, and 
                
    Net gains of   $13.8 million   from the exercise of equity warrant assets for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $26.4 million   for the comparable 2015 period, reflective primarily of M A activity.     
                
    Net losses of   $8.8 million   on client foreign exchange forward contracts for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $0.5 million   for the comparable 2015 period. The net losses of   $8.8 million   were partially offset by net gains of $7.0 million from the revaluation of client foreign currency denominated financial instruments that are included in the line item "Other" within noninterest income. Also contributing to the loss is a reclassification of $2.8 million in unrealized gains on forward contracts to foreign exchange fee income (included in non-GAAP core fee income above) reflecting fees earned on forward contracts executed on behalf of our clients, which were previously recorded in the line item   "Gains on derivative instruments, net." 
                
    Net gains of   $3.1 million   on internal foreign exchange forward contracts hedging certain of our foreign currency denominated instruments for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net gains of   $11.6 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The net gains recognized for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against various foreign currencies. The net gains of $3.1 million and $11.6 million were offset by net losses of $4.2 million and $11.7 million, respectively, from the revaluation of internal foreign currency denominated instruments that are included in the line item "Other" within noninterest income as noted below.

    This non-GAAP measure represents noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control.  See "Use of Non-GAAP Measures" above. 
       
  Foreign Exchange Fees 
  Foreign exchange fees were   $25.9 million   and   $77.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $23.0 million   and   $63.0 million   for the comparable   2015   periods. The increases in foreign exchange fees were due primarily to increased volume related to an increase in our client count and market volatility. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , a one-time reclassification of $2.9 million in foreign exchange fee income from noninterest income gains on derivative instruments also contributed to the increase.  
  Credit Card Fees

The increases reflect increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients. The increases were partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense. 
  Deposit Service Charges 
  Deposit service charges were   $13.4 million   and   $39.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $12.3 million   and   $34.3 million   for the comparable   2015   periods.

Total other noninterest income was   $20.7 million   and   $42.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to noninterest income of   $11.1 million   and   $22.3 million     for the comparable     2015     period. The increase of $9.6 million for the three months ended     September 30, 2016     was primarily due to net gains of $3.5 million on the revaluation of client foreign currency instruments during the third quarter of 2016 compared to net gains of $2 thousand for the comparable 2015 period. The net gains of $3.5 million for the three months ended     September 30, 2016     were driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies and were partially offset by net losses of $3.2 million in changes in the fair value of client foreign exchange forward contracts, which are included within noninterest in  come in the line item "Gains on derivative instruments, net" as noted above. Also contributing to the increase was $6.7 million in carried interest related to the equity method fund that drove the $7.2 million of gains previously mentioned.  
  The increase of $20.6 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to an increase in net gains on the revaluation of client and internal foreign currency instruments of $2.8 million for the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     compared to net losses of $11.8 million for the comparable     2015     period. Net gains of $2.8 million and net losses of $11.8 million for the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  , respectively, were offset by net losses of $5.7 million and net gains of $12.1 million in changes in the fair value of client and internal foreign exchange forward contracts, which are included within noninterest income in the line item "Gains on derivative instruments, net" as noted above.

  Non-GAAP Noninterest Expense 
  We use and report non-GAAP noninterest expense, non-GAAP taxable equivalent revenue and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, which excludes noncontrolling interests. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by: (i) excluding certain items that represent expenses attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries, or certain items that do not occur every reporting period; or (ii) providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The increases were due primarily to lease renewals at higher costs, reflective of market conditions, and the expansion of certain offices, primarily our UK office, to support our growth. 
  FDIC and State Assessments 
  FDIC and state assessments expense was   $7.8 million   and   $21.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.0 million   and   $18.7 million   for the comparable   2015   periods.

  Global Commercial Bank 

Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015    
  Income before income tax expense from our Global Commercial Bank ( GCB ) increased to   $165.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $116.7 million   for the comparable   2015   period, which reflected the continued growth of our core commercial business and clients. The key components of GCB's performance for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable   2015   period are discussed below. 
  Net interest income from GCB increased by   $44.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , due primarily to a $34.8 million increase in loan interest income resulting mainly from an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by lower yields. 
  GCB had a provision for loan losses of   $17.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32.1 million   for the comparable   2015   period. The provision of   $17.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was reflective primarily of $8.0 million increase in reserves for performing loans, $5.5 million in charge-offs that did not previously have a specific reserve, $3.0 million net reserves for nonaccrual loans and $2.8 million for loan growth. 
   The provision of   $32.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was driven primarily by an increase in the reserve for nonaccrual loans and period-end loan growth.    
  Noninterest income increased by   $10.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , related primarily to an increase in our core fees (higher credit card fees, foreign exchange fees and lending related fees). The increase in credit card fees was primarily reflective of increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients, partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense.     The increase in foreign exchange fees was due primarily to an increase in our client count as well as volume related to increased market volatility. The increase in lending related fees was due primarily to an increase in unused commitment fees associated with an increase in unfunded credit commitments.

Noninterest expense increased by   $21.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , due primarily to increased compensation and benefits and premises and equipment expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses and increased salaries and wages expenses. The increase in incentive compensation expenses reflects updated internal performance estimates for 2016. The increase in GCB salaries and wages expenses was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by 165 to 1,775 FTEs for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1,610 FTEs for the comparable 2015 period.

  Noninterest income increased by   $33.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , due primarily to an increase in all of our non-GAAP components of core fee income.  This increase was due primarily to the continued growth of our client base and work with larger global companies reflective of investments in our platform, capabilities and global reach. 
  Noninterest expense increased by   $39.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , due primarily to increased   expenses for compensation and benefits, premises and equipment, and net occupancy.

  SVB Capital s components of noninterest income primarily include net gains and losses on non-marketable and other securities, carried interest and fund management fees. All components of income before income tax expense and average assets discussed below are net of noncontrolling interests. 
  We experience variability in the performance of SVB Capital from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including changes in the values of our funds  underlying investments, changes in the amount of distributions and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains and losses from investment securities and cause our results to differ from period to period.  
  Three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015

  Our total assets, total liabilities and stockholders' equity were   $43.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $44.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of   $1.4 billion  , or   3.2 percent  . Below is a summary of the individual components driving the changes in total assets, total liabilities and stockholders' equity: 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents totaled   $2.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $1.0 billion  , or   67.7 percent  , compared to   $1.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in cash at period-end resulted from proceeds from the sales and maturities of U.S. Treasury securities, offset primarily by the increase in loans as well as decreased deposits and repayment of short-term borrowings during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $1.3 billion   and $  405 million  , respectively, of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank and was earning interest at the Federal Funds target rate, and interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions were $  724 million   and $  500 million  , respectively. 
   
  Investment Securities 
  Investment securities totaled   $21.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $4.7 billion, or   18.4 percent  , compared to   $25.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Our investment securities portfolio consists of: (i) an available-for-sale securities portfolio and a held-to-maturity securities portfolio, both of which represent interest-earning investment securities; and (ii) a non-marketable and other securities portfolio, which primarily represents investments managed as part of our funds management business.  
  Available-for-Sale Securities 
  Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is primarily a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Period-end available-for-sale securities were   $12.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $16.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of   $3.7 billion  , or   22.7 percent  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to support loan growth and the liquidity needs of the Bank, we sold approximately $2.9 billion of U.S. Treasury securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. Additionally, the portfolio decreased due to principal paydowns and maturities of $1.0 billion. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio of $158 million as a result of a decrease in market interest rates at period-end as compared to rates at December 31, 2015. The $158 million increase in fair value was reflected as a $93 million (net of tax) increase in accumulated other comprehensive income.  
  Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair market value with changes in fair market value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in a separate component of stockholders' equity.  
  Held-to-Maturity Securities 
  Period-end held-to-maturity securities were   $7.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of   $1.0 billion  , or   11.4 percent  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the portfolio decreased due to principal paydowns and maturities of $1.2 billion, partially offset by purchases of $226 million primarily in agency-backed mortgage securities and debentures. 
  Securities classified as held-to-maturity are accounted for at cost with no adjustments for changes in fair value.  For securities previously re-designated as held-to-maturity from available-for-sale, the net unrealized gains at the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity and amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount. 
  Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates. The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also impacted by changes  
  
   80 

     Table of Contents  

in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. Our estimated fixed income securities portfolio duration was   2.3   years and   2.7   years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Non-Marketable and Other Securities 
  Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, our China Joint Venture, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. Included in our non-marketable and other securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of these investments that we are deemed to control, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. See below for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG. 
  Period-end non-marketable and other securities were   $625.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $674.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of $49.7 million, or   7.4 percent  . Non-marketable and other securities, net of noncontrolling interests were   $503.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $548.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net $49.7 million decrease was due primarily to sales of investments included in our qualified affordable housing projects portfolio totaling $44.8 million. The following table summarizes the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG (which generally represents the carrying value times our ownership percentage) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    Investments classified as other securities (fair value accounting) represent direct equity investments in public companies held by our consolidated funds.  

Volcker Rule 
  As discussed in "Business - Supervision and Regulation" under Item 1 of Part I of our 2015 Form 10-K, the  Volcker Rule  under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts, among other things, a bank's proprietary trading activities and a bank's ability to sponsor or invest in certain privately offered funds, including certain venture capital, hedge and private equity funds. On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and the CFTC adopted final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule. The final regulations became effective on April 1, 2014, subject to a conformance timeline pursuant to which affected entities (referred to as "banking entities") are required to bring their activities and investments into conformance with the prohibitions and restrictions of the Volcker Rule and the final regulations thereunder. 
  Subject to certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in  proprietary trading,  which is defined as engaging in purchases or sales of securities or certain other financial instruments, as principal, for the  trading account  of the banking entity. Certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as  permitted activities,  and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading, such as market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging activities, trading in U.S. government or agency obligations, or certain other U.S. state or municipal obligations, and the obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. The compliance date for the proprietary trading prohibition was July 1, 2015. Based on the definition described above and the exceptions provided under the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, we believe that compliance with the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading prohibition is unlikely to have a material effect on our business or operations. 
  Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the rule prohibits a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in  covered funds,  which includes many venture capital, private equity and hedge funds. One of the available exceptions permits a banking entity to sponsor and invest in a covered fund that it organizes and offers to customers, provided that additional requirements are met. These permitted investments generally are limited to three percent of the total ownership interests in each covered fund. In addition, the aggregate investments a banking entity makes in all covered funds generally are limited to three percent of the institution s Tier 1 capital. 
  Under the final regulations, the Volcker Rule s prohibitions and restrictions apply to SVB Financial, the Bank and any affiliate of SVB Financial or the Bank. SVB Financial currently maintains investments in certain venture capital and private equity funds that it did not sponsor; maintains investments in sponsored funds that exceed three percent of each such fund s total ownership interests; and maintains aggregate investments in all covered funds that may exceed three percent of its Tier 1 capital. SVB Financial (including its affiliates) expects, therefore, that it will be required to reduce the level of its investments in covered funds over time and to forego investment opportunities in certain funds in the future. SVB Financial is generally required by the final rules to come into conformance with the Volcker Rule s requirements regarding covered funds by July 2017 with respect to covered funds in which SVB Financial invested or SVB Financial sponsored as of December 31, 2013. In addition, the Federal Reserve may extend the conformance deadline for up to an additional five years (until July 2022) for investments that are  
  
   82 

     Table of Contents  

considered illiquid. We intend to seek the maximum extensions (up to July 2022) available to us. However, there is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve Board will grant any further extensions and in order to be compliant with the Volcker Rule, SVB Financial may be required to reduce some or all of its investments in covered funds by July 2017. At least some of SVB Financial's investments in covered funds likely will reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance with the Volcker Rule is required. However, a forced sale or restructuring of SVB Financial's investments in covered funds due to the Volcker Rule would likely result in SVB Financial receiving less than the carrying value of such investments (or other adverse consequences), as there could be a limited secondary market for these investments and SVB Financial may be unable to sell them in orderly transactions. 
  We estimate that our total venture capital and private equity fund investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund interests and therefore subject to the Volcker Rule s restrictions, had, as of   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate carrying value of approximately $204 million (and an aggregate fair value of $306 million). These covered fund interests are comprised of interests attributable, solely, to the Company in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non-marketable securities.  
  We continue to assess the financial impact of these rules on our fund investments, as well as the impact of other Volcker Rule restrictions on other areas of our business. (See  Risk Factors  under Item 1A of Part I of our 2015 Form 10-K.) 

Loans 
  Loans, net of unearned income increased by $2.4 billion to   $19.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $16.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Unearned income was   $117 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $115 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Total gross loans were   $19.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of $2.3 billion, compared to   $16.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Period-end loans increased compared to December 31, 2015, primarily driven by the increases in our private equity/venture capital and SVB Private Bank portfolios. The breakdown of total gross loans and total loans as a percentage of total gross loans by category is as follows:

Loan Concentration 
  The following table provides a summary of loans by size and category. The breakout of the categories is based on total client balances (individually or in the aggregate) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

At   September 30, 2016  , gross loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled   $8.5 billion  , or   44 percent   of our portfolio. These loans represented   223   clients, and of these loans,   $77.4 million   were on nonaccrual status as of   September 30, 2016   compared to $85.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The $7.8 million decrease in nonaccrual loans greater than $20 million to any single client was primarily attributable to the repayment of a sponsored buyout loan as a result of an acquisition, partially offset by a new nonaccrual sponsored buyout loan in our life science/healthcare loan portfolio. 
  The following table provides a summary of loans by size and category. The breakout of the categories is based on total client balances (individually or in the aggregate) as of   December 31, 2015  :

     Table of Contents  

At   December 31, 2015  , gross loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled   $6.8 billion  , or   41 percent   of our portfolio. These loans represented   188   clients, and of these loans,   $85.2 million   were on nonaccrual status as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  The credit profile of our loan portfolio clients varies based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments.  Our three main market segments include (i) technology (software and internet, and hardware) and life science/healthcare, (ii) private equity/venture capital, and (iii) SVB Private Bank.  
  (i) Technology and Life Science/Healthcare 
   Our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios include loans to clients at all stages of their life cycles and represent the largest segments of our loan portfolio. The primary underwriting method for our technology and life science/healthcare portfolios are classified as investor dependent, balance sheet dependent, or cash flow dependent.  
    
  Investor dependent loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at 10 percent of total gross loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 12 percent at December 31, 2015. These loans are made to companies in both our early-stage and Growth stage segments. Investor dependent loans typically have modest or negative cash flows and no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capital firms or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party or an IPO. Venture capital firms may provide financing selectively, at reduced amounts, or on less favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers' ability to repay their loans to us. When repayment is dependent upon the next round of venture investment and there is an indication that further investment is unlikely or will not occur, it is often likely that the company would need to be sold to repay debt in full. If reasonable efforts have not yielded a likely buyer willing to repay all debt at the close of the sale or on commercially viable terms, the account will most likely be deemed to be impaired.  
    
  Balance sheet dependent loans, which includes asset-based loans, represented 13 percent of total gross loans at   September 30, 2016   compared to 14 percent at December 31, 2015. Balance sheet dependent loans are structured to require constant current asset coverage (i.e. cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and, to a much lesser extent, inventory) in an amount that exceeds the outstanding debt. These loans are generally made to companies in our Growth and Corporate Finance practices. Our asset-based lending, which includes working capital lines and accounts receivable factoring, represented seven percent and two percent of total gross loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The repayment of these arrangements is dependent on the financial condition, and payment ability, of third parties with whom our clients do business. 
    
  Cash flow dependent loans, which include sponsored buyout lending, represent our largest source of repayment within our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios at approximately 20 percent of total gross loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 23 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2015. Cash flow dependent loans require the borrower to maintain cash flow from operations that is sufficient to service all debt. Borrowers must demonstrate normalized cash flow in excess of all fixed charges associated with operating the business. Sponsored buyout loans represented 11 percent of total gross loans at September 30, 2016, compared to 13 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2015. These loans are typically used to assist a select group of experienced private equity sponsors with the acquisition of businesses, are larger in size, and repayment is generally dependent upon the cash flows of the acquired company. The acquired companies are typically established, later-stage businesses of scale and characterized by reasonable levels of leverage and loan structures that include meaningful financial covenants. The sponsor's equity contribution is often 50 percent or more of the acquisition price. 
    
  (ii) Private Equity/Venture Capital 
  We also provide financial services to clients in the private equity/venture capital community. At   September 30, 2016  , our lending to private equity/venture capital firms and funds represented 39 percent of total gross loans, compared to 33 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2015. The vast majority of this portfolio consists of capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These facilities are generally governed by meaningful financial covenants oriented towards ensuring that the funds' remaining callable capital is sufficient to repay the loan, and larger commitments (typically provided to larger private equity funds) are often secured by an assignment of the general partner's right to call capital from the fund's limited partner investors.

     Table of Contents  

(iii) SVB Private Bank 
  Our SVB Private Bank clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. Our lending to SVB Private Bank clients represented 11 percent of total gross loans at both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. Many of these clients have mortgages, which represented 84 percent of this portfolio at   September 30, 2016  ; the balance of this portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit, and other secured and unsecured lending. 
    
  State Concentrations 
  Approximately 32 percent and 10 percent of our outstanding total gross loan balances as of   September 30, 2016   were to borrowers based in California and New York, respectively, compared to 34 percent and 12 percent as of December 31, 2015. Other than California and New York, there are no states with gross loan balances greater than 10 percent. 
    
  See generally  Risk Factors Credit Risks  set forth under Item 1A, Part I in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Credit Quality Indicators 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our total criticized loans and impaired loans represented   six percent   of our total gross loans. Criticized and impaired loans to early-stage clients represented 14 percent and 18 percent of our total criticized and impaired loan balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Loans to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at   six percent   of total gross loans. It is common for early-stage client s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. Based on our experience, for most early-stage clients, this situation typically lasts one to two quarters and generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding, though there are exceptions, from time to time. As a result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will reside in our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle. 
  Credit Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses 
  Nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest, and Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") and other foreclosed assets. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses: 
  
   86 

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    The  Reserve for unfunded credit commitments  is included as a component of other liabilities. See  Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments  above for a discussion of the changes to the reserve. 
              (2) 
    Includes unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. 
     Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans decreased four basis points to   1.25   percent at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease of four basis points was reflective primarily of the decrease in our allowance for nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total gross loans by eight basis points, to 0.23 percent, at September 30, 2016, offset by an increase in our allowance for loan losses for performing loans as a percentage of total gross loans by four basis points, to   1.02 percent  , at   September 30, 2016   driven by a shift in the mix of our performing loan portfolio. 
  Our allowance for loan losses for nonaccrual loans was   $44.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $51.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The $7.5 million decrease in the allowance for nonaccrual loans reflected a $28.7 million reserve reduction as a result of charge-offs and a $12.4 million reserve reduction due to the repayment and improved credit of two of our sponsored buyout loans. The decrease was partially offset by $35.8 million of reserves on new nonaccrual loans. 
  Our nonperforming loans were   $106.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $123.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Our nonperforming loan balance decreased $17.1 million as a result of $57.1 million in repayments and $31.3 million in charge-offs, partially offset by $72.4 million in new nonaccrual loans. New nonaccrual loans of $72.4 million included $22.9 million from a sponsored buyout client in our life science/healthcare loan portfolio and $23.9 million from early-stage clients in our software and internet loan portfolio.  
  Nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016  , included $77.4 million from three clients (two life science/healthcare clients represented $45.9 million and one software and internet client represented $31.5 million). Nonaccrual loans at   December 31, 2015   included $96.0 million from five clients (three software and internet clients represented $55.1 million and two life science/healthcare clients represented $40.9 million). None of these loans were from early-stage clients.

Average impaired loans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were $169.4 million and $165.1 million compared to $101.6 million and $68.0 million for the comparable   2015   periods. The $67.8 million increase in average impaired loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   September 30, 2015   was primarily from our hardware and life science/healthcare loan portfolios. The $97.1 million increase in average impaired loans during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   September 30, 2015   was from our life science/healthcare, hardware and software and internet loan portfolios. If the impaired loans had not been impaired, $1.1 million and $3.8 million in interest income would have been recorded for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to $1.1 million and $2.5 million for the comparable   2015   periods. 
   
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets

    See  Derivatives  section below. 
       
  Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Assets 
  Foreign exchange spot contract assets represent unsettled client trades at the end of the period. The decrease of   $38.3 million   was due primarily to an overall decrease in activity at period-end. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  The increase of $46.4 million in accounts receivable was due primarily to a receivable of $25.0 million from sales of investments in our qualified affordable housing projects portfolio. 
  Net Deferred Tax Assets  
  The decrease of   $49.3 million   in net deferred tax assets primarily related to an increase in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio due to the decrease in market interest rates at period-end.

  Equity Warrant Assets 
  In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. At   September 30, 2016  , we held warrants in   1,719   companies, compared to   1,652   companies at   December 31, 2015  . Warrants in 18 companies each had values greater than $1.0 million and collectively represented 36 percent of the fair value of the total warrant portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded in gains on derivatives instruments, net, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. The following table provides a summary of transactions and valuation changes for equity warrant assets for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

Foreign Exchange Forward and Foreign Currency Option Contracts 
  We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in foreign activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients  need. For each forward or option contract entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in currency rates. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated instruments. Net gains and losses on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded in the line item  Other  as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We have not experienced nonperformance by any of our counterparties and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts at   September 30, 2016   was   $7.1 million   and our net exposure at   December 31, 2015   was   $3.0 million  . For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see Note 9-  Derivative Financial Instruments  of the  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  under Part I, Item I in this report.

Deposits 
  Deposits were $  38.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $0.9 billion, or   2.4 percent  , compared to $  39.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in deposits was due primarily to increased utilization of higher yielding off-balance sheet client investment funds by our early-stage clients.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate balance of time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $250,000 totaled $38.1 million, compared to $53.9 million at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , $38.1 million of the time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $250,000 were scheduled to mature within one year. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business. 
   
  Short-Term Borrowings 
  We had   $2.4 million   in short-term borrowings at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $774.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was due to the repayment of short-term borrowings utilized and outstanding at December 31, 2015.  
  Long-Term Debt 
  Our long-term debt was   $796.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $796.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , long-term debt included our 3.50% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes, 6.05% Subordinated Notes and 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 8  Short-term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt  of the  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  under Part I, Item I in this report. 
   
  Other Liabilities 
  A summary of other liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

(1)   
    See  Derivatives  section above. 
     Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities 
  Foreign exchange spot contract liabilities represent unsettled client trades at the end of the period. The decrease of   $36.5 million   was due primarily to decreased client trade activity at period-end. 
  Accrued Compensation 
  Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP/profit sharing and other compensation arrangements. The decrease of   $48.7 million   was primarily the result of 2015 incentive compensation payouts during the first quarter of 2016 as well as lower accruals for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   based on current expectations for our updated internal performance estimates for 2016. 
   
  Noncontrolling Interests 
  Noncontrolling interests totaled   $130.3 million   and $  135.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The $4.8 million decrease was due primarily to net distributions of   $8.2 million   to limited partners from various managed funds of funds, partially offset by income attributable to noncontrolling interests of   $3.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Fair Value Measurements 
  
   90 

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .    

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our non-marketable investment securities in shares of private company stock and equity warrant assets (rights to shares of private and public company capital stock). The valuation methodologies of our non-marketable securities carried under fair value accounting and equity warrant assets involve a significant degree of management judgment. Refer to Note 14  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  of the  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  under Part I, Item 1 of this report for a summary of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used for each class of Level 3 assets.  
  The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell, and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses (See  Risk Factors  set forth in our   2015   Form 10-K).  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of   $21.1 million   and   $33.1 million  , primarily due to valuation increases from our public and private company warrant portfolios and net gains realized on exercised warrant assets due to IPO and M A activity. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of   $11.6 million   and   $55.0 million  . 
   
  Capital Resources 
  We maintain an adequate capital base to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs and credit and other business risks, and to provide for SVB Financial and the Bank to be in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of our capital stock or other securities. In consultation with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, management engages in regular capital planning processes designed to effectively utilize capital resources available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments. In addition, we conduct capital stress tests as part of our annual capital planning process. The stress tests allow us to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on our capital adequacy position. 
  SVBFG Stockholders  Equity 
  SVBFG stockholders  equity totaled $  3.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.4 billion  , or   12.3 percent  , compared to   $3.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . This increase was due primarily to net income of   $283 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase in the net balance of our accumulated other comprehensive income to $97 million from $15 million at   December 31, 2015  , and an increase in additional paid-in capital of $31 million attributable primarily to amortization of share-based compensation. The increase in our accumulated other comprehensive income was driven primarily by a $158 million increase in the fair value of our AFS securities portfolio ($93 million net of tax), which resulted from a decrease in period-end market interest rates at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to market interest rates at   December 31, 2015  .

Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future. 
  Capital Ratios 
  Both SVB Financial and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies.  
  Regulatory capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank exceeded minimum federal regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized depository institution as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank, compared to the minimum regulatory ratios applicable to bank holding companies and banks to be considered  well capitalized  and  adequately capitalized , are set forth below: 

(1) 
    See below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets. 
       
  Both SVB Financial s and the Bank's risk-based capital ratios (CET 1, tier 1 and total risk-based capital) increased as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2015. The increases were a result of the proportionally higher increase in our capital compared to the increases in risk-weighted assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increased capital was reflective primarily of year-to-date earnings. The growth in period-end risk-weighted assets was primarily from loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in fixed income securities.     SVB Financial's and the Bank's tier 1 leverage ratios increased 72 basis points and 65 basis points, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. The higher tier 1 leverage ratios were reflective of the increase in tier 1 capital from net income and the decrease in average assets resulting from the decrease in both cash and fixed income investment securities, partially offset by loan growth. All of our reported capital ratios remain above the levels considered to be  well capitalized  under applicable banking regulations. 
  The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios are not required by GAAP or applicable bank regulatory requirements. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these ratios in evaluating the adequacy of the Company s capital levels; however, these financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These ratios are calculated by dividing total SVBFG stockholders' equity, by total period-end assets and risk-weighted assets, after reducing both amounts by acquired intangibles, if any. The manner in which this ratio is calculated varies among companies. Accordingly, our ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar measures of other companies.

The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP for SVB Financial and the Bank for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Both the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio increased for SVB Financial and the Bank. The increases are a result of the proportionally higher increase in our capital compared to the changes in total and risk-weighted assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increased capital is reflective primarily of 2016 year-to-date earnings. Total assets decreased as a result of the sale of $2.9 billion of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by loan growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The growth in period-end risk-weighted assets was primarily from loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in fixed income securities.     See "SVBFG Stockholders  Equity" above for further details on changes to the individual components of our equity balance. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit and commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity fund investments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. For details of our commitments to extend credit, and commercial and standby letters of credit, please refer to Note 12  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments  of the  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
  Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds 
  Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule, we make investments. We make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a   10  -year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling   100%   of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over   5   to   7   years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call 100% of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. 
  For further details on our commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, refer to Note 12  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments  of the  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
  Liquidity 
  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors  needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions. 
  We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices. 
  
   93

Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. We may also offer more investment alternatives off the balance sheet which may impact deposit levels. At   September 30, 2016  , our period-end total deposit balances were   $38.2 billion  , compared to   $39.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, available-for-sale securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments. 
  On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, cash proceeds from the sale of equity warrants and fund investments and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in  Business Supervision and Regulation Restriction on Dividends  under Part I, Item 1 of our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Consolidated Summary of Cash Flows 
  Below is a summary of our average cash position and statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . For further details, see our "Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited)" under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Average cash and cash equivalents increased by   $49 million  , or   2.1 percent  , to   $2.4 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.4 billion   for the comparable   2015   period.  
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $273.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , reflective primarily of net income before noncontrolling interests of   $286.6 million  , partially offset by a $48.7 million reduction of compensation accruals during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from the incentive compensation payouts during the first quarter of 2016, offset by incentive compensation accruals for 2016. 
  Cash provided by investing activities of   $2.5 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was driven by $2.9 billion in proceeds from the sale of U.S. Treasury securities and $2.2 billion from maturities and principal paydowns from our fixed income securities investment portfolio, partially offset by $2.4 billion in loan growth. 
  Cash used for financing activities was   $1.7 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily reflective of a net decrease of $1.0 billion in deposits and $0.8 billion of payments on our overnight short-term borrowings. 
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $2.5 billion   and $1.7 billion, respectively, at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse fluctuations in the market value of financial instruments due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, widening or tightening of credit spreads, changes in the general level of market interest rates and changes in the shape and level of the benchmark LIBOR/SWAP yield curve. Additionally, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on mortgage securities which affects the rate of amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant compared to interest rate sensitivity risks and no separate quantitative information concerning them is presented herein. 
  Interest rate risk is managed by our ALCO. ALCO reviews the market valuation and 12-month forward looking earnings sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, structural changes in investment and funding portfolios, loan and deposit activity and current market conditions. Adherence to relevant policies, which are approved by the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
  Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving our fixed income securities portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, our policies permit the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 
  We utilize a simulation model to perform sensitivity analysis on the economic value of equity and net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios, balance sheet forecasts and proposed strategies. The simulation model provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity embedded in our balance sheet which measures the potential variability in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time. We review our interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis at a minimum.       
  Model Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis 
  One application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity ( EVE ). EVE is defined as the market value of assets, less the market value of liabilities, adjusted for any off-balance sheet items. A second application of the simulation model measures the impact of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income ( NII ) assuming a static balance sheet as of the period-end reporting date. Changes in market interest rates that affect us are principally short-term interest rates and include the following: (i) National Prime and SVB Prime rates; (ii) 1-month and 3-month LIBOR; and (iii) Federal Funds target rate. Changes in these short-term rates impact interest earned on our variable rate loans, variable rate investment securities and balances held as cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, deposit pricing generally follows overall changes in short-term interest rates. 
  For the period ended September 30, 2016, an assumption change was applied to the EVE simulation model for the discount spreads applied to our loan balances. Prior to this change, discount spread assumptions were derived utilizing the historical data of new loans that had originated in the previous month. The new methodology derives loan discount spread assumptions utilizing a historical rolling six-month average of new loan originations. The assumption change produced a lower overall discount spread on our loan balances at September 30, 2016, ultimately resulting in a higher base case EVE of $303 million and a lower base case estimated NII of $4 million, as compared to the respective base cases as derived under the old methodology. We believe the new methodology produces a discount spread assumption that is more stable from period to period and better represents the overall market for our loan balances.    
  This assumption change did not have a significant impact on NII sensitivity results, nor did it substantially change the EVE sensitivity profile. The impact of this modeling change was primarily to the overall level of EVE. 
  
   95 

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents our EVE and NII sensitivity exposure related to an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points at September 30, 2016, presented under both the new and old methodologies for comparative purposes, and at December, 31, 2015, as previously reported: 

Economic Value of Equity 
  The estimated EVE in the preceding table is based on a combination of valuation methodologies including a discounted cash flow analysis and a multi-path lattice based valuation. Both methodologies use publicly available market interest rates. The model simulations and calculations are highly assumption-dependent and will change regularly as our asset/liability structure changes, as interest rate environments evolve, and as we change our assumptions in response to relevant market or business circumstances. These calculations do not reflect the changes that we anticipate or may make to reduce our EVE exposure in response to a change in market interest rates as a part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy. 
  As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table. We are exposed to yield curve risk, prepayment risk and basis risk, which cannot be fully modeled and expressed using the above methodology. Accordingly, the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as a precise indicator of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally, the resulting EVE and NII estimates are not intended to represent, and should not be construed to represent the underlying value. In addition, we assume different deposit balance decay rates for each interest rate scenario based on a historical deposit study of our clients. 
  Our base case EVE as of September 30, 2016 increased from December 31, 2015 by $8 million as a result of balance sheet mix changes, as well as yield curve changes. At September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, total loan balances increased $2.4 billion, while total investment securities decreased $4.7 billion, primarily due to sales of AFS securities and fixed income portfolio maturities. Additionally, total deposit decreases of $953 million were offset by cash and cash equivalent balance increases of $1.0 billion. 
  Marginally higher LIBOR rates in the 3- to 12-month term points continue to drive a relatively flat yield curve compared to December 31, 2015. Higher rates contributed to a $240 million decrease in EVE sensitivity in the +100 bps rate shock scenario while higher rates in the -100 and -200 bps rate shock scenarios contributed to increases of $471 million and $270 million, respectively. Changes in all three of these scenarios are can be attributed to the increase in the yield curve described above, which causes the discount curves for loans and deposits to hit fewer floors as compared to the curve as of December 31, 2015.  
  
   96 

     Table of Contents  

This allows more of the impact from a downward rate shock to flow through the valuation. The balance sheet changes described previously were not a significant factor in the change in sensitivity relative to December 31, 2015 results. 
  12-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 
  Our estimated 12-month base case NII forecast at September 30, 2016 decreased from December 31, 2015 by $5 million  ,   primarily due to the change in balance sheet composition as noted above. Higher-yielding investment portfolio instruments are being replaced by lower-yielding floating rate loans, however, the decrease in asset yield is being mitigated to some extent by a decrease in interest expense due to balance sheet runoff in interest bearing deposits.   
  NII sensitivity at September 30, 2016 in the +100 and +200 bps interest rate shock scenarios increased $52 million and $99 million, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2015. These changes are due primarily to the changing composition of the balance sheet as noted above.  Specifically, an increase in floating rate loans coupled with lower interest bearing deposit balances causes NII to increase in a rising rate environment. 
  The simulation model used in the above analysis embeds floors in our interest rate scenarios, which prevent model benchmark rates from moving below 0.0%. In addition, we assume different deposit balance decay rates for each interest rate scenario based on a historical deposit study of our clients. These assumptions may change in future periods based on management discretion. Actual changes in our deposit pricing strategies may differ from our current model assumptions and may have an impact on our overall sensitivity. 
   
  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
