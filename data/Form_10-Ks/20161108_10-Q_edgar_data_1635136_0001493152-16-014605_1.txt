Note
2 - Basis of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures necessary for a comprehensive
presentation of consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management s opinion, however,
that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair consolidated
financial statements presentation.  

The
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report, which
contains the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Management s Discussion and
Analysis, for the year ended March 31, 2016. The interim results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of results for the full fiscal year.  

Note
3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Consolidation    

Duo
World Inc. is the parent company of its 100% subsidiaries Duo Software (Pvt.) Limited (DSSL) and Duo Software Pte Limited (DSS).
Duo Software Pte Limited is the parent company of its 100% subsidiary Duo Software India (Private) Limited (India). All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is least reasonably possible that the estimate
of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management
considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future non-confirming events. Accordingly,
the actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the timing and amounts of revenue
recognition, the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities and the collectability of accounts receivable.

Risks
and Uncertainties    

The
Company s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, competition and
potential risk of business failure. Product revenues are concentrated in the application software industry, which is highly competitive
and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive
products with new capabilities or technologies could adversely affect operating results  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk    

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various high quality financial
institutions and we monitor the credit ratings of those institutions. The Company s sales are primarily to the companies
located in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia and India. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and the
risk with respect to trade receivables is further mitigated by the diversity, both by geography and by industry, of the customer
base. Accounts receivable are due principally from the companies understated contract terms.  

Provisions    

A
provision is recognized when the company has present obligations as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimate can be made of amount of
the obligation. Provisions are not discounted at their present value and are determined based on the best estimate required to
settle the obligation at the reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current
best estimates.  

Accounts
Receivable and Provision for Doubtful Accounts    

The
Company recognizes accounts receivable in connection with the products sold and services provided and have strong policies and
procedures for the collection receivables from its clients. However, there are inevitably occasions when the receivables due to
the company, cannot be collected and therefore has to be written off as bad debts. While the debt collection process is being
pursued, an assessment is made of the likelihood of the receivable being collectable. A provision is therefore made against the
outstanding receivable to reflect that component that may not become collectable. The company is in the practice of provisioning
for doubtful debts based on the period outstanding as per the following:  

Cash
Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of
September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, there were no cash equivalents.

Foreign
Currency Translation    

The
functional currencies of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. For financial reporting purposes,
these currencies have been translated into United States Dollars ($) and/or USD as the reporting currency. All assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet
date and equity balances are translated at historical rates. Revenues, costs and expenses in foreign functional currencies are
translated at the average rate of exchange during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange
rates from period to period are included as a component of shareholders  deficit as  accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) . Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statement of operations
and comprehensive income / (loss) as other income (expense).  

Fixed
assets    

Fixed
assets (including leasehold improvements) are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated salvage value
is considered as NIL. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated
benefit period of the related assets, which may not exceed 15 years, or the lease term, if shorter. Repairs and maintenance expenditures,
which are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred.
In case of sale or disposal of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated financial
statements.  

Useful
lives of the fixed assets are as follows:  

Furniture
      Fittings  
      5
    years   
 
      Improvements
    to lease hold assets  
      Lease
    term   
 
      Office
    equipment

    equipment (Data Processing Equipment)  
      3
    years   
 
      Website
    development  
      4
    years   

For
the financial year ending March 31, 2016, the useful life of Computer Equipment and Website development were assumed to be 5 years.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

The
Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured
by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale would be separately
presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs related to the sale,
and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a group classified as held for sale would be presented separately
in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.  

Fair
Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance
on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability,
as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value maybe based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature
of these instruments.

Revenue
Recognition, Deferred  Accrued Revenue    

The
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses and related services in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
ASC Topic 605 sets forth guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned, which is generally, when all of the
following criteria are met:  

Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or purchase order signed by
    the customer.   

Delivery
    has occurred or services have been performed. Services are considered delivered as the work is performed or, in the case of
    maintenance, over the contractual service period. The Company uses written evidence of customer acceptance to verify delivery
    or completion of any performance terms.   

The
    seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable. The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable
    based on payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.   

Collectability
    is reasonably assured. The Company assesses collectability primarily based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined
    by credit checks and related analysis, as well as the Customer s payment history, economic conditions in the customer s
    industry and geographic location and general economic conditions. If we do not consider collection of a fee to be probable,
    we defer the revenue until the fees are collected, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.   

The
Company typically licenses its products on a per server, per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection
of the products licensed, the number of site installations and the number of authorized users. Currently, Duo is offering two
major products from which it generates its revenue they are  Duo Contact     Duo Subscribe . In the
case of  Duo Contact , Duo offers license to use software to its clients under an agreement. Invoices are raised monthly
over the term of agreement, and it recognizes revenue monthly over the term of the underlying arrangement. In the case of  Duo
Subscribe , Duo sells its software license along with software implementation and annual maintenance services under an agreement
with various clients. The Company raises invoice on key milestone basis as defined in the agreement. Revenue recognition is based
on stage of completion basis. Revenues from consulting and training services are typically recognized as the services are performed.  

The
Company offers annual maintenance programs on its licenses that provide for technical support and updates to the Company s
software products. Maintenance fees are bundled with license fees in the initial licensing period and charged separately for renewals
of annual maintenance in subsequent years. Fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts
or separate sales of renewals to customers. Revenue is recognized ratably, or daily, over the term of the maintenance period,
which is typically one year.  

For
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company received only cash as consideration for sale of licenses and related
services rendered.  

For
the six months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company had following concentrations of revenue with customers:

Deferred
Revenue -   Deferred revenue represents advance payments for software licenses, services, and maintenance billed in advance
of the time revenue is recognized. As at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, deferred revenue was $5,762 and $9,954 respectively.  

Accrued
Revenue/Unbilled Accounts Receivable -   Accrued revenue/Unbilled accounts receivable primarily occur due to the timing
of the respective billings, which occur subsequent to the end of each reporting period. As at September 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016, unbilled/accrued revenues were $738 and $31,154 respectively.  

Cost
of Revenue    

Cost
of revenue mainly includes purchases, product implementation costs, amortization of product development, Developer support and
implementation, and consultancy fees related to the products offered by Duo. The aggregate cost related to the software implementations
including support and consulting services pertaining to the revenue recognized during the reporting period, is recognized as Cost
of Revenue.  

Product
research and development    

Product
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for the Company s development and technical support
staff, contractors  fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services and development
of new products and services. Costs incurred for software development prior to technological feasibility are expensed as product
research and development costs in the period incurred. Once the point of technological feasibility is reached, which is generally
the completion of a working prototype that has no critical bugs and is a release candidate; development costs are capitalized
until the product is ready for general release and are classified within  Intangibles assets  in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes capitalized software development costs using the greater of the ratio of the
products  current gross revenues to the total of current gross revenues and expected gross revenues or on a straight-line
basis over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically four years.  

During
the quarters ending on September 30, 2016 and 2015, product research and development cost of $105,803 and $65,600, respectively,
was capitalized as  Intangible assets .  

Advertising
Costs    

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. No advertising expenses were incurred during the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

Comprehensive
Income    

The
Comprehensive Income Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes standards for reporting and presentation
of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income from April 1, 2013 through
September 30, 2016, includes only foreign currency translation gains (losses), and is presented in the Company s consolidated
statements of comprehensive income.

A.       Business
                                         overview:      

Duo
World Inc. (hereinafter referred to as  Successor  or  Duo ) a private company, was organized under the
laws of the state of Nevada on September 19, 2014. Duo Software (Pvt.) Limited (hereinafter referred to as  DSSL 
or  Predecessor ), a Sri Lanka based company, was incorporated on September 22, 2004, in the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka, as a limited liability company. Duo Software (Pte.) Limited (hereinafter referred to as  DSS 
or  Predecessor ), a Singapore based company, was incorporated on June 5, 2007 in the Republic of Singapore as a limited
liability company. DSS also includes its wholly-owned subsidiary, Duo Software India (Private) Limited (India) which was incorporated
on August 30, 2007, under the laws of India.  

Effective
December 3, 2014, DSSL and DSS executed a reverse recapitalization with Duo. Duo (Successor) is a holding company that conducts
operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries DSSL and DSS (Predecessors) in Sri Lanka, Singapore and India. The consolidated
entity is referred to as  the Company . The Company, having its development center in Colombo, Sri Lanka, has been
in the business of developing products and services for the subscription based industry. The Company s applications ( DuoSubscribe 
   DuoCLM ) run on its core platform  Duo World  and is a provider of solutions for its customers
for Customer Life Cycle Management, Subscriber Management, Customer Care, Billing and Contact Center Management.  

Our
authorized capital consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, of which 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
$0.001 par value.  

B.       Critical
                                         Accounting Policies:      

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses
and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the
extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are
critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving
management s judgments and estimates.  

Critical
accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need
to make estimates about the effect of the matters that are inherently uncertain.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue from the sales of software licenses and related services in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue
Recognition. ASC Topic 605 sets forth guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned, which is generally when
all of the following criteria are met:  

Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or purchase order signed by
    the customer.   

Delivery
    has occurred or services have been performed. Services are considered delivered as the work is performed or, in the case of
    maintenance, over the contractual service period. The Company uses written evidence of customer acceptance to verify delivery
    or completion of any performance terms.   

The
    seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable. The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable
    based on payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.   

Collectability
    is reasonably assured. The Company assesses collectability primarily based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined
    by credit checks and related analysis, as well as the Customer s payment history, economic conditions in the customer s
    industry and geographic location and general economic conditions. If we do not consider collection of a fee to be probable,
    we defer the revenue until the fees are collected, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.   

Duo
typically licenses its products on a per server, per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of
the products licensed, the number of site installations and the number of authorized users. Currently, Duo is offering two major
products from which it generates its revenue:  DuoCLM  and  DuoSubscribe.  In the case of  DuoCLM, 
Duo offers licenses to use software to its clients under an End-User License Agreement. Invoices are issued monthly over the term
of agreement. Then we recognize revenue monthly over the term of the underlying arrangement. In the case of  DuoSubscribe, 
Duo sells its software license along with software implementation and annual maintenance services under an agreement with various
clients. Duo invoices on key milestone basis as defined in the agreement. Then we recognize revenue on the basis of stage of completion.
Revenues from consulting and training services are typically recognized as the services are performed.  

Duo
offers annual maintenance programs on its licenses that provide for technical support and updates to Duo s software products.
Maintenance fees are bundled with license fees in the initial licensing period and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance
in subsequent years. Fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of
renewals to customers. Revenue is recognized ratably, or daily, over the term of the maintenance period, which is typically one
year.  

Provisions   

A
provision is recognized when the company has present obligations as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimate can be made of amount of
the obligation. Provisions are not discounted at their present value and are determined based on the best estimate required to
settle the obligation at the reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current
best estimates.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk   

We
are exposed to financial market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse
changes in market rates and prices.  

Foreign
Currency Exchange Risk   

Our
results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. All of our
revenues are normally generated in U.S. dollars or Sri Lankan rupees. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies
in which our operations are located, which are primarily in Asia and to a lesser extent in the U.S. Our results of operations
and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely
affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging
strategies. As our international operations grow, we plan to generate revenues in foreign currencies and we will continue to reassess
our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.  

Inflation   

We
do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last
three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset
such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 has decreased by 11% when compared to September 30, 2015. This small decrease

customers:

Cost
of sales as a percentage to revenue decreased from 28% in September 30, 2015 to 21% in September 30, 2016. Reduction in purchases

The
general and administrative expenditure has decreased by 21% in the six months ended September 30, 2016 when compared with six
