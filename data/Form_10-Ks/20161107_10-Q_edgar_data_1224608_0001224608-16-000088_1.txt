BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The following notes should be read together with the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  CNO Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CNO"), is a holding company for a group of insurance companies operating throughout the United States that develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products.  The terms "CNO Financial Group, Inc.", "CNO", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" as used in these financial statements refer to CNO and its subsidiaries.  Such terms, when used to describe insurance business and products, refer to the insurance business and products of CNO's insurance subsidiaries. 
    
  We focus on serving middle-income pre-retiree and retired Americans, which we believe are attractive, underserved, high growth markets.  We sell our products through   three   distribution channels: career agents, independent producers (some of whom sell one or more of our product lines exclusively) and direct marketing. 
    
  Our unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  As permitted by rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, we have condensed or omitted certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  We have reclassified certain amounts from the prior periods to conform to the 2016 presentation.  These reclassifications have no effect on net income or shareholders' equity.  Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. 
    
  The balance sheet at December 31, 2015, presented herein, has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
    
  When we prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that significantly affect reported amounts of various assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  For example, we use significant estimates and assumptions to calculate values for deferred acquisition costs, the present value of future profits, fair value measurements of certain investments (including derivatives), other-than-temporary impairments of investments, assets and liabilities related to income taxes, liabilities for insurance products, liabilities related to litigation and guaranty fund assessment accruals.  If our future experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, our financial statements would be materially affected. 
    
  The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Our consolidated financial statements exclude transactions between us and our consolidated affiliates, or among our consolidated affiliates. 

INVESTMENTS 
    
  We classify our   fixed maturity securities   into one of two categories: (i) "available for sale" (which we carry at estimated fair value with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax and related adjustments, recorded as a component of shareholders' equity); or (ii) "trading" (which we carry at estimated fair value with changes in such value recognized as net investment income (classified as investment income from policyholder and other special-purpose portfolios)). 
    
  Our     trading securities include:  (i) investments purchased with the intent of selling in the near term to generate income; (ii) investments supporting certain insurance liabilities (including investments backing the market strategies of our multibucket annuity products); and (iii) certain fixed maturity securities containing embedded derivatives for which we have elected the fair value option.  The change in fair value of the income generating investments and investments supporting insurance liabilities is recognized in income from policyholder and other special-purpose portfolios (a component of net investment income).  The change in fair value of securities with embedded derivatives is recognized in realized investment gains (losses). Investment income related to investments supporting certain insurance liabilities is substantially offset by the change in insurance policy benefits related to certain products.

Accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily comprised of the net effect of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments.  These amounts, included in shareholders' equity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (dollars in millions): 

________ 
           (a) 
    The present value of future profits is the value assigned to the right to receive future cash flows from contracts existing at September 10, 2003, the date Conseco, Inc., an Indiana corporation (our "Predecessor"), emerged from bankruptcy. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , adjustments to the present value of future profits, deferred acquisition costs, insurance liabilities and deferred tax assets included   $(99.8) million  ,   $(136.7) million  ,   $(414.0) million   and   $231.5 million  , respectively, for premium deficiencies that would exist on certain blocks of business (primarily long-term care products) if unrealized gains on the assets backing such products had been realized and the proceeds from the sales of such assets were invested at then current yields.

At   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, estimated fair value, other-than-temporary impairments in accumulated other comprehensive income of fixed maturities, available for sale, and equity securities were as follows (dollars in millions): 

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturities, available for sale, at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity.  Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties.  In addition, structured securities (such as asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, collectively referred to as "structured securities") frequently include provisions for periodic principal payments and permit periodic unscheduled payments.

Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) 
    
  The following table sets forth the net realized investment gains (losses) for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): 

_________________ 
           (a) 
    Changes in the estimated fair value of trading securities that we have elected the fair value option (and are still held as of the end of the respective periods) was   $.8 million   and   $(4.7) million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized net realized investment gains of   $23.3 million  , which were comprised of: (i)   $48.1 million   of net gains from the sales of investments; (ii) a   $7.3 million   loss on the dissolution of a variable interest entity ("VIE"); (iii) the increase in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of   $.6 million  ; (iv) the increase in fair value of embedded derivatives related to a modified coinsurance agreement of   $6.7 million  ; and (v)   $24.8 million   of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income.  
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized net realized investment losses of   $20.8 million  , which were comprised of: (i)   $1.5 million   of net losses from the sales of investments; (ii) an   $11.3 million   gain on the dissolution of a VIE; (iii) the decrease in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of   $4.7 million  ; (iv) the decrease in fair value of embedded derivatives related to a modified coinsurance agreement of   $4.3 million  ; and (v)   $21.6 million   of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income (  $24.6 million  , prior to the   $3.0 million   of impairment losses recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income). 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , VIEs that were required to be consolidated were dissolved.  We recognized a loss of   $7.3 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016   and a gain of   $11.3 million   during the first   nine   months of   2015  , representing the difference between the borrowings of such VIEs and the contractual distributions required following the liquidation of the underlying assets. 
    
  Our fixed maturity investments are generally purchased in the context of various long-term strategies, including funding insurance liabilities, so we do not generally seek to generate short-term realized gains through the purchase and sale of such securities.  In certain circumstances, including those in which securities are selling at prices which exceed our view of their underlying economic value, or when it is possible to reinvest the proceeds to better meet our long-term asset-liability objectives, we may sell certain securities.

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the   $84.4 million   of gross realized losses on sales of   $477.2 million   of fixed maturity securities, available for sale included: (i)   $77.8 million   related to various corporate securities (including   $62.7 million   related to sales of investments in the energy sector); (ii)   $5.3 million   related to commercial mortgage-backed securities; and (iii)   $1.3 million   related to various other investments.  Securities are generally sold at a loss following unforeseen issue-specific events or conditions or shifts in perceived risks.  These reasons include but are not limited to:  (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the market value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce our exposure to an asset class, an issuer or an industry; (iv) prospective or actual changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected portfolio cash flows. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized   $24.8 million   of impairment losses recorded in earnings which included: (i)   $6.3 million   of writedowns on fixed maturities of a single issuer in the energy sector; (ii)   $3.7 million   of writedowns on a direct loan due to borrower specific events; (iii)   $12.7 million   of writedowns on a privately placed preferred stock of an entity formed to construct and operate a chemical plant; (iv)   $.9 million   of writedowns related to a real estate investment; and (v)   $1.2 million   of writedowns of investments held by VIEs due to other-than-temporary declines in value.  Factors considered in determining the writedowns of investments in the first   nine   months of   2016   included the subordination status of each investment, the impact of recent downgrades and issuer specific events, including the impact of the current low oil prices on issuers in the energy sector. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized   $21.6 million   of impairment losses recorded in earnings which included:  (i)   $7.4 million   of writedowns on fixed maturities in the energy sector; (ii)   $3.6 million   of writedowns on commercial bank loans held by VIEs; (iii)   $2.7 million   of writedowns on other investments (primarily fixed maturities) due to issuer specific events; and (iv) a   $7.9 million   writedown of a legacy investment in a private company that was liquidated. 
    
  We regularly evaluate all of our investments with unrealized losses for possible impairment.  Our assessment of whether unrealized losses are "other than temporary" requires significant judgment.  Factors considered include:  (i) the extent to which fair value is less than the cost basis; (ii) the length of time that the fair value has been less than cost; (iii) whether the unrealized loss is event driven, credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates or risk premium; (iv) the near-term prospects for specific events, developments or circumstances likely to affect the value of the investment; (v) the investment's rating and whether the investment is investment-grade and/or has been downgraded since its purchase; (vi) whether the issuer is current on all payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the investment and is expected to meet all of its obligations under the terms of the investment; (vii) whether we intend to sell the investment or it is more likely than not that circumstances will require us to sell the investment before recovery occurs; (viii) the underlying current and prospective asset and enterprise values of the issuer and the extent to which the recoverability of the carrying value of our investment may be affected by changes in such values; (ix) projections of, and unfavorable changes in, cash flows on structured securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; (x) our best estimate of the value of any collateral; and (xi) other objective and subjective factors. 
    
  Future events may occur, or additional information may become available, which may necessitate future realized losses in our portfolio.  Significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 
    
  Impairment losses on equity securities are recognized in net income.  The manner in which impairment losses on fixed maturity securities, available for sale, are recognized in the financial statements is dependent on the facts and circumstances related to the specific security.  If we intend to sell a security or it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost, the security is other-than-temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is recognized as a loss through earnings.  If we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis, we do not plan to sell the security, and if it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost, less any current period credit loss, the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated.  We recognize the credit loss portion in net income and the noncredit loss portion in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  We estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a fixed maturity security impairment as the difference between amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security.  The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the

current yield to accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security.  The methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate of future cash flows vary depending on the type of security. 
    
  For most structured securities, cash flow estimates are based on bond specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity, prepayment speeds and structural support, including excess spread, subordination and guarantees.  For corporate bonds, cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using bond specific facts and circumstances.  The previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in net income becomes the security's new cost basis.  We accrete the new cost basis to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the security, except when the security is in default or considered nonperforming. 
    
  The remaining noncredit impairment, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, is the difference between the security's estimated fair value and our best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate prior to impairment.  The remaining noncredit impairment typically represents changes in the market interest rates, current market liquidity and risk premiums.  As of   September 30, 2016  , other-than-temporary impairments included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled   $4.5 million   (before taxes and related amortization). 
    
  The following table summarizes the amount of credit losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity securities, available for sale, held at the beginning of the period, for which a portion of the other-than-temporary impairment was also recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in millions):

  Gross Unrealized Investment Losses 
    
  Our investment strategy is to maximize, over a sustained period and within acceptable parameters of quality and risk, investment income and total investment return through active investment management.  Accordingly, we may sell securities at a gain or a loss to enhance the projected total return of the portfolio as market opportunities change, to reflect changing perceptions of risk, or to better match certain characteristics of our investment portfolio with the corresponding characteristics of our insurance liabilities.

The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses and fair values of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that such securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions):

Based on management's current assessment of investments with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes the issuers of the securities will continue to meet their obligations (or with respect to equity-type securities, the investment value will recover to its cost basis).  While we do not have the intent to sell securities with unrealized losses and it

is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities with unrealized losses prior to their anticipated recovery, our intent on an individual security may change, based upon market or other unforeseen developments.  In such instances, if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date due to these unexpected developments, the loss is recognized in the period in which we had the intent to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. 

EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  A reconciliation of net income and shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (dollars in millions and shares in thousands): 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Restricted shares (including our performance units) are not included in basic earnings per share until vested.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options were exercised and restricted stock was vested.  The dilution from options and restricted shares is calculated using the treasury stock method.  Under this method, we assume the proceeds from the exercise of the options (or the unrecognized compensation expense with respect to restricted stock and performance units) will be used to purchase shares of our common stock at the average market price during the period, reducing the dilutive effect of the exercise of the options (or the vesting of the restricted stock and performance units).

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  The Company manages its business through the following operating segments: Bankers Life, Washington National and Colonial Penn, which are defined on the basis of product distribution; and corporate operations, comprised of holding company activities and certain noninsurance company businesses.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we will begin reporting the long-term care block recaptured from Beechwood Re Ltd ("BRe") as an additional business segment.  
    
  We measure segment performance by excluding net realized investment gains (losses), fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities (net of related amortization), fair value changes and amendment in the agent deferred compensation plan, loss on reinsurance transaction, loss on extinguishment of debt, income taxes and other non-operating items consisting primarily of equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to VIEs ("pre-tax operating earnings") because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing business and trends in our business.  Our primary investment focus is on investment income to support our liabilities for insurance products as opposed to the generation of net realized investment gains (losses), and a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business. 
    
  The net realized investment gains (losses), fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities (net of related amortization), fair value changes and amendment in the agent deferred compensation plan, loss on reinsurance transaction, loss on extinguishment of debt and other non-operating items consisting primarily of equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to VIEs depend on market conditions or represent unusual items that do not necessarily relate to the underlying business of our segments.  Net realized investment gains (losses) and fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities (net of related amortization) may affect future earnings levels since our underlying business is long-term in nature and changes in our investment portfolio may impact our ability to earn the assumed interest rates needed to maintain the profitability of our business.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES 
    
  Our freestanding and embedded derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are held at fair value and are summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Our fixed index annuity products provide a guaranteed minimum rate of return and a higher potential return that is based on a percentage (the "participation rate") of the amount of increase in the value of a particular index, such as the Standard   Poor's 500 Index, over a specified period.  Typically, on each policy anniversary date, a new index period begins.  We are generally able to change the participation rate at the beginning of each index period during a policy year, subject to contractual minimums.  The Company accounts for the options attributed to the policyholder for the estimated life of the contract as embedded derivatives.  These accounting requirements often create volatility in the earnings from these products.  We typically buy call options (including call spreads) referenced to the applicable indices in an effort to offset or hedge potential increases to policyholder benefits resulting from increases in the particular index to which the policy's return is linked.  The notional amount of these options was   $2.8 billion   and   $2.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  We utilize United States Treasury interest rate futures primarily to hedge interest rate risk related to anticipated mortgage loan transactions. 
    
  We are required to establish an embedded derivative related to a modified coinsurance agreement pursuant to which we assume the risks of a block of health insurance business.  The embedded derivative represents the mark-to-market adjustment for approximately   $140 million   in underlying investments held by the ceding reinsurer. 
    
  We purchase certain fixed maturity securities that contain embedded derivatives that are required to be held at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet.  We have elected the fair value option to carry the entire security at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income.

The following table provides the pre-tax gains (losses) recognized in net income for derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedges for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): 

Derivative Counterparty Risk 
    
  If the counterparties to the call options fail to meet their obligations, we may recognize a loss.  We limit our exposure to such a loss by diversifying among several counterparties believed to be strong and creditworthy.  At   September 30, 2016  , all of our counterparties were rated "A-" or higher by S P Global Ratings ("S P").   
    
  We enter into exchange-traded interest rate future contracts.  The contracts are marked to market and margined on a daily basis. The Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to master netting arrangements with its counterparties related to entering into various derivative contracts.  Exchange-traded derivatives require margin accounts which we offset.

The following table summarizes information related to derivatives with master netting arrangements or collateral as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in millions): 

REINSURANCE 
    
  The cost of reinsurance ceded totaled   $32.2 million   and   $33.1 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $97.3 million   and   $100.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We deduct this cost from insurance policy income.  Reinsurance recoveries netted against insurance policy benefits totaled   $31.7 million   and   $37.3 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $113.3 million   and   $130.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  From time-to-time, we assume insurance from other companies.  Any costs associated with the assumption of insurance are amortized consistent with the method used to amortize deferred acquisition costs.  Reinsurance premiums assumed totaled   $8.3 million   and   $9.6 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $25.8 million   and   $29.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In December 2013,   two   of our insurance subsidiaries with long-term care business (Washington National Insurance Company ("Washington National") and Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company ("BCLIC")) entered into   100%   coinsurance agreements ceding   $495 million   of long-term care reserves to BRe.  Pursuant to the agreements, the Company paid an additional premium of   $96.9 million   to BRe and an amount equal to the related net liabilities.  BRe is a reinsurer that is not licensed or accredited by the states of domicile (Indiana and New York, respectively) of the insurance subsidiaries ceding the long-term care business and BRe is not rated by A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best").  As a result of its non-accredited status, BRe was required to provide collateral which meets the regulatory requirements of the states of domicile in order for our insurance subsidiaries to obtain full credit in their statutory financial statements for the reinsurance receivables due from BRe.  Such collateral was required to be held in market value trusts subject to   7%   over collateralization, investment guidelines and periodic true-up provisions.

In September 2016, we terminated the reinsurance agreements with BRe and recaptured the ceded business as further described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".  As a result of the recapture, we were required to value the assets and liabilities as of the date of recapture based on valuation methodologies that are consistent with the methodologies used by CNO to value its other investments and insurance liabilities.  Accordingly, we recognized a loss on the recapture of the long-term care business as summarized below (dollars in millions): 

INCOME TAXES 
    
  The Company's interim tax expense is based upon the estimated annual effective tax rate for the respective period.  Under authoritative guidance, certain items are required to be excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation.  Such items include changes in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets resulting from changes in projections of income expected to be available in future years, and items deemed to be unusual, infrequent, or that can not be reliably estimated.  In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to that item is treated discretely and is reported in the same period as the related item.  The components of income tax expense are as follows (dollars in millions):

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the estimated annual effective rate, before discrete items, reflected in the consolidated statement of operations is as follows: 

The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was lower than the effective U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a   $10.5 million   reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance reflecting higher   2016   expected taxable income than previously reflected in our deferred tax valuation allowance model. 
    
  Our total tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , includes   $11.0 million   of reductions to the deferred tax valuation allowance related to adjustments to future expected taxable income reflected in our deferred tax valuation allowance model and   $8.3 million   of increased tax expense primarily related to IRS exam adjustments.  The reduction to the deferred tax valuation allowance primarily relates to higher expected non-life income consistent with our current investment strategies, the impacts of the recapture of reinsurance agreements with BRe and IRS examination adjustments. 
    
  The components of the Company's income tax assets and liabilities are summarized below (dollars in millions):

Our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, capital loss carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs").  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. 
    
  A reduction of the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets by establishing a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, all available evidence, both positive and negative, shall be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. This assessment requires significant judgment and considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, and tax planning strategies. We evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for our deferred income tax assets on an ongoing basis.  The realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate type during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our capital loss carryforwards and life and non-life NOLs expire. 
    
  Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that   $700.8 million   of our net deferred tax assets of   $892.8 million   will be realized through future taxable earnings.  Accordingly, we have established a deferred tax valuation allowance of   $192.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   (  $182.0 million   of which relates to our net federal operating loss carryforwards and   $10.0 million   relates to state operating loss carryforwards).  We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in the future. If future results are less than projected, an increase to the valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax asset, which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded. 
    
  We use a deferred tax valuation model to assess the need for a valuation allowance.  Our model is adjusted to reflect changes in our projections of future taxable income including changes resulting from investment strategies, the impact of the sale or reinsurance of business and the recapture of business previously ceded.  Our estimates of future taxable income are based on evidence we consider to be objective and verifiable.  
    
  Our projection of future taxable income for purposes of determining the valuation allowance is based on our adjusted average annual taxable income which is assumed to increase by   3 percent   for the next   five   years, and level taxable income is assumed thereafter.  In the projections used for our analysis, our adjusted average taxable income, adjusted for the reinsurance recapture, of approximately   $335 million   consisted of   $85 million   of non-life taxable income and   $250 million   of life taxable income. 
    
  Recovery of our deferred tax asset is dependent on achieving the level of future taxable income projected in our deferred tax valuation model and failure to do so could result in an increase in the valuation allowance in a future period.  Any future increase in the valuation allowance may result in additional income tax expense and reduce shareholders' equity, and such an increase could have a significant impact upon our earnings in the future. 
    
  The Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") limits the extent to which losses realized by a non-life entity (or entities) may offset income from a life insurance company (or companies) to the lesser of:  (i)   35 percent   of the income of the life insurance company; or (ii)   35 percent   of the total loss of the non-life entities (including NOLs of the non-life entities).  There is no similar limitation on the extent to which losses realized by a life insurance entity (or entities) may offset income from a non-life entity (or entities).  This limitation is the primary reason a valuation allowance for NOLs is required. 
    
  Section 382 of the Code imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to use its NOLs when the company undergoes an ownership change.  Future transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an ownership change for Section 382 income tax purposes.  Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, additional repurchases under our securities repurchase program, issuances of common stock and acquisitions or sales of shares of CNO stock by certain holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold or may accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding common stock for their own account.  Many of these transactions are beyond our control.  If an additional ownership change were to occur for purposes of Section 382, we would be required to calculate an annual restriction on the use of our NOLs to offset future taxable income.  The annual restriction would be calculated based upon the value of CNO's equity at the time of such ownership change, multiplied by a federal long-term tax exempt rate (  2.08 percent   at   September 30, 2016  ), and the annual

restriction could limit our ability to use a substantial portion of our NOLs to offset future taxable income.  We regularly monitor ownership change (as calculated for purposes of Section 382) and, as of   September 30, 2016  , we were below the   50 percent   ownership change level that would trigger further impairment of our ability to utilize our NOLs. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.3 billion   of federal NOLs, net of unrecognized tax benefits.  The following table summarizes the expiration dates of our loss carryforwards prior to and as adjusted for the unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in millions): 

We also had deferred tax assets related to NOLs for state income taxes of   $12.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The related state NOLs are available to offset future state taxable income in certain states through 2025. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, we had not recorded a tax benefit for   $477.4 million   of NOLs related to two uncertain tax positions: (i)   $280.7 million   of life NOLs and   $130.0 million   of non-life NOLs related to the classification of the loss on our investment in Conseco Senior Health Insurance Company when it was transferred to an independent trust in 2008; and (ii)   $66.7 million   of non-life NOLs related to a bad debt deduction with respect to a stock purchase loan made by our Predecessor to a member of its board of directors. 
    
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") on these matters.  The Company has signed and returned settlement documentation to the IRS for its countersignature.  The settlement is expected to result in a reduction to tax expense of approximately   $120 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016 (the period in which these matters were settled and the fully executed documentation is expected to be received).  The   $120 million   expected benefit includes: (i) a   $98.2 million   tax benefit related to additional life NOLs; (ii) a   $17.1 million   tax benefit related to additional non-life NOLs (net of an increase to the deferred tax valuation allowance of   $51.7 million  ); and (iii) a   $4.4 million   reduction in interest recognized in prior periods on alternative minimum tax that will no longer be required to be paid. 
    
  The additional life NOLs related to the settlement are expected to offset our life taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 that was not previously offset by life NOLs and the tax gain realized on the recapture of the ceded long-term

care business from BRe.  The utilization of these NOLs will reduce the tax that we would otherwise pay by approximately   $64 million   in the near term (  $98 million   of tax benefit less the   $34 million   of additional deferred tax valuation allowance on the value of non-life NOLs which will no longer be used to offset life taxable income).  The settlement will also reduce the amount of current income tax accrued at   September 30, 2016  , as presented in the components of income tax assets and liabilities schedule provided in this note to consolidated financial statements by approximately   $40 million  . 
    
  We expect all of the additional life NOLs will be utilized toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.  After all of the life NOLs are utilized, we will begin making cash tax payments equal to the effective federal tax rate applied to   65 percent   of our life insurance company taxable income due to the limitations on the extent to which we can use non-life NOLs to offset life insurance company taxable income.  We will continue to pay tax on   65 percent   of our life insurance company taxable income until all non-life NOLs are utilized or expire. 
    
  The IRS has also begun an examination of 2011 and 2012.  In connection with this exam, we have agreed to extend the statute of limitations for 2011 through 2013 to September 30, 2018.  The Company s various state income tax returns are generally open for tax years beginning in 2013, based on individual state statutes of limitation.  Generally, for tax years which generate NOLs, capital losses or tax credit carryforwards, the statute remains open until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which such carryforwards are utilized.  The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty.  If the Company s tax audits are not resolved in a manner consistent with management s expectations, the Company may be required to adjust its provision for income taxes. 

NOTES PAYABLE - DIRECT CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS 
    
  The following notes payable were direct corporate obligations of the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in millions): 

Revolving Credit Agreement 
    
  On May 19, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement, with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent (the "Agent"), and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Revolving Credit Agreement").  On May 19, 2015, the Company made an initial drawing of   $100.0 million   under the Revolving Credit Agreement, resulting in   $50.0 million   available for additional borrowings.  The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on May 19, 2019. 
    
  The interest rates with respect to loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement are based on, at the Company's option, a floating base rate (defined as a per annum rate equal to the highest of: (i) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%  ; (ii) the "prime rate" of the Agent; and (iii) the eurodollar rate for a one-month interest period plus an applicable margin of initially   1.00%   per annum), or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of initially   2.00%   per annum.  At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement was   2.52 percent  .  In addition, the daily average undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Agreement accrues a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears.  The applicable margin for, and the commitment fee applicable to, the Revolving Credit Agreement, will be adjusted from time-to-time pursuant to a ratings based pricing grid.

The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain (each as calculated in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement): (i) a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than   30.0 percent   (such ratio was   20.5 percent   at   September 30, 2016  ); (ii) an aggregate ratio of total adjusted capital to company action level risk-based capital for the Company's insurance subsidiaries of not less than   250 percent   (such ratio was estimated to be   458 percent   at   September 30, 2016  ); and (iii) a minimum consolidated net worth of not less than the sum of (x)   $2,674 million   plus (y)   50.0%   of the net equity proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale of equity interests in the Company (the Company's consolidated net worth was   $3,638.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to the minimum requirement of   $2,680.0 million  ). 
    
  Scheduled Repayment of our Direct Corporate Obligations    
    
  The scheduled repayment of our direct corporate obligations was as follows at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions): 

INVESTMENT BORROWINGS 
    
  Three   of the Company's insurance subsidiaries (Washington National, Bankers Life and Casualty Company ("Bankers Life") and Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company ("Colonial Penn")) are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB").  As members of the FHLB, our insurance subsidiaries have the ability to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLB.  We are required to hold certain minimum amounts of FHLB common stock as a condition of membership in the FHLB, and additional amounts based on the amount of the borrowings.  At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the FHLB common stock was   $71.2 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , collateralized borrowings from the FHLB totaled   $1.6 billion   and the proceeds were used to purchase fixed maturity securities.  The borrowings are classified as investment borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The borrowings are collateralized by investments with an estimated fair value of   $2.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , which are maintained in a custodial account for the benefit of the FHLB.  Substantially all of such investments are classified as fixed maturities, available for sale, in our consolidated balance sheet.

The following summarizes the terms of the borrowings from the FHLB by our insurance subsidiaries (dollars in millions): 

The variable rate borrowings are pre-payable on each interest reset date without penalty.  The fixed rate borrowings are pre-payable subject to payment of a yield maintenance fee based on prevailing market interest rates.  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate yield maintenance fee to prepay all fixed rate borrowings was   $6.5 million  . 
    
  Interest expense of   $12.3 million   and   $7.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, was recognized related to total borrowings from the FHLB.

CHANGES IN COMMON STOCK 
    
  Changes in the number of shares of common stock outstanding were as follows (shares in thousands): 

____________________ 
           (a) 
    Such amount was reduced by   190 thousand   shares which were tendered to the Company for the payment of required federal and state tax withholdings owed on the vesting of restricted and performance stock. 
       
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased   11.7 million   shares of common stock for   $203.0 million   under our securities repurchase program.  The Company had remaining repurchase authority of   $252.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  In September 2016, we suspended our share repurchase program for the remainder of 2016 in connection with the termination of the reinsurance agreements with BRe and recapture of the ceded business as further described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off". 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , dividends declared on common stock totaled   $40.8 million   (  $0.23   per common share).  In May 2016, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend to   $0.08   per share from   $0.07   per share. 

SALES INDUCEMENTS 
    
  Certain of our annuity products offer sales inducements to contract holders in the form of enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments in the initial period of the contract.  Certain of our life insurance products offer persistency bonuses credited to the contract holders balance after the policy has been outstanding for a specified period of time.  These enhanced rates and persistency bonuses are considered sales inducements in accordance with GAAP.  Such amounts are deferred and amortized in the same manner as deferred acquisition costs.  Sales inducements deferred totaled   $2.8 million   and   $2.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Amounts amortized totaled   $7.1 million   and   $10.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The unamortized balance of deferred sales inducements was   $53.1 million   and   $57.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The balance of insurance liabilities for persistency bonus benefits was   $.6 million   and   $.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  Pending Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  Certain contracts with customers are specifically excluded from this guidance, including insurance contracts. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance also requires additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  In March 2016, the FASB issued amendments that clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In July 2015, the guidance was updated and will now be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and permits two methods of transition upon adoption; full retrospective and modified retrospective.  Under the full retrospective method, prior periods would be restated under the new revenue standard, providing for comparability in all periods presented.  Under the modified retrospective method, prior periods would not be restated.  Instead, revenues and other disclosures for pre-2017 periods would be provided in the notes to the financial statements as previously reported under the current revenue standard.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption.

In May 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires additional disclosures related to short-duration contracts.  The guidance will require insurance entities to disclose for annual reporting periods information about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses.  The guidance also requires insurance entities to disclose information about significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, including reasons for the change and the effects on the financial statements.  Additionally, the guidance requires insurance entities to disclose for annual and interim reporting periods a rollforward of the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses.  For health insurance claims, the guidance requires the disclosure of the total of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included in the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and the interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have on its disclosures upon adoption.  The adoption of this guidance will have no effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities which made targeted improvements to GAAP as follows: 
    
           (i) 
    Require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 
              (ii) 
    Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 
              (iii) 
    Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 
              (iv) 
    Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 
              (v) 
    Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 
              (vi) 
    Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 
              (vii) 
    Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. 
       
  An entity should apply this guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the guidance.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of the guidance is not permitted; except that item (v) above is permitted to be adopted early as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for leases, requiring lessees to report most leases on their balance sheets, regardless of whether the lease is classified as a finance lease or an operating lease.  For lessees, the initial lease liability is equal to the present value of future lease payments, and a corresponding asset, adjusted for certain items, is also recorded.  Expense recognition for lessees will remain similar to current accounting requirements for capital and operating leases.  The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP.  In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after

December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts.  An entity performing the assessment under this guidance is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with a four-step decision sequence.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance requires all income tax effects of stock-based compensation awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.  The new guidance also allows an employer to withhold shares upon settlement of an award to satisfy the employer's tax withholding requirements up to the highest marginal tax rate applicable to employees, without resulting in liability classification of the award.  Current guidance strictly limits the withholding to the employer's minimum statutory tax withholding requirement.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Transition guidance varies between retrospective, modified retrospective and prospective depending on the specific change required.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.  The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, and others.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE.  The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 
    
  Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to measuring the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity which provides a measurement alternative for an entity that consolidates collateralized financing entities.  A collateralized financing entity is a VIE with no more than nominal equity that holds financial assets and issues beneficial interests in those financial assets; the beneficial interests have contractual recourse only to the related assets of the collateralized financing entity and are classified as financial liabilities.  If elected, the alternative method results in the reporting entity measuring both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of the collateralized financing entity using the more observable of the two fair value measurements, which effectively removes measurement differences between the financial assets and the financial liabilities of the collateralized financing entity previously recorded as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling and other beneficial interests and as an adjustment to appropriated retained earnings.  The reporting entity continues to measure its own beneficial interests in the collateralized financing entity (other than those that represent compensation for services) at fair value.  The guidance was effective for the Company for interim and

annual periods beginning in 2016.  A reporting entity may apply the guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption.  A reporting entity may also apply the guidance retrospectively to all relevant prior periods.  The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which updates the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain legal entities.  Such guidance: (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (iii) affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (iv) provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for certain investment funds.  The guidance was effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning in 2016.  A reporting entity may apply the guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption.  A reporting entity may also apply the guidance retrospectively to all relevant prior periods.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions in the normal course of business, in which claims for compensatory and punitive damages are asserted, some for substantial amounts.  We recognize an estimated loss from these loss contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Some of the pending matters have been filed as purported class actions and some actions have been filed in certain jurisdictions that permit punitive damage awards that are disproportionate to the actual damages incurred.  The amounts sought in certain of these actions are often large or indeterminate and the ultimate outcome of certain actions is difficult to predict.  In the event of an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate liability may be in excess of the liabilities we have established and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the resolution of pending or future litigation may involve modifications to the terms of outstanding insurance policies or could impact the timing and amount of rate increases, which could adversely affect the future profitability of the related insurance policies.  Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal, factual and other defenses available to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company does not believe that it is probable that the ultimate liability from either pending or threatened legal actions, after consideration of existing loss provisions, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows.  However, given the inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, there exists the possibility that such legal actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
    
  In addition to the inherent difficulty of predicting litigation outcomes, particularly those that will be decided by a jury, some matters purport to seek substantial or an unspecified amount of damages for unsubstantiated conduct spanning several years based on complex legal theories and damages models.  The alleged damages typically are indeterminate or not factually supported in the complaint, and, in any event, the Company's experience indicates that monetary demands for damages often bear little relation to the ultimate loss.  In some cases, plaintiffs are seeking to certify classes in the litigation and class certification either has been denied or is pending and we have filed oppositions to class certification or sought to decertify a prior class certification.  In addition, for many of these cases: (i) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (ii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (iii) there are novel legal issues presented.  Accordingly, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, or predict the timing of the eventual resolution of these matters.  The Company reviews these matters on an ongoing basis.  When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, the Company bases its assessment on the expected ultimate outcome following all appeals. 
    
  On September 29, 2016, BCLIC and Washington National commenced an arbitration proceeding seeking compensatory, consequential and punitive damages against BRe based upon BRe s incurable material breaches of the long-term care reinsurance agreements, conversion, fraud, and breaches of fiduciary duties and the obligation to deal honestly and in good faith.  In addition, on September 29, 2016, a complaint was filed by BCLIC and Washington National in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company and Washington National Insurance Company v. Moshe M. Feuer, Scott Taylor and David Levy, Case No. 16-cv-7646, alleging, among other claims, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent misrepresentation/fraudulent concealment, aiding and abetting a fraud, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.  These allegations relate to the long-term care reinsurance agreements between BRe and BCLIC and Washington National, respectively, and emanate from the undisclosed relationships between and among the defendants (who were the principal owners and officers of BRe) and Platinum Partners, LP ("Platinum") and its affiliates.  BCLIC and Washington National intend to vigorously pursue their claims for damages and other remedies in the arbitration and the litigation described above. 
  Regulatory Examinations and Fines 
    
  Insurance companies face significant risks related to regulatory investigations and actions.  Regulatory investigations generally result from matters related to sales or underwriting practices, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claim payments and procedures, product design, product disclosure, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, procedures related to canceling policies, changing the way cost of insurance charges are calculated for certain life insurance products or recommending unsuitable products to customers.  We are, in the ordinary course of our business, subject to various examinations, inquiries and information requests from state, federal and other authorities.  The ultimate outcome of these regulatory actions (including the

costs of complying with information requests and policy reviews) cannot be predicted with certainty.  In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of liabilities we have established and we could suffer significant reputational harm as a result of these matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In August 2011, we were notified of an examination to be done on behalf of a number of states for the purpose of determining compliance with unclaimed property laws by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Such examination has included inquiries related to the use of data available on the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify instances where benefits under life insurance policies, annuities and retained asset accounts are payable.  We are continuing to provide information to the examiners in response to their requests.  A total of   38   states and the District of Columbia are currently participating in this examination.

INVESTMENTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary with respect to certain VIEs, which are consolidated in our financial statements.  In consolidating the VIEs, we consistently use the financial information most recently distributed to investors in the VIE. 
    
  All of the VIEs are collateralized loan trusts that were established to issue securities to finance the purchase of corporate loans and other permitted investments.  The assets held by the trusts are legally isolated and not available to the Company.  The liabilities of the VIEs are expected to be satisfied from the cash flows generated by the underlying loans held by the trusts, not from the assets of the Company.  The Company has no financial obligation to the VIEs beyond its investment in each VIE. 
    
  Certain of our insurance subsidiaries are noteholders of the VIEs.  Another subsidiary of the Company is the investment manager for the VIEs.  As such, it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs which materially impacts the economic performance of the VIEs.  
    
  The following tables provide supplemental information about the assets and liabilities of the VIEs which have been consolidated in accordance with authoritative guidance (dollars in millions):

The investment portfolios held by the VIEs are primarily comprised of commercial bank loans to corporate obligors which are almost entirely rated below-investment grade.  At   September 30, 2016  , such loans had an amortized cost of   $1,788.2 million  ; gross unrealized gains of   $12.0 million  ; gross unrealized losses of   $5.8 million  ; and an estimated fair value of   $1,794.4 million  . 
    
  The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the investments held by the VIEs at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity.  Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties. 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the VIEs recognized net realized investment losses of   $13.3 million  , which were comprised of   $12.1 million   of net losses from the sales of fixed maturities, and   $1.2 million   of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , the VIEs recognized net realized investment losses of   $4.3 million  , which were comprised of   $.7 million   of net losses from the sales of fixed maturities, and   $3.6 million   of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   one   investment held by the VIEs in default or considered nonperforming with an amortized cost and carrying value of   $.7 million   and   $.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   $186.6 million   of investments held by the VIEs were sold which resulted in gross investment losses (before income taxes) of   $20.3 million  .  During the first   nine   months of   2015  ,   $47.3 million   of investments held by the VIEs were sold which resulted in gross investment losses (before income taxes) of   $1.1 million  .

At   September 30, 2016  , the VIEs held:  (i) investments with a fair value of   $142.8 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $.7 million   that had been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months; and (ii) investments with a fair value of   $278.9 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $5.1 million   that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  , the VIEs held: (i) investments with a fair value of   $1,178.7 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $23.9 million   that had been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months; and (ii) investments with a fair value of   $294.3 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $22.3 million   that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. 
    
  The investments held by the VIEs are evaluated for other-than-temporary declines in fair value in a manner that is consistent with the Company's fixed maturities, available for sale. 
    
  In addition, the Company, in the normal course of business, makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the investment manager.  These structured securities include asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.  Our maximum exposure to loss on these securities is limited to our cost basis in the investment.  We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these structured securities due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the total principal amount of the individual structured securities and the level of credit subordination which reduces our obligation to absorb gains or losses. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we held investments in various limited partnerships, in which we are not the primary beneficiary, totaling   $272.2 million   (classified as other invested assets).  At   September 30, 2016  , we had unfunded commitments to these partnerships of   $234.7 million  .  Our maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of our investment.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and, therefore, represents an exit price, not an entry price.  We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including fixed maturities, equity securities, trading securities, investments held by VIEs, derivatives, separate account assets and embedded derivatives.  We carry our company-owned life insurance policy, which is invested in a series of mutual funds, at its cash surrender value which approximates fair value.  In addition, we disclose fair value for certain financial instruments, including mortgage loans, policy loans, cash and cash equivalents, insurance liabilities for interest-sensitive products, investment borrowings, notes payable and borrowings related to VIEs. 
    
  The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments is largely dependent on the level to which pricing is based on observable inputs.  Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices would be considered to have fair values based on the highest level of observable inputs, and little judgment would be utilized in measuring fair value.  Financial instruments that rarely trade would often have fair value based on a lower level of observable inputs, and more judgment would be utilized in measuring fair value. 
    
  Valuation Hierarchy 
    
  There is a three-level hierarchy for valuing assets or liabilities at fair value based on whether inputs are observable or unobservable. 

Level 1   includes assets and liabilities valued using inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Our Level 1 assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents and exchange traded securities. 

Level 2   includes assets and liabilities valued using inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in a market that is not active, observable inputs, or observable inputs that can be corroborated by market data.  Level 2 assets and liabilities include those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services using models or other valuation methodologies.  These models consider various inputs such as credit rating, maturity, corporate credit spreads, reported trades and other inputs that are observable or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by transactions executed in the marketplace.  Financial assets in this category primarily include:  certain publicly registered and privately placed corporate fixed maturity securities; certain government or agency securities; certain mortgage and asset-backed securities; certain equity securities; most investments held by our consolidated VIEs; certain mutual fund investments; most short-term investments; and non-exchange-traded derivatives such as call options.  Financial liabilities in this category include investment borrowings, notes payable and borrowings related to VIEs. 

Level 3   includes assets and liabilities valued using unobservable inputs that are used in model-based valuations that contain management assumptions.  Level 3 assets and liabilities include those financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on broker/dealer quotes, pricing services or internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.  Financial assets in this category include certain corporate securities (primarily certain below-investment grade privately placed securities), certain structured securities, mortgage loans, and other less liquid securities.  Financial liabilities in this category include our insurance liabilities for interest-sensitive products, which includes embedded derivatives (including embedded derivatives related to our fixed index annuity products and to a modified coinsurance arrangement) since their values include significant unobservable inputs including actuarial assumptions. 
       
  At each reporting date, we classify assets and liabilities into the three input levels based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value for each asset and liability reported at fair value.  This classification is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction and overall market conditions.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement and the ultimate classification of each asset and liability requires judgment and is subject to change from period to period based on the observability of the valuation inputs.  Any transfers between levels

are reported as having occurred at the beginning of the period.  There were   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 in both the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The vast majority of our fixed maturity and equity securities, including those held in trading portfolios and those held by consolidated VIEs, short-term and separate account assets use Level 2 inputs for the determination of fair value.  These fair values are obtained primarily from independent pricing services, which use Level 2 inputs for the determination of fair value.  Our Level 2 assets are valued as follows: 
    
     Fixed maturities available for sale, equity securities and trading securities 
    
  Corporate securities   are generally priced using market and income approaches.  Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets, issuer rating, benchmark yields, maturity, and credit spreads. 
    
  U.S. Treasuries and obligations of U.S. Government corporations and agencies   are generally priced using the market approach. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets and maturity. 
    
  States and political subdivisions   are generally priced using the market approach. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets, new issuances and credit spreads. 
    
  Asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations   are generally priced using market and income approaches. Inputs generally consist of quoted prices in inactive markets, spreads on actively traded securities, expected prepayments, expected credit default rates, delinquencies, and issue specific information including, but not limited to, collateral type, seniority and vintage. 
    
  Equity securities   (primarily comprised of non-redeemable preferred stock) are generally priced using the market approach. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets, issuer rating, benchmark yields, maturity, and credit spreads. 

Investments held by VIEs  
       
  Corporate securities   are generally priced using market and income approaches using pricing vendors.  Inputs generally consist of issuer rating, benchmark yields, maturity, and credit spreads. 

Other invested assets - derivatives 
       
  The fair value measurements for derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation, are determined based on the consideration of several inputs including closing exchange or over-the-counter market price quotes; time value and volatility factors underlying options; market interest rates; and non-performance risk.   
    
  Third party pricing services normally derive security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information.  If there are no recently reported trades, the third party pricing services may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are discounted at an estimated risk-adjusted market rate.  The number of prices obtained for a given security is dependent on the Company's analysis of such prices as further described below. 
    
  As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, we have control processes designed to ensure that the fair values received from third-party pricing sources are reasonable and the valuation techniques and assumptions used appear reasonable and consistent with prevailing market conditions.  Additionally, when inputs are provided by third-party pricing sources, we have controls in place to review those inputs for reasonableness.  As part of these controls, we perform monthly quantitative and qualitative analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.  The Company's analysis includes:  (i) a review of the methodology used by third party pricing services;

(ii) where available, a comparison of multiple pricing services' valuations for the same security; (iii) a review of month to month price fluctuations; (iv) a review to ensure valuations are not unreasonably dated; and (v) back testing to compare actual purchase and sale transactions with valuations received from third parties.  As a result of such procedures, the Company may conclude the prices received from third parties are not reflective of current market conditions.  In those instances, we may request additional pricing quotes or apply internally developed valuations.  However, the number of such instances is insignificant and the aggregate change in value of such investments is not materially different from the original prices received. 
    
  The categorization of the fair value measurements of our investments priced by independent pricing services was based upon the Company's judgment of the inputs or methodologies used by the independent pricing services to value different asset classes.  Such inputs include:  benchmark yields, reported trades, broker dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.  The Company categorizes such fair value measurements based upon asset classes and the underlying observable or unobservable inputs used to value such investments. 
    
  For securities that are not priced by pricing services and may not be reliably priced using pricing models, we obtain broker quotes.  These broker quotes are non-binding and     represent an exit price, but assumptions used to establish the fair value may not be observable and therefore represent Level 3 inputs.  Approximately   42 percent   of our Level 3 fixed maturity securities were valued using unadjusted broker quotes or broker-provided valuation inputs.  The remaining Level 3 fixed maturity investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs.  For these securities, we use internally developed valuations.  Key assumptions used to determine fair value for these securities may include risk premiums, projected performance of underlying collateral and other factors involving significant assumptions which may not be reflective of an active market.  For certain investments, we use a matrix or model process to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are discounted at an estimated market rate.  The pricing matrix incorporates term interest rates as well as a spread level based on the issuer's credit rating, other factors relating to the issuer, and the security's maturity.  In some instances issuer-specific spread adjustments, which can be positive or negative, are made based upon internal analysis of security specifics such as liquidity, deal size, and time to maturity. 
    
  For certain embedded derivatives, we use actuarial assumptions in the determination of fair value which we consider to be Level 3 inputs.

For those financial instruments disclosed at fair value, we use the following methods and assumptions to determine the estimated fair values: 
    
  Mortgage loans and policy loans.    We discount future expected cash flows based on interest rates currently being offered for similar loans with similar risk characteristics.  We aggregate loans with similar characteristics in our calculations.  The fair value of policy loans approximates their carrying value. 
    
  Company-owned life insurance   is backed by a series of mutual funds and is carried at cash surrender value which approximates estimated fair value. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents   include commercial paper, invested cash and other investments purchased with original maturities of less than three months.  We carry them at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair value. 
    
  Liabilities for policyholder account balances.    The estimated fair value of insurance liabilities for policyholder account balances was approximately equal to its carrying value as interest rates credited on the vast majority of account balances approximate current rates paid on similar products and because these rates are not generally guaranteed beyond one year. 
    
  Investment borrowings, notes payable and borrowings related to variable interest entities.    For publicly traded debt, we use current fair values.  For other notes, we use discounted cash flow analyses based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
    
  The fair value measurements for our financial instruments disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows (dollars in millions):

The following table provides additional information about the significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs developed internally by the Company to determine fair value for certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions): 

________________________________ 
           (a) 
    Corporate securities - The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our corporate securities is discount margin added to a riskless market yield. Significant increases (decreases) in discount margin in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
              (b) 
    Asset-backed securities - The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of these asset-backed securities is discount margin added to a riskless market yield. Significant increases (decreases) in discount margin in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
              (c) 
    Equity securities - The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of these equity securities is projected cash flows.  Generally, increases (decreases) in the projected cash flows would result in higher (lower) fair value measurements. 
              (d) 
    Other assets categorized as Level 3 - For these assets, there were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from third-party pricing sources. 
              (e) 
    Future policy benefits - The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our embedded derivatives associated with fixed index annuity products are projected portfolio yields, discount rates and surrender rates.  Increases (decreases) in projected portfolio yields in isolation would lead to a higher (lower) fair value measurement.  The discount rate is based on the Treasury rate adjusted by a margin.  Increases (decreases) in the discount rates would lead to a lower (higher) fair value measurement.  Assumed surrender rates are used to project how long the contracts remain in force.  Generally, the longer the contracts are assumed to be in force the higher the fair value of the embedded derivative.

    Equity security - This equity security represents an investment in a company that is constructing a manufacturing facility.  The significant unobservable input is the cash flows that will be generated upon completion of the manufacturing facility.  Given the nature of this investment, the best current indicator of value is the cost basis of the investment, which we believe approximates market value.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
       
  In this section, we review the consolidated financial condition of CNO at   September 30, 2016  , and its consolidated results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and, where appropriate, factors that may affect future financial performance. Please read this discussion in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Our statements, trend analyses and other information contained in this report and elsewhere (such as in filings by CNO with the SEC, press releases, presentations by CNO or its management or oral statements) relative to markets for CNO's products and trends in CNO's operations or financial results, as well as other statements, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements typically are identified by the use of terms such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "may," "will," "would," "contemplate," "possible," "attempt," "seek," "should," "could," "goal," "target," "on track," "comfortable with," "optimistic," "guidance," "outlook" and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently.  You should consider statements that contain these words carefully because they describe our expectations, plans, strategies and goals and our beliefs concerning future business conditions, our results of operations, financial position, and our business outlook or they state other "forward-looking" information based on currently available information.  The "Risk Factors" section of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the changes set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-Q provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements.  Assumptions and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements include, among other things: 

changes in or sustained low interest rates causing reductions in investment income, the margins of our fixed annuity and life insurance businesses, and sales of, and demand for, our products; 

expectations of lower future investment earnings may cause us to accelerate amortization, write down the balance of insurance acquisition costs or establish additional liabilities for insurance products; 

general economic, market and political conditions, including the performance of the financial markets which may affect the value of our investments as well as our ability to raise capital or refinance existing indebtedness and the cost of doing so; 

the ultimate outcome of lawsuits filed against us and other legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are subject; 

our ability to make anticipated changes to certain non-guaranteed elements of our life insurance products; 

our ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases on our health products, including our long-term care business; 

the receipt of any required regulatory approvals for dividend and surplus debenture interest payments from our insurance subsidiaries; 

mortality, morbidity, the increased cost and usage of health care services, persistency, the adequacy of our previous reserve estimates and other factors which may affect the profitability of our insurance products; 

changes in our assumptions related to deferred acquisition costs or the present value of future profits; 

the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the effect of potential ownership changes and tax rate changes on their value; 

our assumption that the positions we take on our tax return filings will not be successfully challenged by the IRS; 

57 

CNO FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  ___________________ 

changes in accounting principles and the interpretation thereof; 

our ability to continue to satisfy the financial ratio and balance requirements and other covenants of our debt agreements; 

our ability to achieve anticipated expense reductions and levels of operational efficiencies including improvements in claims adjudication and continued automation and rationalization of operating systems; 

performance and valuation of our investments, including the impact of realized losses (including other-than-temporary impairment charges); 

our ability to identify products and markets in which we can compete effectively against competitors with greater market share, higher ratings, greater financial resources and stronger brand recognition; 

our ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations and other cash needs; 

our ability to maintain effective controls over financial reporting; 

our ability to continue to recruit and retain productive agents and distribution partners; 

customer response to new products, distribution channels and marketing initiatives; 

our ability to achieve additional upgrades of the financial strength ratings of CNO and our insurance company subsidiaries as well as the impact of our ratings on our business, our ability to access capital, and the cost of capital; 

regulatory changes or actions, including those relating to regulation of the financial affairs of our insurance companies, such as the payment of dividends and surplus debenture interest to us, regulation of the sale, underwriting and pricing of products, and health care regulation affecting health insurance products;  

changes in the Federal income tax laws and regulations which may affect or eliminate the relative tax advantages of some of our products or affect the value of our deferred tax assets; 

availability and effectiveness of reinsurance arrangements, as well as the impact of any defaults or failure of reinsurers to perform; 

the performance of third party service providers and potential difficulties arising from outsourcing arrangements; 

the growth rate of sales, collected premiums, annuity deposits and assets; 

interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems; 

events of terrorism, cyber attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including losses from a disease pandemic; 

ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures in identifying, monitoring and managing risks; and  

the risk factors or uncertainties listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC. 
       
  Other factors and assumptions not identified above are also relevant to the forward-looking statements, and if they prove incorrect, could also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. 
    
  All written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement.  Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.  We assume no obligation to update or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, future events or developments, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting the forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a holding company for a group of insurance companies operating throughout the United States that develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products.  We focus on serving the senior and middle-income markets, which we believe are attractive, underserved, high growth markets.  We sell our products through three distribution channels: career agents, independent producers (some of whom sell one or more of our product lines exclusively) and direct marketing. 
    
  The Company s insurance segments are described below: 

Bankers Life,     which markets and distributes Medicare supplement insurance, interest-sensitive life insurance, traditional life insurance, fixed annuities and long-term care insurance products to the middle-income senior market through a dedicated field force of career agents, financial and investment advisors, and sales managers supported by a network of community-based sales offices.  The Bankers Life segment includes primarily the business of Bankers Life.  Bankers Life also has various distribution and marketing agreements with other insurance companies to use Bankers Life's career agents to distribute Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans ("PDP") products in exchange for a fee. 

Washington National,   which markets and distributes supplemental health (including specified disease, accident and hospital indemnity insurance products) and life insurance to middle-income consumers at home and at the worksite.  These products are marketed through Performance Matters Associates, Inc. ("PMA") and through independent marketing organizations and insurance agencies including worksite marketing.  The products being marketed are underwritten by Washington National.  This segment's business also includes certain closed blocks of annuities and Medicare supplement policies which are no longer being actively marketed by this segment and were primarily issued or acquired by Washington National. 

Colonial Penn  , which markets primarily graded benefit and simplified issue life insurance directly to customers in the senior middle-income market through television advertising, direct mail, the internet and telemarketing.  The Colonial Penn segment includes primarily the business of Colonial Penn. 
       
   In the fourth quarter of 2016, we will begin reporting the long-term care block recaptured from BRe as an additional business segment.

    Management believes that an adjusted analysis of net operating income provides a clearer comparison of the operating results of the Company from period to period because it excludes:  (i) net realized investment gains or losses, net of related amortization; (ii) fair value changes due to fluctuations in the interest rates used to discount embedded derivative liabilities related to our fixed index annuities, net of related amortization; (iii) fair value changes and amendment related to the agent deferred compensation plan; (iv) loss on reinsurance transaction; (v) loss on extinguishment of debt; and (vi)   other non-operating items consisting primarily of equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to variable interest entities  .  Net realized investment gains or losses include:  (i) gains or losses on the sales of investments; (ii) other-than-temporary impairments recognized through net income; and (iii) changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives.  Adjusted EBIT is presented as net operating income excluding corporate interest expense and income tax expense.  The table above reconciles the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measure. 
       
  In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its budgeting process, financial analysis of segment performance and in assessing the allocation of resources.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an investor s understanding of our financial performance and allows them to make more informed judgments about the Company as a whole.  These measures also highlight operating trends that might not otherwise be transparent.  However, Adjusted EBIT and net operating income are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to net income as measures of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, Adjusted EBIT and net operating income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.  Adjusted EBIT and net operating income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.  Our definitions and calculation of Adjusted EBIT and net operating income are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following tables and narratives summarize the operating results of our segments (dollars in millions):

           (a) 
    These non-GAAP measures as presented in the above table and in the following segment financial data and discussions of segment results exclude net realized investment gains (losses), fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities, net of related amortization, fair value changes and amendment related to the agent deferred compensation plan, equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to VIEs, net revenue pursuant to transition and support services agreements, loss on reinsurance transaction  ,   loss on extinguishment of debt and before income taxes.  These are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
       
  These non-GAAP financial measures of "pre-tax operating earnings" differ from "income (loss) before income taxes" as presented in our consolidated statement of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of realized investment gains (losses), fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities, net of related amortization, fair value changes and amendment related to the agent deferred compensation plan, equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to VIEs, net revenue pursuant to transition and support services agreements, loss on reinsurance transaction and loss on extinguishment of debt.  We measure segment performance excluding these items because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and trends in our business.  Our primary investment focus is on investment income to support our liabilities for insurance products as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains (losses), and a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business.  Realized investment gains (losses), fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities, fair value changes and amendment related to the agent deferred compensation plan and equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to VIEs depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.  However, "pre-tax operating earnings" does not replace "income (loss) before income taxes" as a measure of overall profitability.   
    
  We may experience realized investment gains (losses), which will affect future earnings levels since our underlying business is long-term in nature and we need to earn the assumed interest rates on the investments backing our liabilities for insurance products to maintain the profitability of our business.  In addition, management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in its budgeting process, financial analysis of segment performance and in assessing the allocation of resources.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an investor's understanding of our financial performance and allows them to make more informed judgments about the Company as a whole.  These measures also highlight operating trends that might not otherwise be transparent.  The table above reconciles the non-GAAP measure to the corresponding GAAP measure. 
    
  General:   CNO is the top tier holding company for a group of insurance companies operating throughout the United States that develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products.  We distribute these products through our Bankers Life segment, which utilizes a career agency force, through our Washington National segment, which utilizes independent producers and through our Colonial Penn segment, which utilizes direct response marketing.

           (a) 
    We calculate benefit ratios by dividing the related product's insurance policy benefits by insurance policy income. 
              (b) 
    We calculate the interest-adjusted benefit ratio (a non-GAAP measure) for Bankers Life's long-term care products by dividing such product's insurance policy benefits less the imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities by policy income.  These are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
       
  These non-GAAP financial measures of "interest-adjusted benefit ratios" differ from "benefit ratios" due to the deduction of imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities from the product's insurance policy benefits used to determine the ratio.  Interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of health products that are expected to be inforce for a longer duration of time, are not subject to unilateral changes in provisions (such as non-cancelable or guaranteed renewable contracts) and require the performance of various functions and services (including insurance protection) for an extended period of time.  The net cash flows from long-term care products generally cause an accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (accounted for as reserve increases) that will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (accounted for as reserve decreases).  Accordingly, as the policies age, the benefit ratio will typically increase, but the increase in benefits will be partially offset by the imputed interest income earned on the accumulated assets.  The interest-adjusted benefit ratio reflects the effects of such interest income offset (which is equal to the tabular interest on the related insurance liabilities).  Since interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of this product, management believes a benefit ratio that includes the effect of interest income is useful in analyzing product performance.  We utilize the interest-adjusted benefit ratio in measuring segment performance because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and trends in the business.  However, the "interest-adjusted benefit ratio" does not replace the "benefit ratio" as a measure of current period benefits to current period insurance policy income.  Accordingly, management reviews both "benefit ratios" and "interest-adjusted benefit ratios" when analyzing the financial results attributable to these products.  The imputed investment income earned on the accumulated assets backing Bankers Life's long-term care reserves was $70.1 million and $68.1 million in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was $205.6 million and $202.9 million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Total premium collections   were   $665.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up 2.7 percent from   2015   and were   $1,954.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , up 6.4 percent from   2015  , reflecting an increase in premiums from annuity products and strong persistency in the Medicare supplement and life blocks of business.  See "Premium Collections" for further analysis of Bankers Life's premium collections. 
    
  Average liabilities for insurance products, net of reinsurance ceded   were $15.4 billion in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up 4.6 percent from   2015   and were $15.1 billion in the first   nine   months of   2016  , up 2.1 percent from   2015  .  Such average

liabilities for long-term care products were increased by $337.8 million and $86.0 million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $182.0 million and $243.0 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, to reflect the premium deficiencies that would exist if unrealized gains on the assets backing such products had been realized and the proceeds from the sales of such assets were invested at then current yields.  Such increase is reflected as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Excluding the impact of the aforementioned item, the increase in average liabilities for insurance products was primarily due to new sales and the amounts added to policyholder account balances on interest-sensitive products. 
    
  Insurance policy income   is comprised of premiums earned on policies which provide mortality or morbidity coverage and fees and other charges assessed on other policies. 
    
  Net investment income on general account invested assets   (which excludes income on policyholder portfolios) was   $229.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up .7 percent from   2015  , and was   $676.2 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , down 1.6 percent from   2015  .  In the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net investment income reflects $4 million and nil, respectively, of higher (lower) investment income from alternative investments compared to the   2015   periods.  Prepayment income was $2.3 million and $5.3 million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was $7.9 million and $17.8 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Net investment income related to fixed index products   represents the change in the estimated fair value of options which are purchased in an effort to offset or hedge certain potential benefits accruing to the policyholders of our fixed index products.  Our fixed index products are designed so that investment income spread is expected to be more than adequate to cover the cost of the options and other costs related to these policies.  Net investment income (loss) related to fixed index products was   $15.6 million   and   $(31.1) million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $10.6 million   and   $(39.5) million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Such amounts were substantially offset by the corresponding charge (credit) to   amounts added to policyholder account balances - market value changes credited to policyholders  .      Such income and related charges fluctuate based on the value of options embedded in the segment's fixed index annuity policyholder account balances subject to this benefit and to the performance of the index to which the returns on such products are linked.  
    
  Fee revenue and other income   was   $9.6 million   and   $7.0 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $23.5 million   and   $19.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These amounts include revenues earned under distribution and marketing agreements to sell Medicare Advantage and PDP products of other insurance companies.  The increase reflects the larger in-force block of third party products. 
    
  Insurance policy benefits   fluctuated as a result of the factors summarized below for benefit ratios.  Benefit ratios are calculated by dividing the related insurance product s insurance policy benefits by insurance policy income. 
    
  The Medicare supplement business consists of both individual and group policies.  Government regulations generally require us to attain and maintain a ratio of total benefits incurred to total premiums earned (excluding changes in policy benefit reserves), after three years from the original issuance of the policy and over the lifetime of the policy, of not less than 65 percent on individual products and not less than 75 percent on group products, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles.  Since the insurance product liabilities we establish for Medicare supplement business are subject to significant estimates, the ultimate claim liability we incur for a particular period is likely to be different than our initial estimate.  Our benefit ratios were   72.5 percent   and   71.5 percent   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   72.2 percent   and   69.2 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We continue to expect the Medicare supplement benefit ratio to be in the range of 70 percent to 73 percent during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  The net cash flows from our long-term care products generally cause an accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (accounted for as reserve increases) which will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (accounted for as reserve decreases).  Accordingly, as the policies age, the benefit ratio typically increases, but the increase in reserves is partially offset by investment income earned on the accumulated assets.  The benefit ratio on our long-term care business in the Bankers Life segment was   137.7 percent   and   141.1 percent   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   135.1 percent   and   139.9 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The interest-adjusted benefit ratio on this business was   77.7 percent   and   83.8 percent   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   76.9 percent   and   83.8 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The interest-adjusted benefit ratio in the three and   nine   months ended

September 30, 2016  , was favorably impacted by $6 million and $19 million, respectively, of reserve releases related to policyholder decisions to surrender or reduce coverage following rate increases.  The interest-adjusted benefit ratio in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , excluding the favorable reserve releases related to rate increases was 82.6 percent and 82.4 percent, respectively.  We continue to expect the long-term care interest-adjusted benefit ratio to be in the range of 81 percent to 86 percent during the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the reserve-related impacts of rate increase actions.  We also expect that the impacts of rate increases will continue to favorably impact the interest-adjusted benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Our projections of estimated future profits on the long-term care block indicate that profits will be recognized in earlier years, followed by losses in later years.  We recognize future loss reserves during the period the block is profitable to offset the losses in the future period.  As a result of the projected future losses, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio will increase on this block as it ages and as new business becomes less of a component of the overall inforce.  We estimate the future loss reserve based on our current best estimates of morbidity, persistency, premium rates, maintenance expense, commissions and investment yields, which are generally updated annually.  We increased the future loss reserve related to our long-term care blocks of business by $8.4 million and $8.1 million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $25.4 million and $25.2 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The future loss reserves on this long-term care business totaled $183.7 million at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Amounts added to policyholder account balances - cost of interest credited to policyholders   were   $27.7 million   and   $29.3 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $83.3 million   and   $89.6 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The weighted average crediting rate for these products was 2.8 percent in both the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , and 2.8 percent in both the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  .  The average liabilities of the fixed interest annuity block were $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the liabilities related to these annuities reflects the lower sales of these products in the current low interest rate environment and consumer preference for fixed index products. 
    
  Amounts added to policyholder account balances for fixed index products represent a guaranteed minimum rate of return and a higher potential return that is based on a percentage (the "participation rate") of the amount of increase in the value of a particular index, such as the S P 500 Index, over a specified period.  Such amounts include our cost to fund the annual index credits, net of policies that are canceled prior to their anniversary date (classified as   cost of options to fund index credits, net of forfeitures  ).  Market value changes in the underlying indices during a specified period of time are classified as   market value changes credited to policyholders  .  Such market value changes are generally offset by the   net investment income related to fixed index products   discussed above. 
    
  Amortization related to operations   includes amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits.  Deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits are collectively referred to as "insurance acquisition costs".  Insurance acquisition costs are generally amortized either:  (i) in relation to the estimated gross profits for interest-sensitive life and annuity products; or (ii) in relation to actual and expected premium revenue for other products.  In addition, for interest-sensitive life and annuity products, we are required to adjust the total amortization recorded to date through the statement of operations if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates of future gross profits should be revised.  Accordingly, amortization for interest-sensitive life and annuity products is dependent on the profits realized during the period and on our expectation of future profits.  For other products, we amortize insurance acquisition costs in relation to actual and expected premium revenue, and amortization is only adjusted if expected premium revenue changes or if we determine the balance of these costs is not recoverable from future profits.  Bankers Life s amortization expense was   $43.8 million   and   $44.1 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $135.3 million   and   $143.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The lower amortization in the 2016 periods reflects higher persistency in the Medicare supplement and annuity blocks. 
    
  Interest expense on investment borrowings   represents interest expense on collateralized borrowings as further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled "Investment Borrowings".

Other operating costs and expenses   in our Bankers Life segment were   $105.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up 1.8 percent from   2015  , and were   $312.2 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , up 1.8 percent from   2015  .  Other operating costs and expenses include the following (dollars in millions): 

Net realized investment gains (losses)   fluctuate from period to period.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized net realized investment losses of $.7 million, which were comprised of: (i) $17.6 million of net gains from the sales of investments; (ii) the increase in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of $.1 million; and (iii) $18.4 million of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized net realized investment losses of $16.4 million, which were comprised of: (i) $6.0 million of net losses from the sales of investments (primarily fixed maturities); (ii) the decrease in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of $3.4 million; and (iii) $7.0 million of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income ($9.3 million, prior to the $2.3 million of impairment losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)).   
    
  Amortization related to net realized investment gains (losses)   is the increase or decrease in the amortization of insurance acquisition costs which results from realized investment gains or losses.  When we sell securities which back our interest-sensitive life and annuity products at a gain (loss) and reinvest the proceeds at a different yield, we increase (reduce) the amortization of insurance acquisition costs in order to reflect the change in estimated gross profits due to the gains (losses) realized and the resulting effect on estimated future yields.  Sales of fixed maturity investments resulted in an increase (decrease) in the amortization of insurance acquisition costs of $.2 million and $(.6) million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $.6 million and $(.6) million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Insurance policy benefits - fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities   represents fair value changes due to fluctuations in the interest rates used to discount embedded derivative liabilities related to our fixed index annuities. 
    
  Amortization related to fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities   is the increase or decrease in the amortization of insurance acquisition costs which results from changes in interest rates used to discount embedded derivative liabilities related to our fixed index annuities.

    We calculate benefit ratios by dividing the related product s insurance policy benefits by insurance policy income. 
              (b) 
    We calculate the interest-adjusted benefit ratio (a non-GAAP measure) for Washington National's supplemental health products by dividing such product s insurance policy benefits less the imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities by policy income.  These are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
       
  These non-GAAP financial measures of "interest-adjusted benefit ratios" differ from "benefit ratios" due to the deduction of imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities from the product s insurance policy benefits used to determine the ratio.  Interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of health products that are expected to be inforce for a longer duration of time, are not subject to unilateral changes in provisions (such as non-cancelable or guaranteed renewable contracts) and require the performance of various functions and services (including insurance protection) for an extended period of time.  The net cash flows from supplemental health products generally cause an accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (accounted for as reserve increases) that will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (accounted for as reserve decreases).  Accordingly, as the policies age, the benefit ratio will typically increase, but the increase in benefits will be partially offset by the imputed interest income earned on the accumulated assets.  The interest-adjusted benefit ratio reflects the effects of such interest income offset (which is equal to the tabular interest on the related insurance liabilities).  Since interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of these products, management believes a benefit ratio that includes the effect of interest income is useful in analyzing product performance.  We utilize the interest-adjusted benefit ratio in measuring segment performance because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and trends in the business.  However, the "interest-adjusted benefit ratio" does not replace the "benefit ratio" as a measure of current period benefits to current period insurance policy income.  Accordingly, management reviews both "benefit ratios" and "interest-adjusted benefit ratios" when analyzing the financial results attributable to these products.  The imputed investment income earned on the accumulated assets backing the supplemental health reserves was $34.3 million and $33.2 million in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was $100.9 million and $99.1 million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Total premium collections   were   $163.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down 1.3 percent from   2015  , and were   $494.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , up 1.6 percent from   2015  , driven by sales and persistency of the segment's supplemental health block; partially offset by lower Medicare supplement collected premiums due to the run-off of this block of business.  See "Premium Collections" for further analysis of fluctuations in premiums collected by product. 
    
  Average liabilities for insurance products, net of reinsurance ceded   were $4.0 billion in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up 1.6 percent from   2015  , and were $3.9 billion in the first   nine   months of   2016  , up 1.1 percent from   2015  , reflecting an increase in the supplemental health block; partially offset by the run-off of the annuity blocks.

Insurance policy income   is comprised of premiums earned on traditional insurance policies which provide mortality or morbidity coverage and fees and other charges assessed on other policies.  Such income increased in recent periods as supplemental health premiums have increased consistent with sales; partially offset by the decrease in Medicare supplement premiums. 
    
  Net investment income on general account invested assets   (which excludes income on policyholder portfolios) was   $66.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up 3.6 percent from   2015  , and was   $190.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , down .7 percent from   2015  .  The three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflect $1 million and $(1) million, respectively, of higher (lower) investment income from alternative investments compared to the 2015 periods. 
    
  Net investment income related to fixed index products   represents the change in the estimated fair value of options which are purchased in an effort to offset or hedge certain potential benefits accruing to the policyholders of our fixed index products. Our fixed index products are designed so that investment income spread is expected to be more than adequate to cover the cost of the options and other costs related to these policies.  Net investment income (loss) related to fixed index products was   $1.5 million   and   $(3.2) million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $.3 million   and   $(2.8) million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Such amounts were substantially offset by the corresponding charge to   amounts added to policyholder account balances - market value changes credited to policyholders  .  Such income and related charges fluctuate based on the value of options embedded in the segment's fixed index annuity policyholder account balances subject to this benefit and to the performance of the index to which the returns on such products are linked. 
    
  Trading account income related to policyholder accounts   represents the income on investments backing the market strategies of certain annuity products which provide for different rates of cash value growth based on the experience of a particular market strategy.  The income on our trading account securities is designed to substantially offset certain amounts included in insurance policy benefits related to the aforementioned annuity products. 
    
  Insurance policy benefits   fluctuated as a result of the factors summarized below.  Benefit ratios are calculated by dividing the related insurance product's insurance policy benefits by insurance policy income. 
    
  Washington National's supplemental health products (including specified disease, accident and hospital indemnity products) generally provide fixed or limited benefits.  For example, payments under cancer insurance policies are generally made directly to, or at the direction of, the policyholder following diagnosis of, or treatment for, a covered type of cancer.  Approximately three-fourths of our supplemental health policies inforce (based on policy count) are sold with return of premium or cash value riders.  The return of premium rider generally provides that after a policy has been inforce for a specified number of years or upon the policyholder reaching a specified age, we will pay to the policyholder, or a beneficiary under the policy, the aggregate amount of all premiums paid under the policy, without interest, less the aggregate amount of all claims incurred under the policy.  The cash value rider is similar to the return of premium rider, but also provides for payment of a graded portion of the return of premium benefit if the policy terminates before the return of premium benefit is earned.  Accordingly, the net cash flows from these products generally result in the accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (reflected in our earnings as reserve increases) which will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (reflected in our earnings as reserve decreases which offset the recording of benefit payments).  As the policies age, the benefit ratio will typically increase, but the increase in benefits will be partially offset by investment income earned on the accumulated assets.  The benefit ratio will fluctuate depending on the claim experience during the year.   
    
  Insurance margins (insurance policy income less insurance policy benefits) on supplemental health products were $22.6 million and $24.9 million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were $68.9 million and $61.3 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The margin in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year reflects higher benefit ratios and growth in the block; partially offset by the growth in premium income.  The margin in the first nine months of   2015   reflects $9 million of unfavorable reserve developments in the supplemental health block related to claims incurred in prior periods based on the completion of an in-depth review of recent claim trends in the block, including the impact of newer cancer treatments on claims.  The interest-adjusted benefit ratio on this supplemental health business was   59.8 percent   and   57.4 percent   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   59.7 percent   and   60.3 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We expect the supplemental health interest-adjusted benefit ratio to be in the 59 percent range during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Washington National's Medicare supplement business primarily consists of individual policies.  The insurance product liabilities we establish for our Medicare supplement business are subject to significant estimates and the ultimate claim liability we incur for a particular period is likely to be different than our initial estimate.  Governmental regulations generally require us to attain and maintain a ratio of total benefits incurred to total premiums earned (excluding changes in policy benefit reserves), after three years from the original issuance of the policy and over the lifetime of the policy, of not less than 65 percent on these products, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles.  Insurance margins (insurance policy income less insurance policy benefits) on these products were $4.7 million and $5.8 million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were $14.5 million and $19.4 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Such decreases reflect the run-off of this block of business. 
    
  Amounts added to policyholder account balances - cost of interest credited to policyholders   were   $3.3 million   and   $3.6 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $10.3 million   and   $11.0 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Amounts added to policyholder account balances for fixed index products represent a guaranteed minimum rate of return and a higher potential return that is based on a percentage (the "participation rate") of the amount of increase in the value of a particular index, such as the S P 500 Index, over a specified period.  Such amounts include our cost to fund the annual index credits, net of policies that are canceled prior to their anniversary date (classified as   cost of options to fund index credits, net of forfeitures  ).  Market value changes in the underlying indices during a specified period of time are classified as   market value changes credited to policyholders  .  Such market value changes are generally offset by the   net investment income related to fixed index products   discussed above. 
    
  Amortization related to operations   includes amortization of insurance acquisition costs.  Insurance acquisition costs are generally amortized in relation to actual and expected premium revenue, and amortization is only adjusted if expected premium revenue changes or if we determine the balance of these costs is not recoverable from future profits.  Such amounts were generally consistent with the related premium revenue.  A revision to our current assumptions could result in increases or decreases to amortization expense in future periods.  Washington National's amortization expense was   $14.3 million   and   $13.5 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $44.5 million   and   $42.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Interest expense on investment borrowings   represents interest expense on collateralized borrowings as further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled "Investment Borrowings". 
    
  Other operating costs and expenses   were   $47.0 million   and   $46.4 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $140.3 million   and   $137.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Other operating costs and expenses include commission expense of $17.7 million and $16.3 million in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $52.6 million and $50.9 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Net realized investment gains (losses)   fluctuate each period.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized net realized investment gains of $27.2 million, which were comprised of: (i) $24.3 million of net gains from the sales of investments; (ii) the increase in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of $.6 million; (iii) the increase in fair value of embedded derivatives related to a modified coinsurance agreement of $6.7 million; and (iv) $4.4 million of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized net realized investment losses of $5.3 million, which were comprised of: (i) $2.8 million of net gains from the sales of investments; (ii) the decrease in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of $1.1 million; (iii) the decrease in fair value of embedded derivatives related to a modified coinsurance agreement of $4.3 million; and (iv) $2.7 million of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income ($3.1 million, prior to the $.4 million of impairment losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)). 
    
  Amortization related to net realized investment gains (losses)   is the increase or decrease in the amortization of insurance acquisition costs which results from realized investment gains or losses.  When we sell securities which back our interest-sensitive life and annuity products at a gain (loss) and reinvest the proceeds at a different yield (or when we have the intent to sell the impaired investments before an anticipated recovery in value occurs), we increase (reduce) the amortization of insurance acquisition costs in order to reflect the change in estimated gross profits due to the gains (losses) realized and the

resulting effect on estimated future yields.  Sales of fixed maturity investments resulted in an increase in the amortization of insurance acquisition costs of   $.3 million   and   $.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Insurance policy benefits - fair value changes in embedded derivative liabilities   represents fair value changes due to fluctuations in the interest rates used to discount embedded derivative liabilities related to our fixed index annuities.

Colonial Penn (dollars in millions) 

This segment's results are significantly impacted by the accounting standard related to deferred acquisition costs.  We are not able to defer most of Colonial Penn's direct response advertising costs although such costs generate predictable sales and future in-force profits.  We plan to continue to invest in this segment's business, including the development of new products and markets.  The amount of our investment in new business during a particular period will have a significant impact on this segment's results.  We expect this segment to report approximately breakeven earnings in 2016. 
    
  Total premium collections   were   $70.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up 6.0 percent from   2015  , and were   $210.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , up 6.9 percent from   2015  .  The increase was driven by increased sales and steady persistency.  See "Premium Collections" for further analysis of Colonial Penn's premium collections.

Average liabilities for insurance products, net of reinsurance ceded   have increased as a result of growth in the core graded benefit and simplified issue life insurance block in this segment. 
    
  Insurance policy income   is comprised of premiums earned on policies which provide mortality or morbidity coverage and fees and other charges assessed on other policies.  The increase in such income reflects the growth in the block of graded benefit and simplified issue life insurance business.  
    
  Net investment income on general account invested assets   increased slightly in the   2016   periods primarily due to the increase in invested assets as a result of the growth in this segment. 
    
  Insurance policy benefits   fluctuated primarily due to the growth in this segment.  In addition, mortality was higher in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.   
    
  Amortization related to operations   includes amortization of insurance acquisition costs.  Insurance acquisition costs in the Colonial Penn segment are amortized in relation to actual and expected premium revenue, and amortization is only adjusted if expected premium revenue changes or if we determine the balance of these costs is not recoverable from future profits.  Such amounts were generally consistent with the related premium revenue and gross profits for such periods and the assumptions we made when we established the present value of future profits.  A revision to our current assumptions could result in increases or decreases to amortization expense in future periods. 
    
  Other operating costs and expenses   in our Colonial Penn segment fluctuate primarily due to changes in the marketing expenses incurred to generate new business.  Marketing expenses were higher in the   2016   periods as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to investments in new business and higher advertising costs (including the impacts of the political elections on television advertising costs).  We continue to face increased competition from other insurance companies who also distribute products through direct marketing.  In addition, the demand and cost of television advertising appropriate for Colonial Penn's campaigns has fluctuated widely in certain periods.  In some periods, increased advertising costs have resulted in decisions to lower our planned spending.  These factors may reoccur in the future.  
    
  Net realized investment gains (losses)   fluctuated each period.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized net realized investment losses of $.2 million, which were comprised of: (i) $.7 million of net gains from the sales of investments; (ii) the decrease in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of $.1 million; and (iii) $.8 million of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized net realized investment losses of $1.0 million, which were comprised of: (i) $.4 million of net losses from the sales of investments (primarily fixed maturities); (ii) the decrease in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of $.2 million; and (iii) $.4 million of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income ($.7 million, prior to the $.3 million of impairment losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)). 
    
  Management believes that an analysis of Adjusted EBIT for Colonial Penn, separated between in-force and new business, provides increased clarity for this segment as the vast majority of the costs to generate new business in this segment are not deferrable and Adjusted EBIT will fluctuate based on management's decisions on how much marketing costs to incur in each period.  Adjusted EBIT from new business includes pre-tax revenues and expenses associated with new sales of our insurance products during the first year after the sale is completed.  Adjusted EBIT from in-force business includes all pre-tax revenues and expenses associated with sales of insurance products that were completed more than one year before the end of the reporting period.  The allocation of certain revenues and expenses between new and in-force business is based on estimates, which we believe are reasonable.

Recognizing the accounting standard that requires us to expense certain direct response advertising costs (rather than deferring such costs as deferred acquisition costs), the amount of our investment in new business in the Colonial Penn segment during a particular period will have a significant impact on the segment results.  The following summarizes our earnings, separated between in-force and new business for Colonial Penn (dollars in millions): 

The   Adjusted EBIT from in-force business in the Colonial Penn segment   in the third quarter of 2016 reflects higher mortality and expenses as compared to the same period in 2015.  The   Adjusted EBIT from new business in the Colonial Penn segment   in the 2016 periods primarily reflects higher marketing costs.  The vast majority of the costs to generate new business in this segment are not deferrable and Adjusted EBIT will fluctuate based on management's decisions on how much marketing costs to incur in each period.

Corporate Operations (dollars in millions) 

Interest expense on corporate debt   has been primarily impacted by the debt refinancing transactions completed in May 2015, along with the mix of interest rates on the related outstanding borrowings.  Our average corporate debt outstanding was $925.0 million and $878.2 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The average interest rate on our debt was 4.7 percent in both the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The 2016 periods also reflect lower amortization of discount and issuance costs primarily due to the extended maturity profile of the debt incurred in our debt refinancing transactions. 
    
  Net investment income on general investment portfolio   fluctuates based on the amount and type of invested assets in the corporate operations segment. 
    
  Net investment income on other special-purpose portfolios   includes the income (loss) from:  (i) investments related to deferred compensation plans held in a rabbi trust (which is offset by amounts included in   other operating costs and expenses   as the investment results are allocated to participants' account balances); (ii) trading account activities; and (iii) income (loss) from Company-owned life insurance ("COLI") equal to the difference between the return on these investments  (representing the  
  
    77 

CNO FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  ___________________ 

change in value of the underlying investments) and our overall portfolio yield.  COLI is utilized as an investment vehicle to fund Bankers Life's agent deferred compensation plan.  For segment reporting, the Bankers Life segment is allocated a return on these investments equivalent to the yield on the Company s overall portfolio, with any difference in the actual COLI return allocated to the Corporate operations segment.  
    
  Fee revenue and other income   includes the fees our wholly-owned investment advisor earns for managing portfolios of commercial bank loans for investment trusts.  These trusts are consolidated as VIEs in our consolidated financial statements, but the fees are reflected as revenues and the fee expense is reflected in the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.  This fee revenue fluctuates consistent with the size of the loan portfolios. 
    
  Other operating costs and expenses   include general corporate expenses, net of amounts charged to subsidiaries for services provided by the corporate operations.  These amounts fluctuate as a result of expenses such as investments in our business which are not permitted to be capitalized including consulting costs and costs incurred related to corporate development activities.  These costs were higher in the 2016 periods.  Other operating costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2016 included $3 million of accelerated stock compensation expense related to retirement eligible employees.  Since certain stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement eligible employees do not require the employee to provide any further service to retain the award, 100 percent of the compensation expense was recognized when the awards were granted in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Net realized investment gains (losses)   often fluctuate each period.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , net realized investment losses in this segment were $3.0 million and were comprised of: (i) $5.5 million of net gains from the sales of investments (including $12.1 million of losses recognized by the VIEs and $17.6 million of net gains on other investment sales); (ii)   $7.3 million   of losses on the dissolution of a VIE; and (iii) $1.2 million of writedowns of investments held by VIEs due to other-than-temporary declines in value.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , net realized investment gains in this segment were $1.9 million and were comprised of: (i) $2.1 million of net gains from the sales of investments (including $.7 million of losses recognized by the VIEs and $2.8 million of net gains on other investment sales); (ii) a $7.9 million writedown of a legacy investment in a private company that was liquidated; (iii) $3.6 million of writedowns of investments held by VIEs due to other-than-temporary declines in value; and (iv) an $11.3 million gain on the dissolution of a VIE. 
    
  Equity in earnings of certain non-strategic investments and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests   include the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests in certain VIEs that we are required to consolidate and certain private companies that were acquired in the commutation of an investment made by our Predecessor, net of affiliated amounts.  Such earnings are not indicative and are unrelated to the Company's underlying fundamentals. 
    
  Transition expenses   include one-time expenses associated with our comprehensive agreement with Cognizant for our application development, maintenance and testing functions as well as select information technology infrastructure operations.  Transition expenses were   $9.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Net revenue (expense) pursuant to transition and support services agreements   represents the difference between the fees we receive from Wilton Reassurance Company and the overhead costs incurred to provide such services under the agreements subsequent to the sale of Conseco Life Insurance Company. 
    
  Fair value changes and amendment related to agent deferred compensation plan   relate to: (i) changes in the underlying actuarial assumptions used to value liabilities for our agent deferred compensation plan; and (ii) an amendment made to the plan in the third quarter of 2016.  The agent deferred compensation plan was amended to: (i) freeze participation in the plan; (ii) freeze benefits accrued under the plan; and (iii) add a limited cashout feature.  During the third quarter of 2016, we made lump sum settlement distributions to plan participants with account balances that were below a certain threshold consistent with the provision of the amended plan.  We recognized a pre-tax gain of $6.3 million related to the settlement distributions in the third quarter of 2016.  The change in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , reflects: (i) the aforementioned impact of the amendment; and (ii) a 50 basis point reduction in the interest rate used to determine these liabilities, consistent with the decrease in market interest rates. 
    
  Loss on reinsurance transaction   of $75.4 million resulted from the termination of the reinsurance agreements with BRe and recapture of the ceded business as further described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".

Loss on extinguishment or modification of debt   in the first   nine   months of   2015   of   $32.8 million   consisted of: (i) $15.0 million related to the write-off of unamortized discount and issuance costs due to the repayment of our previous senior secured credit agreement and 6.375% Senior Secured Notes due October 2020 (the "6.375% Notes"); and (ii) a make-whole redemption premium of $17.8 million due to the repayment of the 6.375% Notes. 

PREMIUM COLLECTIONS 
    
  In accordance with GAAP, insurance policy income in our consolidated statement of operations consists of premiums earned for traditional insurance policies that have life contingencies or morbidity features.  For annuity and interest-sensitive life contracts, premiums collected are not reported as revenues, but as deposits to insurance liabilities.  We recognize revenues for these products over time in the form of investment income and surrender or other charges. 
    
  Our insurance segments sell products through three primary distribution channels - career agents (our Bankers Life segment), direct marketing (our Colonial Penn segment) and independent producers (our Washington National segment).  Our career agency force in the Bankers Life segment sells primarily Medicare supplement and long-term care insurance policies, life insurance and annuities.  These agents visit the customer's home, which permits one-on-one contact with potential policyholders and promotes strong personal relationships with existing policyholders.  Our direct marketing distribution channel in the Colonial Penn segment is engaged primarily in the sale of graded benefit life and simplified issue life insurance policies which are sold directly to the policyholder.  Our Washington National segment sells primarily supplemental health and life insurance.  These products are marketed through PMA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that specializes in marketing and distributing health products, and through independent marketing organizations and insurance agencies, including worksite marketing. 
    
  Agents, insurance brokers and marketing companies who market our products and prospective purchasers of our products use the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries as an important factor in determining whether to market or purchase.  Ratings have the most impact on our sales of supplemental health and life products to consumers at the worksite.  The current financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries from S P, Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), A.M. Best and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's") are "BBB+", "BBB+", "A-" and "Baa1",    respectively.  For a description of these ratings and additional information on our ratings, see "Financial Strength Ratings of our Insurance Subsidiaries". 
    
  We set premium rates on our health insurance policies based on facts and circumstances known at the time we issue the policies using assumptions about numerous variables, including the actuarial probability of a policyholder incurring a claim, the probable size of the claim, and the interest rate earned on our investment of premiums.  We also consider historical claims information, industry statistics, the rates of our competitors and other factors.  If our actual claims experience is less favorable than we anticipated and we are unable to raise our premium rates, our financial results may be adversely affected.  We generally cannot raise our health insurance premiums in any state until we obtain the approval of the state insurance regulator.  We review the adequacy of our premium rates regularly and file for rate increases on our products when we believe such rates are too low.  It is likely that we will not be able to obtain approval for all requested premium rate increases.  If such requests are denied in one or more states, our net income may decrease.  If such requests are approved, increased premium rates may reduce the volume of our new sales and may cause existing policyholders to lapse their policies.  If the healthier policyholders allow their policies to lapse, this would reduce our premium income and profitability in the future.

           (a) 
    This non-GAAP measure differs from the corresponding GAAP measure presented immediately above, because accumulated other comprehensive income has been excluded from the value of capital used to determine this measure.  Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful because it removes the volatility that arises from changes in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Such volatility is often caused by changes in the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio resulting from changes in general market interest rates rather than the business decisions made by management.  However, this measure does not replace the corresponding GAAP measure. 
       
  Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off 
    
  In December 2013, two of our insurance subsidiaries with long-term care business (Washington National and BCLIC) entered into 100% coinsurance agreements ceding $495 million of long-term care reserves to BRe.  Pursuant to the agreements, the Company paid an additional premium of $96.9 million to BRe and an amount equal to the related net liabilities.  BRe is a reinsurer that is not licensed or accredited by the states of domicile (Indiana and New York, respectively) of the insurance subsidiaries ceding the long-term care business and BRe is not rated by A.M. Best.  As a result of its non-accredited status, BRe was required to provide collateral which meets the regulatory requirements of the states of domicile in order for our insurance subsidiaries to obtain full credit in their statutory financial statements for the reinsurance receivables due from BRe.  Such collateral was required to be held in market value trusts subject to 7% over collateralization, investment guidelines and periodic true-up provisions. 
    
  Certain irregularities had come to our attention regarding BRe, including its relationship with Platinum and the valuation and appropriateness of the collateral deposited in trusts by BRe for Washington National and BCLIC.  CNO commenced an  
  
    84 

CNO FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  ___________________ 

independent third-party audit by a forensic accounting firm in late June 2016 of certain investments deposited in the trusts by BRe.  Such investments included assets valued at that time using unobservable inputs that contain assumptions determined by BRe.  The initial scope of CNO s audit was a subset of investments which had an estimated fair value of approximately $62 million as of September 30, 2016.  The independent audit of these investments was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2016.  The information currently available to CNO confirms that a significant portion of these assets bear some connection to Platinum or to parties that have had past or present associations with Platinum.  CNO has serious concerns regarding BRe s conflicts of interest and whether, in many cases, the assets related to Platinum were acquired in appropriate arm s-length transactions. 
    
  Moreover, CNO and the auditor retained by CNO also have concluded that many of the values assigned to these investments by BRe and summarized in reports prepared by its valuation firm, Duff   Phelps, were inaccurate due to the use of flawed methodologies.  Based on the information available to us at this time, we are comfortable that our estimated fair values for these investments are reasonable.  We believe our estimated values recognize the inherent volatility and default probability given the nature of these investments and specific ownership related issues. 
    
  In September 2016, BCLIC and Washington National expanded the scope of the independent audit to include additional investments for which we estimated the fair value to be approximately $63 million as of September 30, 2016.  Based on our initial assessment, these additional investments do not have connections to Platinum or to parties that have had past or present associations with Platinum.  Based on the information currently available, these assets appear to be less complex, more diversified, and less difficult to value.  However, we chose to expand the scope of the original audit primarily to independently confirm our internal assessment.  While no assurances can be given, we anticipate that the audit of these additional investments will be completed, to the extent possible given the availability of information, by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.  However, we have not discovered any information that would lead us to conclude our initial assessment was incorrect. 
    
  We have greater confidence in the reasonableness of our valuation inputs with respect to the investments that we do not intend to include as part of the independent third party audit.  While these investments may be subject to normal market value fluctuations, concerns related to ownership structure and the probability of default are generally lower than the investments included in the audit. 
    
  On September 29, 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services (the "NYDFS") issued a regulatory demand letter to CNO.  In the letter, the NYDFS said it had conducted a "detailed analysis" of the assets in the primary BCLIC trust account, after which it had "concluded that a substantial portion of the current assets held within the Trust are not in compliance with the standards set under 11 NYCRR   126 (Insurance Regulation 114)."  The NYDFS also said that "[a]ssets within the trust were removed subsequent to the Department s approval of the reinsurance treaty and replaced with assets that do not comply with 11 NYCRR   126(a)(2), which states that  assets deposited in the trust account shall be valued according to their current fair market value, and shall consist only of cash (United States legal tender), certificates of deposit (issued by a United States bank and payable in United States legal tender), and investments of the types specified in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (8) and (10) of subsection (a) of section 1404 of the New York Insurance Law.'"  The NYDFS directed BCLIC "to remediate this deficiency within ten days of the date of this letter [i.e., by October 9, 2016] by ensuring the assets held within the Trust meet the requirements of Insurance Regulation 114."  The NYDFS said that "[f]ailure to bring the Trust into compliance may result in the denial of reserve credit and disciplinary action from the Department." 
    
  On September 29, 2016, the Indiana Department of Insurance ("IDOI") issued a regulatory demand letter to CNO.  In the letter, the IDOI said that the reinsurance agreement between Washington National and BRe and the related trust are not in compliance with 760 IAC 1-55-4.  The letter states that credit for reinsurance under the reinsurance agreement shall not be allowed for Washington National "unless corrective measures, satisfactory to the IDOI, are taken immediately." 
    
  On September 29, 2016, BCLIC and Washington National sent written notices to Wilmington Trust, N.A., the trustee of the BRe reinsurance trusts, pursuant to which BCLIC and Washington National notified the trustee that they are exercising their rights under the reinsurance agreements to withdraw all of the assets from the reinsurance trust accounts.  Assets included in these accounts were subsequently transferred to accounts of BCLIC and Washington National. 
    
  On September 29, 2016, BCLIC and Washington National gave written notice to BRe that they were terminating their reinsurance agreements with BRe effective immediately, after concluding that BRe s material breaches of the reinsurance agreements are incurable, and that it is in the best interests of BCLIC and Washington National policyholders and other key  
  
    85

stakeholders to terminate the reinsurance agreements.  We formed this conclusion for several reasons, including: (i) BRe represented that it would need until the end of the year to replace all of the Platinum-related assets in the trust accounts, and the NYDFS and IDOI directed BCLIC and Washington National to take corrective action relating to these assets within 10 days, in the case of the NYDFS, and immediately, in the case of the IDOI; (ii) certain statements made to CNO by BRe called into question BRe s financial ability to continue to reinsure the policies ceded to it; and (iii) BRe has, repeatedly and over the course of a prolonged period, acted in bad faith, engaged in self-dealing, and intentionally misrepresented and withheld key information about itself and its conflicts of interest from CNO. 
    
  We subsequently resumed responsibility and are in full control of all aspects of policyholder administration of the recaptured business. 
    
  Because Washington National and BCLIC have recaptured the ceded business, CNO is required to value the investments at their estimated fair value as of the date of recapture.  In addition, the liabilities are required to be valued based on valuation methodologies that are consistent with the methodologies used by CNO to value its insurance liabilities. 
    
  Based on the valuation methodologies used by CNO to value its insurance liabilities, this block of long-term care business is required to be evaluated separately to determine whether aggregate liabilities are deficient.  The insurance liabilities established at the recapture date include additional premium deficiency reserves of approximately $70 million.  Since this block of long-term care business is in loss recognition status, our valuation assumptions reflect no profits or losses on the block over its remaining life.  Accordingly, changes in assumptions which adversely impact future earnings will result in an immediate charge to current earnings.  This block of long-term care business will be included in our normal annual actuarial loss recognition testing review in the fourth quarter of 2016.  This block of business is particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions related to expected future investment yields.  For example, we estimate that a 50 basis point reduction in the ultimate new money rate assumption would result in a $15 million pre-tax charge. 
    
  We recognized a pre-tax loss of $75.4 million on the recapture of the long-term care business as summarized below (dollars in millions): 

The assets included in the aforementioned independent audits are summarized below by investment type (dollars in millions): 

As a result of the recapture, related charge and additional capital required to support the assets and liabilities of this business, CNO contributed $200 million to its insurance subsidiaries on September 30, 2016.  After giving effect to this

contribution, CNO has $189 million of cash and investments at the holding company as of September 30, 2016 and its consolidated RBC ratio was estimated to be 458%. 
  The impact of the recapture on our statutory earnings and surplus at September 30, 2016 is summarized below (dollars in millions): 

In order to increase its excess capital position, CNO has suspended its share repurchase program for the remainder of 2016.  
    
  Liquidity for Insurance Operations 
    
  Our insurance companies generally receive adequate cash flows from premium collections and investment income to meet their obligations.  Life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity liabilities are generally long-term in nature.  Life and annuity policyholders may, however, withdraw funds or surrender their policies, subject to any applicable penalty provisions; there are generally no withdrawal or surrender benefits for long-term care insurance.  We actively manage the relationship between the duration of our invested assets and the estimated duration of benefit payments arising from contract liabilities. 
    
  Three of the Company's insurance subsidiaries (Washington National, Bankers Life and Colonial Penn) are members of the FHLB.  As members of the FHLB, our insurance subsidiaries have the ability to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLB.  We are required to hold certain minimum amounts of FHLB common stock as a condition of membership in the FHLB, and additional amounts based on the amount of the borrowings.  At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the FHLB common stock was   $71.2 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , collateralized borrowings from the FHLB totaled   $1.6 billion   and the proceeds were used to purchase fixed maturity securities.  The borrowings are classified as investment borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The borrowings are collateralized by investments with an estimated fair value of   $2.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , which are maintained in custodial accounts for the benefit of the FHLB.

The following summarizes the terms of the borrowings from the FHLB by our insurance subsidiaries (dollars in millions): 

State laws generally give state insurance regulatory agencies broad authority to protect policyholders in their jurisdictions.  Regulators have used this authority in the past to restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay any dividends or other amounts without prior approval.  We cannot be assured that the regulators will not seek to assert greater supervision and control over our insurance subsidiaries' businesses and financial affairs. 
    
  Our estimated consolidated statutory RBC ratio of   458 percent   at   September 30, 2016  , reflects estimated consolidated statutory operating earnings of $162 million (including approximately $110 million loss on the recapture of long-term care business), a $200.0 million capital contribution to the insurance subsidiaries from the holding company (related to the charge and additional capital required to support the recapture of the long-term care business) and dividends to the holding company of

$175.8 million during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  Statutory earnings will often fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the application of statutory accounting principles. 
    
  Our insurance subsidiaries transfer exposure to certain risk to others through reinsurance arrangements.  When we obtain reinsurance, we are still liable for those transferred risks in the event the reinsurer defaults on its obligations.  The failure, insolvency, inability or unwillingness of one or more of the Company's reinsurers to perform in accordance with the terms of its reinsurance agreement could negatively impact our earnings or financial position and our consolidated statutory RBC ratio. 
    
  Financial Strength Ratings of our Insurance Subsidiaries 
    
  Financial strength ratings provided by S P, Fitch, A.M. Best and Moody's are the rating agency's opinions of the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay policyholder claims and obligations when due. 
    
  On October 4, 2016, S P affirmed the financial strength ratings of "BBB+" of our primary insurance subsidiaries.  The outlook for these ratings is negative and S P removed them from Credit Watch.  S P s recent actions reflect information related to one of the Company s reinsurers and the Company's recapture of the ceded business as further described above under the caption "Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".  S P financial strength ratings range from "AAA" to "R" and some companies are not rated.  An insurer rated "BBB" or higher is regarded as having financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities, and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments.  An insurer rated "BBB", in S P's opinion, has good financial security characteristics, but is more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are higher-rated insurers.  Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category.  S P has twenty-one possible ratings.  There are seven ratings above the "BBB+" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and thirteen ratings that are below that rating. 
    
  On August 3, 2016, Fitch placed its "BBB+" financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries on Rating Watch Negative.  Fitch s recent actions reflect information related to one of the Company s reinsurers and the Company's recapture of the ceded business as further described above under the caption "Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".  A "BBB" rating, in Fitch's opinion, indicates that there is currently a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments.  The capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations on a timely basis is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances and economic conditions are more likely to impact this capacity.  Fitch ratings for the industry range from "AAA Exceptionally Strong" to "C Distressed" and some companies are not rated.  Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category.  Fitch has nineteen possible ratings.  There are seven ratings above the "BBB+" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and eleven ratings that are below that rating. 
    
  On August 26, 2015, A.M. Best upgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries to "A-" from "B++" and the outlook for these ratings is stable.  The "A-" rating is assigned to companies that have an excellent ability, in A.M. Best's opinion, to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders.  A.M. Best ratings for the industry currently range from "A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)" and some companies are not rated.  An "A++" rating indicates a superior ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders.  A.M. Best has sixteen possible ratings.  There are three ratings above the "A-" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and twelve ratings that are below that rating. 
    
  On May 11, 2015, Moody's upgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries to "Baa1" from "Baa2" and the outlook for these ratings is stable.  Moody s financial strength ratings range from "Aaa" to "C".  These ratings may be supplemented with numbers "1", "2", or "3" to show relative standing within a category.  In Moody's view, an insurer rated "Baa" offers adequate financial security, however, certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time.  Moody's has twenty-one possible ratings.  There are seven ratings above the "Baa1" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and thirteen ratings that are below that rating. 
    
  Rating agencies have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews and requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including us.  They may also adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.  We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response.  Accordingly, downgrades and outlook revisions related to us or the life insurance industry may occur in the future at any time and without notice by any rating agency.  These could increase policy surrenders

  Liquidity of the Holding Companies 
    
  Availability and Sources and Uses of Holding Company Liquidity; Limitations on Ability of Insurance Subsidiaries to Make Dividend and Surplus Debenture Interest Payments to the Holding Companies; Limitations on Holding Company Activities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , CNO, CDOC, Inc. ("CDOC", our wholly owned subsidiary and the immediate parent of Washington National and Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas ("CLTX")) and our other non-insurance subsidiaries held:  (i) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $158.4 million; (ii) fixed income investments of $16.8 million; and (iii) equity securities of $14.1 million.  CNO and CDOC are holding companies with no business operations of their own; they depend on their operating subsidiaries for cash to make principal and interest payments on debt, and to pay administrative expenses and income taxes.  CNO and CDOC receive cash from insurance subsidiaries, consisting of dividends and distributions, interest payments on surplus debentures and tax-sharing payments, as well as cash from non-insurance subsidiaries consisting of dividends, distributions, loans and advances.  The principal non-insurance subsidiaries that provide cash to CNO and CDOC are 40|86 Advisors, Inc. ("40|86 Advisors"), which receives fees from the insurance subsidiaries for investment services, and CNO Services, LLC which receives fees from the insurance subsidiaries for providing administrative services.  The agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and CNO Services, LLC and 40|86 Advisors, respectively, were previously approved by the domestic insurance regulator for each insurance company, and any payments thereunder do not require further regulatory approval. 
    
  The following summarizes the current ownership structure of CNO s primary subsidiaries: 

The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to state insurance department regulations and is based on the financial statements of our insurance subsidiaries prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities, which differ from GAAP.  These regulations generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory earned surplus of the insurance company for any 12-month period in amounts equal to the greater of (or in a few states, the lesser of):  (i) statutory net gain from operations or net income for the prior year; or (ii) 10 percent of statutory capital and surplus as of the end of the preceding year.  This type of dividend is referred to as an "ordinary dividend".  Any dividend in excess of these levels or from an insurance company that has negative earned surplus requires the approval of the director or commissioner of the applicable state insurance department and is referred to as an "extraordinary dividend".  Each of the direct insurance subsidiaries of CDOC has significant negative earned surplus and any dividend payments from the direct insurance subsidiaries of CDOC would be considered extraordinary dividends and, therefore, require the approval of the director or commissioner of the applicable state insurance department.  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , our insurance subsidiaries paid extraordinary dividends to CDOC totaling $175.8 million.  We expect to receive regulatory approval for future dividends from our subsidiaries, but there can be no assurance that such payments will be approved or that the financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries will not change, making future approvals less likely. 
    
  CDOC holds surplus debentures from CLTX with an aggregate principal amount of $749.6 million.  Interest payments on those surplus debentures do not require additional approval provided the RBC ratio of CLTX exceeds 100 percent (but do  
  
    90 

CNO FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  ___________________ 

require prior written notice to the Texas state insurance department).  The estimated RBC ratio of CLTX was 395 percent at   September 30, 2016  .  CDOC also holds a surplus debenture from Colonial Penn with a principal balance of $160.0 million.  Interest payments on that surplus debenture require prior approval by the Pennsylvania state insurance department.  Dividends and other payments from our non-insurance subsidiaries, including 40|86 Advisors and CNO Services, LLC, to CNO or CDOC do not require approval by any regulatory authority or other third party.  However, insurance regulators may prohibit payments by our insurance subsidiaries to parent companies if they determine that such payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. 
    
  The insurance subsidiaries of CDOC receive funds to pay dividends primarily from:  (i) the earnings of their direct businesses; (ii) tax sharing payments received from subsidiaries (if applicable); and (iii) with respect to CLTX, dividends received from subsidiaries.  At   September 30, 2016  , the subsidiaries of CLTX had earned surplus (deficit) as summarized below (dollars in millions):

    Bankers Life paid ordinary dividends of $90 million to CLTX in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
              (b) 
    The deficit is primarily due to transactions which occurred several years ago, including a tax planning transaction and the fee paid to recapture a block of business previously ceded to an unaffiliated insurer. 
       
  A significant deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of the material subsidiaries of CNO or CDOC for any reason could hinder such subsidiaries' ability to pay cash dividends or other disbursements to CNO and/or CDOC, which, in turn, could limit CNO's ability to meet debt service requirements and satisfy other financial obligations.  In addition, we may choose to retain capital in our insurance subsidiaries or to contribute additional capital to our insurance subsidiaries to strengthen their surplus, and these decisions could limit the amount available at our top tier insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding companies.  As further described above under the caption "Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off", CDOC made $200.0 million of capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries on   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased   11.7 million   shares of common stock for   $203.0 million   under our securities repurchase program.  The Company has remaining repurchase authority of   $252.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  As described above under the caption "Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off", we suspended our share repurchase program for the remainder of 2016 in order to increase our excess capital. 
    
  We have previously disclosed that our strategic priorities include a reduction of our relative long-term care exposure by approximately one-half over the next three to six years.  To achieve this goal, it is likely that we will need to transfer the risks of a portion of this business through one or more reinsurance transactions.  A substantial ceding commission could be paid by the Company to transfer long-term care risk through reinsurance, depending on the specific types of risks and amounts ceded.  The payment of a ceding commission by the Company would likely result in the recognition of a loss upon the completion of a reinsurance transaction.  Due to our current tax position, it is likely that a portion of the tax benefit recognized on the loss would not be realized and we may be required to increase our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.  Although we believe reducing our exposure to the risk of long-term care business through reinsurance would benefit the Company in the long term, such a transaction could initially adversely impact certain aspects of our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow, including the cash available to repurchase shares of our common stock. 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , dividends declared on common stock totaled   $40.8 million   (  $0.23   per common share).   In May 2016, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend to   $0.08   per share from   $0.07   per share. 
    
  On October 4, 2016, S P affirmed our issuer credit and secured debt ratings of "BB+".  The outlook for these ratings is negative and S P removed them from Credit Watch.  S P s recent actions reflect information related to one of the Company s

reinsurers and the Company's recapture of the ceded business as further described above under the caption "Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".  In S P's view, an obligation rated "BB" is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues.  However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category.  S P has a total of 22 possible ratings ranging from "AAA (Extremely Strong)" to "D (Payment Default)".  There are ten ratings above CNO's "BB+" rating and eleven ratings that are below its rating. 
    
  On August 3, 2016, Fitch placed its  BB+  rating on our issuer credit and senior secured debt on Rating Watch Negative.   Fitch s recent actions reflect information related to one of the Company s reinsurers and the Company's recapture of the ceded business as further described above under the caption "Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".  In Fitch's view, an obligation rated "BB" indicates an elevated vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists which supports the servicing of financial commitments.  Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category.  Fitch has a total of 21 possible ratings ranging from "AAA" to "D".  There are ten ratings above CNO's "BB+" rating and ten ratings that are below its rating. 
    
  On August 26, 2015, A.M. Best upgraded our issuer credit and senior secured debt ratings to "bbb-" from "bb+" and the outlook for these ratings is stable.  In A.M. Best's view, a company rated "bbb-" has an adequate ability to meet the terms of its obligations; however, the issuer is more susceptible to changes in economic or other conditions.  Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category.  A.M. Best has a total of 22 possible ratings ranging from "aaa (Exceptional)" to "d (In default)".  There are nine ratings above CNO's "bbb-" rating and twelve ratings that are below its rating. 
    
  On May 11, 2015, Moody's upgraded our issuer credit and senior secured debt ratings to "Ba1" from "Ba2" and the outlook for these ratings is stable.  In Moody's view, obligations rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk.  A rating is supplemented with numerical modifiers "1", "2" or "3" to show the relative standing within a category.  Moody's has a total of 21 possible ratings ranging from "Aaa" to "C".  There are ten ratings above CNO's "Ba1" rating and ten ratings that are below its rating. 
    
  As part of our investment strategy, we may enter into repurchase agreements to increase our investment return.  Pursuant to such agreements, the Company sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same securities.  Under these arrangements, the Company may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase the assets.  As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities.  No such borrowings were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  We believe that the existing cash available to the holding company, the cash flows to be generated from operations and other transactions will be sufficient to allow us to meet our debt service obligations, pay corporate expenses and satisfy other financial obligations.  However, our cash flow is affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including insurance regulatory issues, competition, financial markets and other general business conditions.  We cannot provide assurance that we will possess sufficient income and liquidity to meet all of our debt service requirements and other holding company obligations.

    Investment ratings   Investment ratings are assigned the second lowest rating by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSROs") (Moody's, S P or Fitch), or if not rated by such firms, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC").  NAIC designations of "1" or "2" include fixed maturities generally rated investment grade (rated "Baa3" or higher by Moody's or rated "BBB-" or higher by S P and Fitch).  NAIC designations of "3" through "6" are referred to as below-investment grade (which generally are rated "Ba1" or lower by Moody's or rated "BB+" or lower by S P and Fitch).  References to investment grade or below-investment grade throughout our consolidated financial statements are determined as described above.

The NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity investments of insurers for regulatory and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called NAIC designations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements based on statutory accounting principles.  The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of the NRSROs for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities.  However, certain structured securities rated below investment grade by the NRSROs can be assigned NAIC 1 or NAIC 2 designations dependent on the cost basis of the holding relative to estimated recoverable amounts as determined by the NAIC.

At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity securities in the energy sector was   $1.6 billion  , with gross unrealized gains of $143.1 million and gross unrealized losses of   $28.7 million  .  Although these securities are of high quality (88 percent are rated investment grade) and diversified (76 issuers), we could be exposed to future downgrades and declines in market values if oil prices remain at low levels for an extended period of time.  At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our fixed maturity securities in the energy sector was $1.5 billion, with gross unrealized gains of $59.4 million and gross unrealized losses of $160.9 million.   
    
  Below-Investment Grade Securities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of the Company's below-investment grade fixed maturity securities was   $3,069.5 million  , or   16 percent   of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio.  The estimated fair value of the below-investment grade portfolio was   $3,155.0 million  , or   103 percent   of the amortized cost (refer to the table on page 93 for composition of the below-investment grade portfolio). 
    
  Below-investment grade corporate debt securities typically have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities.  Based on historical performance, probability of default by the borrower is significantly greater for below-

investment grade corporate debt securities and in many cases severity of loss is relatively greater as such securities are generally unsecured and often subordinated to other indebtedness of the issuer.  Also, issuers of below-investment grade corporate debt securities frequently have higher levels of debt relative to investment-grade issuers, hence, all other things being equal, are generally more sensitive to adverse economic conditions.  The Company attempts to reduce the overall risk related to its investment in below-investment grade securities, as in all investments, through careful credit analysis, strict investment policy guidelines, and diversification by issuer and/or guarantor and by industry. 
    
  Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) 
    
  The following table sets forth the net realized investment gains (losses) for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): 

_________________ 
           (a) 
    Changes in the estimated fair value of trading securities that we have elected the fair value option (and are still held as of the end of the respective periods) was   $.8 million   and   $(4.7) million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized net realized investment gains of   $23.3 million  , which were comprised of: (i)   $48.1 million   of net gains from the sales of investments; (ii) a   $7.3 million   loss on the dissolution of a VIE; (iii) the increase in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of   $.6 million  ; (iv) the increase in fair value of embedded derivatives related to a modified coinsurance agreement of   $6.7 million  ; and (v)   $24.8 million   of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income.  
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we recognized net realized investment losses of   $20.8 million  , which were comprised of: (i)   $1.5 million   of net losses from the sales of investments; (ii) an   $11.3 million   gain on the dissolution of a VIE; (iii) the decrease in fair value of certain fixed maturity investments with embedded derivatives of   $4.7 million  ; (iv) the decrease in fair value of embedded derivatives related to a modified coinsurance agreement of   $4.3 million  ; and (v)   $21.6 million   of writedowns of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value recognized through net income (  $24.6 million  , prior to the   $3.0 million   of impairment losses recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income). 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   two   investments in default or considered nonperforming with both an amortized cost and carrying value of $3.8 million.

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the   $84.4 million   of gross realized losses on sales of   $477.2 million   of fixed maturity securities, available for sale, included: (i)   $77.8 million   related to various corporate securities (including   $62.7 million   related to sales of investments in the energy sector); (ii)   $5.3 million   related to commercial mortgage-backed securities; and (iii)   $1.3 million   related to various other investments.  Securities are generally sold at a loss following unforeseen issue-specific events or conditions or shifts in perceived risks.  These reasons include but are not limited to:  (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectation that the market value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce our exposure to an asset class, an issuer or an industry; (iv) prospective or actual changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected portfolio cash flows. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , the   $48.7 million   of gross realized losses on sales of   $416.7 million   of fixed maturity securities, available for sale, included:  (i) $47.9 million related to various corporate securities (including $29.3 million related to sales of investments in the energy sector); and (ii) $.8 million of losses related to the sales of asset-backed securities. 
    
  Our fixed maturity investments are generally purchased in the context of various long-term strategies, including funding insurance liabilities, so we do not generally seek to generate short-term realized gains through the purchase and sale of such securities.  In certain circumstances, including those in which securities are selling at prices which exceed our view of their underlying economic value, or when it is possible to reinvest the proceeds to better meet our long-term asset-liability objectives, we may sell certain securities. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized   $24.8 million   of impairment losses recorded in earnings which included: (i)   $6.3 million   of writedowns on fixed maturities of a single issuer in the energy sector; (ii)   $3.7 million   of writedowns on a direct loan due to borrower specific events; (iii)   $12.7 million   of writedowns on a privately placed preferred stock of an entity formed to construct and operate a chemical plant; (iv)   $.9 million   of writedowns related to a real estate investment; and (v)   $1.2 million   of writedowns of investments held by VIEs due to other-than-temporary declines in value. Factors considered in determining the writedowns of investments in the first   nine   months of   2016   included the subordination status of each investment, the impact of recent downgrades and issuer specific events, including the impact of the current low oil prices on issuers in the energy sector. 
    
  The following summarizes the investments sold at a loss during the first   nine   months of   2016   which had been continuously in an unrealized loss position exceeding 20 percent of the amortized cost basis prior to the sale for the period indicated (dollars in millions): 

We regularly evaluate all of our investments with unrealized losses for possible impairment.  Our assessment of whether unrealized losses are "other than temporary" requires significant judgment.  Factors considered include:  (i) the extent to which fair value is less than the cost basis; (ii) the length of time that the fair value has been less than cost; (iii) whether the unrealized loss is event driven, credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates or risk premium; (iv) the near-term prospects for specific events, developments or circumstances likely to affect the value of the investment; (v) the investment's rating and whether the investment is investment-grade and/or has been downgraded since its purchase; (vi) whether the issuer is current on all payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the investment and is expected to meet all of its obligations under the terms of the investment; (vii) whether we intend to sell the investment or it is more likely than not that circumstances will require us to sell the investment before recovery occurs; (viii) the underlying current and prospective asset and enterprise values of the issuer and the extent to which the recoverability of the carrying value of our investment may be affected by changes in such values; (ix) projections of, and unfavorable changes in, cash flows on structured securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; (x) our best estimate of the value of any collateral; and (xi) other objective and subjective factors.

Future events may occur, or additional information may become available, which may necessitate future realized losses in our portfolio.  Significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 
    
  The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of those fixed maturities, available for sale, with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity.  Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties.  Structured securities frequently include provisions for periodic principal payments and permit periodic unscheduled payments.

The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed maturity securities, available for sale, by category and ratings category as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions): 

Our investment strategy is to maximize, over a sustained period and within acceptable parameters of quality and risk, investment income and total investment return through active investment management.  Accordingly, we may sell securities at a gain or a loss to enhance the projected total return of the portfolio as market opportunities change, to reflect changing perceptions of risk, or to better match certain characteristics of our investment portfolio with the corresponding characteristics of our insurance liabilities.

The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses and fair values of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that such securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions): 

Based on management's current assessment of investments with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes the issuers of the securities will continue to meet their obligations (or with respect to equity-type securities, the investment value will recover to its cost basis).  While we do not have the intent to sell securities with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities with unrealized losses prior to their anticipated recovery, our intent on an individual security may change, based upon market or other unforeseen developments.  In such instances, if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date due to these unexpected developments, the loss is recognized in the period in which we had the intent to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. 
    
  Structured Securities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   fixed maturity investments included structured securities with an estimated fair value of   $5.5 billion   (or   25 percent   of all fixed maturity securities).  The yield characteristics of structured securities generally differ in some respects from those of traditional corporate fixed-income securities or government securities.  For example, interest and principal payments on structured securities may occur more frequently, often monthly.  In many instances, we are subject to variability in the amount and timing of principal and interest payments.  For example, in many cases, partial prepayments may occur at the option of the issuer and prepayment rates are influenced by a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty, including:  the relative sensitivity of prepayments on the underlying assets backing the security to changes in interest rates and asset values; the availability of alternative financing; a variety of economic, geographic and other factors; the timing, pace and proceeds of liquidations of defaulted collateral; and various security-specific structural considerations (for example, the repayment priority of a given security in a securitization structure).  In addition, the total amount of payments for non-agency structured securities may be affected by changes to cumulative default rates or loss severities of the related collateral.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of structured securities at   September 30, 2016  , summarized by type of security, were as follows (dollars in millions): 

Pass-throughs, sequentials and equivalent securities have unique prepayment variability characteristics.  Pass-through securities typically return principal to the holders based on cash payments from the underlying mortgage obligations.  Sequential securities return principal to tranche holders in a detailed hierarchy.  Planned amortization classes, targeted amortization classes and accretion-directed bonds adhere to fixed schedules of principal payments as long as the underlying mortgage loans experience prepayments within certain estimated ranges.  In most circumstances, changes in prepayment rates are first absorbed by support or companion classes insulating the timing of receipt of cash flows from the consequences of both faster prepayments (average life shortening) and slower prepayments (average life extension). 
    
  Commercial mortgage-backed securities are secured by commercial real estate mortgages, generally income producing properties that are managed for profit.  Property types include multi-family dwellings including apartments, retail centers, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, nursing homes, warehouses, and office buildings.  While most commercial mortgage-backed securities have call protection features whereby underlying borrowers may not prepay their mortgages for stated periods of time without incurring prepayment penalties, recoveries on defaulted collateral may result in involuntary prepayments.

OTHER MATTERS 
    
  Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
    
  In April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor ("DOL") issued a final regulation that expands the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Code.  The DOL also issued a new "best interest contract" prohibited transaction exemption regarding how such advice can be provided to retirement investors.  These regulations focus in large part on conflicts of interest related to investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, insurance agents and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors.  These regulations will impact primarily our Bankers Life segment.  Implementation of these new regulations will be phased in beginning in April 2017 with the regulations in full effect by January 1, 2018.  CNO and its advisors have spent considerable time analyzing the potential effect of the regulations on our business and identifying actions to be taken in order to comply with the regulations.  We have determined that we will utilize the best interest contract exemption.  Transaction compensation will continue to be paid for covered products and additional compensation impacts are currently under review.  We currently expect the implementation expenses associated with the DOL regulations to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million in 2017, with annual expenses thereafter expected to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million.   
  The NAIC has developed a principle-based reserving approach which will replace the current formulaic approach to determining policy reserves with an approach that more closely reflects the risks of the products.  The principle-based approach will become effective on January 1, 2017, and there is a three-year transition period where the approach is optional until it is required to be applied.  The new approach will impact the financial statements of our insurance subsidiaries prepared under statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities.  Certain states, such as New York, have not yet adopted the new approach.  The Company is reviewing the application of the new approach to its reserves.

  Our market risks, and the ways we manage them, are summarized in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes in the first   nine   months of   2016   to such risks or our management of such risks. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .  CNO's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of CNO's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  Based on its evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , CNO's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by CNO in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.    There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
    
  Information required for Part II, Item 1 is incorporated by reference to the discussion under the heading "Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings" in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. 
    
  CNO and its businesses are subject to a number of risks including general business and financial risk factors.  Any or all of such factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of CNO.  Refer to "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for further discussion of such risk factors.  There have been no material changes from such previously disclosed risk factors, except as set forth below: 
    
  We face risk with respect to our reinsurance agreements. 
    
  We transfer exposure to certain risks to others through reinsurance arrangements.  Under these arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and expenses associated with reported and unreported claims in exchange for a portion of policy premiums.  The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on general market conditions and may vary significantly.  As of December 31, 2015, our reinsurance receivables and ceded life insurance in-force totaled $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.  Our six largest reinsurers accounted for 93 percent of our ceded life insurance in-force.  We face credit risk with respect to reinsurance.  When we obtain reinsurance, we are still liable for those transferred risks in the event the reinsurer defaults on its obligations.  The failure, insolvency, inability or unwillingness of one or more of the Company's reinsurers to perform in accordance with the terms of its reinsurance agreement could negatively impact our earnings or financial position.  
    
  In December 2013, two of our insurance subsidiaries with long-term care business (Washington National and BCLIC) entered into 100% coinsurance agreements ceding $495 million of long-term care reserves to BRe.  Pursuant to the agreements, the Company paid an additional premium of $96.9 million to BRe and an amount equal to the related net liabilities.  BRe is a reinsurer that is not licensed or accredited by the states of domicile (Indiana and New York, respectively) of the insurance subsidiaries ceding the long-term care business and BRe is not rated by A.M. Best.  As a result of its non-accredited status, BRe was required to provide collateral which meets the regulatory requirements of the states of domicile in order for our insurance subsidiaries to obtain full credit in their statutory financial statements for the reinsurance receivables due from BRe.  Such collateral was required to be held in market value trusts subject to 7% over collateralization, investment guidelines and periodic true-up provisions. 
    
  In September 2016, we terminated the reinsurance agreements with BRe and recaptured the ceded business as further described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Termination of Long-Term Care Reinsurance Agreements and Recapture of Related Long-Term Care Business in Run-off".

Exhibit 10.25 

AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
    
    This AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of the 30th day of September, 2016, is between 40|86 Advisors, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Company ), and Eric R. Johnson ( Executive ). 
       
    WHEREAS, the Company and Executive entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated December 17, 2014 and they now desire to amend and restate such agreement. 
    
  WHEREAS, the continued services of Executive and his managerial and professional experience are of value to the Company. 
    
  WHEREAS, the Company desires to have the benefit and advantage of the services of Executive to assist the Company and CNO Financial Group, Inc. ( CNO ) upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. 
    
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 
    
  1.        Employment  .  The Company hereby employs Executive and Executive hereby accepts employment upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. 
    
  2.        Term  .  The effective date of this agreement (the  Agreement ) shall be the date first written above (the  Effective Date ).  Subject to the provisions for termination as provided in Section 10 hereof, the term of Executive s employment under this Agreement shall be the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on September 30, 2019 (the  Term").  The Term shall not be automatically renewed and shall end upon any earlier termination of Executive s employment with the Company. 
    
  3.        Duties  .  During the Term, Executive shall be engaged by the Company in the capacity of President of the Company and a member of the board of directors of the Company, and he shall be an Executive Vice President of CNO, or he shall serve in such other senior executive capacity as the Chief Executive Officer of CNO shall specify.  Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of CNO or such other senior executive officer as the Chief Executive Officer of CNO may specify regarding the performance of his duties. 
    
  4.        Extent of Services  .  During the Term, subject to the direction and control of the Chief Executive Officer of CNO, Executive shall have the power and authority commensurate with his executive status and necessary to perform his duties hereunder.  Executive shall devote his entire employable time, attention and best efforts to the business of the Company and, during the Term, shall not, without the consent of the Company, be actively engaged in any other business activity, whether or not such business activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage; provided, however, that this shall not be construed as preventing Executive  

from serving on boards of professional, community, civic, education, charitable and corporate organizations on which he presently serves or may choose to serve or investing his assets in such form or manner as will not require any services on the part of Executive in the operation of the affairs of the companies in which such investments are made (to the extent not in violation of the non-solicitation provisions of Section 9 hereof); provided, however, that corporate organizations shall be limited to those mutually agreed upon by Executive and the Company. 
    
  5.        Compensation  .  During the Term: 
    
  (a)        As compensation for services hereunder rendered during the Term hereof, Executive shall receive a base salary ( Base Salary ) of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) per year payable in equal installments in accordance with the Company s payroll procedure for its salaried executives.  Salary payments and other payments under this Agreement shall be subject to withholding of taxes and other appropriate and customary amounts.  Executive may receive increases in his Base Salary from time to time, based upon his performance, subject to approval of the Company. 
    
  (b)        In addition to Base Salary, Executive will have an opportunity to earn a bonus each year, as determined by the Company, with a target annual bonus equal to 100% of Executive's Base Salary (the  Target Bonus ) and a maximum annual bonus of 200% of Executive's Base Salary with respect to any calendar year, with such bonus payable at such time that other similar payments are made to other Company executives but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year with respect to which such bonus was payable, unless the bonus amounts to be paid cannot be confirmed and paid on or before March 15, in which event the bonuses will be paid within 15 days after the bonus amounts have been confirmed by the Company.  For purposes of clarification, annual executive bonuses are payable on or before March 15 of the year following the year with respect to which such bonuses are payable, if Executive remains employed with the Company through such date or as otherwise payable under Section 11 of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, a pro-rata portion of the 2019 bonus will be paid at the same time that similar payments are made to other Company executives if Executive remains employed through the end of the Term.  The performance requirements for Target Bonuses will be based on financial and other objective targets that the CNO Board of Directors (the  Board ) or the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board (the  Compensation Committee ) believes are reasonably attainable at the time that they are set.   
    
  (c)        Executive shall be eligible to participate in and receive future grants under any CNO stock or equity-based program offered to senior executives, subject to the discretion of the Board or the Compensation Committee.

6.        Additional Benefits  .  During the Term: 
    
  (a)        Executive shall be entitled to participate in such existing executive benefit plans and insurance programs offered by the Company, or which it may adopt from time to time, for its executive management or supervisory personnel generally, in accordance with the eligibility requirements for participation therein.  Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent the Company from modifying or terminating any executive benefit plans or programs, or additional executive benefits, that it may adopt from time to time.   
    
  (b)        Executive shall be entitled to four weeks of vacation with pay each year.

The Company shall reimburse Executive for all such reasonable expenses upon Executive s periodic presentation of an itemized account of such expenditures in accordance with the Company s policies and procedures and Section 21 hereof; provided, however, that any such reimbursement will be made no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred.  The Company agrees to pay Executive an additional amount to cover the incremental additional income taxes incurred by Executive, if any, with respect to payment or reimbursement of any reasonable business expenses pursuant to this subsection (c); provided, however, that any such payment will be made no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the income tax was incurred.  
    
  (d)         Executive shall be permitted to make elective contributions to any Company-sponsored, non-qualified deferred compensation plan in accordance with the terms of such plan. 
    
  7.        Disability  .   
    
  (a)         If Executive shall become physically or mentally disabled during the Term to the extent that his ability to perform his duties and services hereunder is materially and adversely impaired (any such incapacity, a  Disability ), his Base Salary, bonus and other compensation provided herein shall continue while he remains employed by the Company; provided, that if such Disability (as determined in the Company s reasonable judgment, exercised in good faith) continues for at least three (3) consecutive months, the Company may terminate Executive s employment hereunder, in which case the Company within 10 business days shall pay Executive a cash payment equal to (i) his annual Base Salary as provided in Section 5(a) hereof to the extent earned but unpaid as of the date of termination ( Unpaid Salary ), (ii) the bonus payable pursuant to Section 5(b) for the fiscal year of the Company ending prior to the date of termination (to the extent earned based on performance under the goals and objectives of the applicable plan but not previously paid) ( Unpaid Bonus ) and (iii) Executive s then accrued but unused vacation ( Unpaid Vacation ) (the Unpaid Salary, Unpaid Bonus and Unpaid Vacation referred to sometimes together as the  Accrued Amounts ).  Additionally, in the event of a termination of employment due to Disability, the Company shall pay to Executive a pro-rata portion of the Target Bonus for the year in which the termination for Disability  
  
   3 

occurred, payable at the same time when the bonus payment for the year of termination otherwise would have been paid pursuant to Section 5(b).  All options, restricted stock and/or other equity awards held by Executive on the date of termination for Disability shall vest only through the date of termination according to the normal vesting schedule applicable to such awards and shall be treated in accordance with the applicable award agreements.   
    
  (b)         No payments or vesting under this Section 7 will be made if such Disability arose primarily from (a) chronic use of intoxicants, drugs or narcotics (other than drugs prescribed to Executive by a physician and used by Executive for their intended purpose for which they had been prescribed) or (b) intentionally self-inflicted injury or intentionally self-induced illness. 
    
  8.        Disclosure of Information  .  Executive acknowledges that, in and as a result of his employment with the Company, he has been and will be making use of, acquiring and/or adding to confidential information of the Company and its affiliates of a special and unique nature and value.  As a material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement and to pay to Executive the compensation stated in Section 5, as well as any additional benefits stated herein, Executive covenants and agrees that he shall not, at any time while he is employed by the Company or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, divulge or disclose for any purpose whatsoever, any confidential information (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as  confidential information ), in any form or medium, that has been obtained by or disclosed to him as a result of his employment with the Company and which the Company or any of its affiliates has taken appropriate steps to safeguard, except to the extent that such confidential information (a) becomes a matter of public record or is otherwise available to the general public, other than as a result of any act or omission of Executive, (b) is required to be disclosed by any law, regulation or order of any court or regulatory commission, department or agency, in which event Executive shall give prompt notice of such requirement to the Company to enable the Company to seek an appropriate protective order or confidential treatment, (c) must be disclosed to enable Executive properly to perform his duties under this Agreement or (d) was developed by Executive prior to his employment by the Company.  Upon the termination of Executive s employment, Executive shall return such information (in whatever form) obtained from or belonging to the Company or any of its affiliates which he may have in his possession or control. 
    
  9.        Covenants against Solicitation  .  Executive acknowledges that the services he is to render to the Company and its affiliates are of a special and unusual character, with a unique value to the Company and its affiliates, the loss of which cannot adequately be compensated by damages or an action at law.  In view of the unique value to the Company and its affiliates of the services of Executive for which the Company has contracted hereunder, because of the confidential information to be obtained by, or disclosed to, Executive as set forth in Section 8 above, and as a material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement and to pay to Executive the compensation stated in Section 5 hereof, as well as any additional benefits stated herein, and other good and valuable consideration, Executive covenants and agrees that throughout the period Executive remains employed or compensated hereunder and for one year thereafter, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the United States of America (i) solicit or attempt to convert to other insurance carriers or other corporations, persons or other  
  
   4 

entities providing these same or similar products or services provided by the Company and its affiliates, any customers or policyholders of the Company or any of its affiliates; or (ii) solicit for employment or employ any individual who was employed by the Company or any of its affiliates during the term of Executive s employment with the Company.  Should any particular covenant or provision of this Section 9 be held unreasonable or contrary to public policy for any reason, including, without limitation, the time period, geographical area, or scope of activity covered by any restrictive covenant or provision, the Company and Executive acknowledge and agree that such covenant or provision shall automatically be deemed modified such that the contested covenant or provision shall have the closest effect permitted by applicable law to the original form and shall be given effect and enforced as so modified to whatever extent would be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law.  

10.        Termination  .  During the Term: 
    
  (a)        Either the Company or Executive may terminate his employment at any time for any reason upon written notice to the other.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company may terminate Executive s employment for Just Cause pursuant to Section 10(b) below or in a Control Termination pursuant to Section 10(c) below.  Without limiting the foregoing, Executive may terminate his employment With Reason pursuant to Section 10(d) below.  Executive s employment shall also terminate (i) upon the death of Executive or (ii) after Disability of Executive pursuant to Section 7 hereof.  The date on which Executive s employment with the Company terminates for any reason is called the  Termination Date . 
    
  (b)        The Company may terminate Executive s employment at any time for Just Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Just Cause  shall mean:  
    
   (i)  (A) material breach by Executive of this Agreement not cured within 15 days after written notice to Executive by the Company, (B) a material breach of Executive s duty of loyalty to the Company or its affiliates not cured within 15 days after written notice to Executive by the Company, or (C) willful malfeasance or fraud or dishonesty of a substantial nature in performing Executive s services on behalf of the Company or its affiliates, which in each case is willful and deliberate on Executive s part and committed in bad faith or without reasonable belief that such breach or action is in the best interests of the Company or its affiliates;  
    
  (ii)  Executive s use of alcohol or drugs (other than drugs prescribed to Executive by a physician and used by Executive for their intended purposes for which they had been prescribed) or other repeated conduct which materially and repeatedly interferes with the performance of his duties hereunder, which materially compromises the integrity or the reputation of the Company or its affiliates, or which results in other substantial economic harm to the Company or its affiliates;  
  
   5 

(iii)  Executive s conviction by a court of law, admission that he is guilty, or entry of a plea of   nolo contendere   with regard to a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude;  
    
  (iv)  Executive s unscheduled absence from his employment duties other than as a result of illness or disability, for whatever cause, for a period of more than three (3) consecutive days, without consent from the Company prior to the expiration of the three (3) day period;  
    
  (v)  Executive s failure to take action or to abstain from taking action, as directed in writing by a member of the Board or a higher ranking executive of the Company or CNO, where such failure continues after Executive has been given written notice of such failure and at least five (5) business days thereafter to cure such failure; or 
    
  (vi)  any intentional wrongful act or omission by Executive that results in the restatement of CNO s financial statements due to a violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
    
    No termination shall be deemed to be a termination by the Company for Just Cause if the termination is as a result of Executive refusing to act in a manner that Executive believes in good faith would be a violation of applicable law or where Executive acts (or refrains from taking action) in good faith in accordance with directions of a member of the Board or higher ranking executive but was unable to attain the desired results because such results were inherently unreasonable or unattainable. 
    
  (c)        The Company may terminate Executive s employment in a Control Termination.  A "Control Termination" shall mean any termination by the Company (or its successor) of Executive s employment for any reason within six months in anticipation of or within two years following a Change in Control. 
    
  The term "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following: 
    
    (i) the acquisition (other than an acquisition in connection with a  Non-Control Transaction ) by any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) of "beneficial ownership" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of CNO or its Ultimate Parent representing 51% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of CNO or its Ultimate Parent entitled to vote generally with respect to the election of the Board or the board of directors of CNO s Ultimate Parent; or  
  (ii) as a result of or in connection with a tender or exchange offer or contest for election of directors, individual board members of CNO (identified as of the date of commencement of such tender or exchange offer, or the commencement of such election contest, as the case may be) cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board; or  
  
   6

  For purposes of this Agreement,  Ultimate Parent  shall mean the parent corporation (or if there is more than one parent corporation, the ultimate parent corporation) that, following a transaction, directly or indirectly beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the outstanding securities entitled to vote with respect to the election of the board of directors of CNO (or its successor).

    (e)        Upon termination of Executive s employment with the Company for any reason (whether voluntary or involuntary), Executive shall be deemed to have voluntarily resigned from all positions that Executive may then hold with the Company and any of its affiliates; provided that such deemed resignation shall not adversely affect Executive s rights to compensation or benefits under this Agreement and shall not affect the determination of whether Executive's termination was for Just Cause or With Reason. 
           11. 
    Payments Following Termination  . 
       
  (a)        In the event that Executive s employment is terminated by the Company for Just Cause or if Executive voluntarily resigns (other than With Reason), then (i) the Company within 10 business days shall pay Executive a cash payment of his Base Salary as provided in Section 5(a) hereof that was earned but unpaid as of the date of termination and (ii) no bonus for the year of termination will be earned or paid to

All stock options, restricted stock and/or other equity awards held by Executive on the date of termination shall be treated in accordance with the applicable award agreements. 
    
  (c)  In the event that Executive is terminated (i) by the Company without Just Cause (and other than a termination due to expiration of the Term, death, Disability or a Control Termination), (ii) by reason of expiration of the Term or (iii) by Executive With Reason, then the Company shall pay Executive within 30 days of the Termination Date the Accrued Amounts.  Additionally, following such a termination, Executive shall be entitled to receive (i) a bonus pursuant to Section 5(b) based on CNO s actual performance for the year in which Executive is terminated (prorated for the partial year period ending on the Termination Date), payable at the same time when such bonus amount normally would have been paid pursuant to Section 5(b), and (ii) a cash lump sum (payable within 75 days following the Termination Date) equal to the sum of his annual Base Salary and Target Bonus.  All stock options, restricted stock and/or other equity awards held by Executive on the date of termination shall be treated in accordance with the applicable award agreements.  
    
   (d)  In the event that Executive is terminated by the Company (or its successor) in a Control Termination as so defined, then the Company shall pay Executive within 30 days of the Termination Date the Accrued Amounts.   Additionally, following such a termination, Executive shall be entitled to receive (i) a bonus pursuant to Section 5(b) based on CNO s actual performance for the year during which Executive is terminated (prorated for the partial year period ending on the Termination Date), payable at the same time as such bonus payment would have been paid pursuant to Section 5(b), and (ii) a cash lump sum (payable within 75 days following the Termination Date) equal to two times the sum of (A) his Target Bonus and (B) his annual Base Salary.  All stock options, restricted stock and/or other equity awards held by Executive upon the occurrence of a Change in Control shall be treated in accordance with the applicable award agreements.  
    
   (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment of any severance under this Agreement is conditioned upon the execution by Executive within 60 days following the Termination Date of a separation and release agreement in a form acceptable to the Company and the observation of such waiting or revocation periods, if any, before and after execution of the agreement by Executive as are required by law, such as, for example, the waiting or revocation periods required for a waiver and release to be effective with respect to claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, provided that the Company delivers to Executive such agreement within seven days of the Termination Date.  In the event that the 60-day period following the Termination  
  
   8 

Date straddles two calendar years, the severance payments described above shall not be paid prior to the second of such calendar years. 
    
  12.        Character of Termination Payments  .  The amounts payable to Executive upon any termination of his employment shall be considered severance pay in consideration of past services rendered on behalf of the Company and his continued service from the date hereof to the date he becomes entitled to such payments and shall be the sole amount of severance pay to which Executive is entitled from the Company and its affiliates upon termination of his employment during the Term.  Executive shall have no duty to mitigate his damages by seeking other employment and, should Executive actually receive compensation from any such other employment, the payments required hereunder shall not be reduced or offset by any such other compensation. 
    
  13.        Representations of the Parties  . 
    
  (a)        The Company represents and warrants to Executive that (i) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes valid and binding obligations of the Company; and (ii) the employment of Executive on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement will not conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to: (A) the certificate of formation, (B) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company is a party or bound or to which its property is subject, or (C) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company, or any regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company. 
    
  (b)        Executive represents and warrants to the Company that: (i) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Executive and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Executive; and (ii) neither the execution of this Agreement by Executive nor his employment by the Company on the terms and conditions contained herein will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which Executive is a party or bound or to which his property is subject, or any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to Executive of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over Executive or any of his property. 
    
  14.        Arbitration of Disputes; Injunctive Relief  .

If the first two arbitrators cannot agree on the appointment of a third

arbitrator, then the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except with respect to the selection of arbitrators, which shall be as provided in this Section.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  All reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by Executive pursuant to this Section 14 shall be paid on behalf of or reimbursed to Executive promptly by the Company; provided, however, that in the event the Company prevails in such proceedings, Executive shall immediately repay all such amounts to the Company. 
    
  (b)        Executive acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by Executive of Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement will give rise to irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages will not be adequate relief for such injury.  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the Company and Executive agree that the Company may seek and obtain injunctive relief, including, without limitation, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and/or permanent injunctions, in a court of proper jurisdiction to restrain or prohibit a breach or threatened breach of Section 8 or 9 of this Agreement.  Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to the Company for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from Executive.   
    
  15.        Notices  .  Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if sent by registered mail to his residence, in the case of Executive, or to the business office of its General Counsel, in the case of the Company. 
    
  16.        Waiver of Breach and Severability  .  The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by either party.

  17.        Entire Agreement  .  Other than any equity award agreements entered into pursuant to the CNO Financial Group, Inc. Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan or any subsequent incentive plan, this instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties and, as of the Effective Date, supersedes all other obligations of the Company and its affiliates under other agreements or otherwise.  The compensation and benefits to be paid under the terms of this Agreement are in lieu of all other compensation or benefits to which Executive is entitled from CNO, the Company, and its affiliates, and upon termination of Executive s employment with the Company Executive will not be entitled to receive any severance or other payments beyond those specified in this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be changed orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, extension or discharge is sought. 
    
  18.        Binding Agreement and Governing Law; Assignment Limited  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their lawful successors in interest (including, without limitation, Executive s estate, heirs and personal representatives) and, except for issues or matters as to which federal law is applicable, shall be construed in  
  
   10 

accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Indiana.  This Agreement is personal to each of the parties hereto, and neither party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other. 
    
    19.        Indemnification  .  If Executive was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including involvement as a witness) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a  Proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its affiliates, Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys  fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by Executive in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to Executive if he ceases to be an officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of Executive's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that the Company shall indemnify Executive in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by Executive only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Company.  The right to indemnification conferred in this paragraph shall include the obligation of the Company to pay the expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an  Advance of Expenses  provided, however, that, if and to the extent that the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an Advance of Expenses incurred by Executive in his capacity as an officer or employee shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on behalf of Executive, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that Executive is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this paragraph or otherwise. 
    
  20.         No Third Party Beneficiaries  .  The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person. 
    
  21.        Section 409A  .  This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the  Code ), and will be interpreted accordingly.  References under this Agreement to Executive s termination of employment shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which Executive has experienced a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of Executive s separation from service with the Company Executive is a  specified employee  as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or announcements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder or payable under any other compensatory arrangement between Executive and the Company or any of its affiliates as a result of such separation from service is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to Executive) until the date that is six months following Executive s separation from service (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code), at which point all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 21 shall be paid to Executive in a  
  
   11 

lump sum and (ii) if any payments of money or other benefits due to Executive hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax.  To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to Executive under this Agreement constitute  deferred compensation  under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to Executive in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(l)(iv).  Additionally, to the extent that Executive s receipt of any in-kind benefits from the Company or its affiliates must be delayed pursuant to this Section 21 due to his status as a  specified employee,  Executive may elect to instead purchase and receive such benefits during the period in which the provision of benefits would otherwise be delayed by paying the Company (or its affiliates) for the fair market value of such benefits (as determined by the Company in good faith) during such period.  Any amounts paid by Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reimbursed to Executive as described above on the date that is six months following his separation from service.  Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated as a  separate payment  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  The Company shall consult with Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 21, provided that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to Executive with respect thereto. 
    
  22.    Effect of Excise Tax and Limit on Golden Parachute Payments. 
    
  (a)           Contingent Reduction of Parachute Payments  . If there is a change in ownership or control of CNO that would cause any payment or distribution by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any other person or entity to Executive or for Executive s benefit (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (each, a  Payment , and collectively, the  Payments ) to be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax, the  Excise Tax ), then Executive will receive the greatest of the following, whichever gives Executive the highest net after-tax amount (after taking into account federal, state, local and social security taxes): (1) the Payments or (2) one dollar less than the amount of the Payments that would subject Executive to the Excise Tax (the  Safe Harbor Amount ). If a reduction in the Payments is necessary so that the Payments equal the Safe Harbor Amount, then the reduction will be determined in a manner which has the least economic cost to Executive and, to the extent the economic cost is equivalent, will be reduced in the inverse order of when payment would have been made to Executive, until the reduction is achieved.  Any reductions pursuant to this Section shall be made in a manner intended to be consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    
  (b)        Determination of the Payments  . All determinations required to be made under this Section, including whether and when the Safe Harbor Amount is required and the amount of the reduction of the Payments and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the Company which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to Executive.  Executive shall cooperate with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the Excise Tax. 
  
   12 

(c)         Adjustments  .        As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of a determination hereunder, it is possible that Payments will be made which should not have been made under clause (a) of this Section ( Overpayment ) or that additional Payments which are not made pursuant to clause (a) of this Section should have been made ( Underpayment ).  In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service, or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to Executive which Executive shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.  In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service, a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in the provisions of the Code or regulations pursuant to which an Underpayment arises under this Agreement, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.   
  23.    Counterparts  :  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 
    
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on November 7, 2016, to be effective as of the Effective Date.

    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of CNO Financial Group, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
