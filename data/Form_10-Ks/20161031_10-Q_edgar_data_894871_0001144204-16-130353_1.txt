1. Organization and Operations  

Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. (the
 Company ) was incorporated in Delaware in 1990 to design, manufacture, sell and service image-directed, computer-controlled
robotic software and hardware products for use in orthopedic surgical procedures.  On June 28, 2007, the Company completed
the sale of substantially all of its operating assets.  After completion of the sale, the Company no longer engaged in
any business activities related to its former business, described above. The Company s current operations are limited to
completing a business combination or strategic alliance. 

As of September 20, 2016, the Company signed
a letter of intent to pursue the acquisition of theMaven Network, Inc. and on October 14, 2016, it signed a share exchange agreement
with theMaven Network, Inc. and its shareholders to acquire the company as a wholly owned subsidiary. The closing is expected to
take place within a few weeks, but before December 31, 2016. 

If the Company does not complete the above
mentioned acquisition of theMaven Network, Inc., then the Company does not have an estimate as to when it will complete a qualified
merger, acquisition, or strategic alliance. There is no assurance that such opportunities will be available, or if available, upon
favorable terms. If the Company is unsuccessful in completing a suitable merger, acquisition or strategic alliance, then the Board
of Directors may liquidate the Company and distribute all its remaining assets, which consist primarily of cash and available-for-sale
securities, to its stockholders. 

The Company believes that if it identifies
and completes a suitable merger, acquisition or strategic alliance target, it may need additional capital to complete the transaction
or fund the continuing acquired operations. The Company, at this time, cannot estimate the amount of financing it may need for
a transaction. There is no assurance that it will be able to obtain any required funding for a transaction, or that if it is obtainable
it will be on acceptable terms. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations under Regulation S-X of the Securities
and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
rules and regulations. The condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to present
fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations and cash flows for the nine months then ended
have been included. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company
and the Company s management discussion and analysis included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period.  Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents include checking
and money market accounts held in two financial institutions. The Company has a checking account at one institution with a balance
of approximately $303,000 at September 30, 2016. The funds in this account are fully guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. The Company has a brokerage account with a second financial institution, with
a cash balance of approximately $176,000 at September 30, 2016. Assets in this brokerage account are protected by the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation ( SIPC ) up to $500,000 (with a limit of $250,000 for cash).   Throughout
the year, the account balances at these institutions periodically exceed FDIC and SIPC insurance coverage; however, the Company
has not experienced losses in these accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

Compensation costs for stock, warrants
or options issued to employees and non-employees are based on the fair value method and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC
718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation.   The value of warrants and options are calculated using
a Black-Scholes Model, using the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of issuance for the employee options
or warrants and the date of commitment for non-employee options or warrants, an expected dividend yield of zero, the expected life
of the warrants or options and the expected volatility of the Company s common stock. 

Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities  

The Company has a portfolio of investments
in available-for-sale debt securities, which consist of fixed income debt securities, and which are accounted for in accordance
with FASB ASC 320,  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.   Management determines the appropriate classification
of the securities at the time they are acquired and evaluates the appropriateness of such classifications at each balance sheet
date.  Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related
deferred tax effect, if any, are reported as other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders  equity. 

Fair Value Measurement  

FASB ASC 820   Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures   clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a
basis for considering such assumptions, FASB ASC 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used
in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: 

Level 1 - Observable
inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

Level 2 - Include other
inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.  

Level 3 - Unobservable
inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.  

The fair value hierarchy also requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 

In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the Company
measures its cash equivalents, investments in available-for-sale securities, and derivative liability at fair value. The company
classifies its cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities within Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy
because the company uses quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs to determine
their fair value. The Company s derivative liability is classified within Level 3. 

The carrying value of other current assets
and liabilities are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. 

Income Taxes  

Deferred income taxes have been provided
for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting under the liability method, using expected tax rates
and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided
when realization is not considered more likely than not. 

The Company applies the provisions of FASB
ASC 740,   Income Taxes .   ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in the Company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. 

The Company s policy is to classify
expenses as a result of income tax assessments as interest expense for interest charges and as penalties in general and administrative
expenses for penalty assessments. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial
statements. 

3.  Income (Loss) Per Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period plus dilutive common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method. 

Common stock equivalents for convertible
preferred stock of 1,101,281 and 1,321,537 shares were excluded from the calculation of loss per share for the nine months and
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because they were not dilutive; these shares would have been dilutive
if the Company had not had a net loss for the these periods. 

Stock options for the purchase of 175,000
and 200,000 shares of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of income per share for the nine months
and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because they were anti-dilutive. 

4.  Notes Receivable  

The Company has the following notes receivable: 

On August 11, 2016, the Company
entered into a term note agreement ( Term Note ) with theMaven Network, Inc. ( Borrower ) for a loan
of $150,000, plus expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the execution of this term note. The note is due at the
earlier of (1) February 13, 2017, or (ii) the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the agreement. The note is secured
by a personal guarantee of the principal officer of the Borrower ( Borrower Officer ). The $150,000 amount was
guaranteed by MDB until the extension of additional principal as described below. The principal amount as of August 11, 2016,
including expenses incurred by the Company, is $155,451. The Term Note provides that the principal amount of the loan
would be increased by $350,000 ( Additional Amount ), plus expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
the Term Note, if and when the Borrower Officer provides additional security for the total loan amount in the form of a
mortgage on certain real estate (the  Mortgage ).  The Mortgage was provided in late August and the Company
subsequently extended the Additional Amount to Borrower.  The interest rate on the borrowed amount is 8% per
annum.  The loan agreement contains additional covenants, representations and events of default. 

The Term Note was amended on August 25,
2016 to provide details of the Mortgage.  The Term Note was further amended on September 26, 2016 to extend an additional
$125,000 to the Borrower.  This additional $125,000 of principle is guaranteed by MDB. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregated
principal amount under the Term Note, including expenses incurred by the Company, is $638,351. 

5.  Investment in Available-for-Sale
Securities  

The following is a summary of the Company s investments
in available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited): 

The following is a summary of the Company s investments
in available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2015: 

The cost and fair value of investments
in fixed income available-for-sale debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), are as follows: 

Expected maturities will differ from contractual
maturities because the issuers of certain debt securities have the right to call or prepay their obligations without any penalties.  The
Company has classified the entire fair value of its investments in available-for-sale debt securities as current assets in the
accompanying condensed balance sheets. 

6.  Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and
Conversion Feature Liability  

The Company s Certificate of Incorporation
authorized 1,000,000 shares of undesignated, serial preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or
more series. The Board of Directors is authorized to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to
and imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock and designation of any such series without any further vote or action
by the Company s stockholders. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company s only outstanding series of convertible preferred stock is the Series G Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series
G ). 

The Series G stock has a stated value of
$1,000 per share, and is convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to 85% of the lowest sale price of the common
stock on its listed market over the five trading days preceding the date of conversion ( Beneficial Conversion Feature ),
subject to a maximum conversion price. The number of shares of common stock that may be converted is determined by dividing the
stated value of the number of shares of Series G to be converted by the conversion price. The Company may elect to pay the Series
G holder in cash at the current market price multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, no shares of Series G were converted into shares of common stock.  At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding Series G shares were convertible into a minimum of 1,101,281 and 1,321,537 shares
of common stock, respectively. 

Upon a change in control, sale of or similar
transaction, as defined in the Certificate of Designation for the Series G, each holder of the Series G has the option to deem
such transaction as a liquidation and may redeem his or her shares at the liquidation value of $1,000, per share, for an aggregate
amount of $168,496.  The sale of all the assets on June 28, 2007 triggered the preferred stockholders  redemption
option.  As such redemption is not in the control of the Company, the Series G stock has been accounted for as if it
was redeemable preferred stock and is classified on the balance sheet between liabilities and stockholders  equity. 

The conversion feature of the preferred
stock is considered a derivative according to ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging , therefore, the fair value of the derivative
is reflected in the financial statements as a liability, which was determined to be $88,395 as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited),
and has been included as  conversion feature liability  on the accompanying condensed balance sheets. As of December
31, 2015, the fair value of the derivative was determined to be $76,343. 

The fair value of the conversion feature
liability is calculated under a Black-Scholes Model, using the market price of the Company s common stock on each of the
balance sheet dates presented, the expected dividend yield, the expected life of the redemption and the expected volatility of
the Company s common stock. 

The Company s assessment of the significance
of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and considering factors specific to the conversion feature
liability. Since some of the assumptions used by the Company are unobservable, the conversion feature liability is classified within
the level 3 hierarchy in the fair value measurement. 

The expected volatility of the conversion
feature liability was based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The expected life assumption was
based on the expected remaining life of the underlying preferred stock redemption. The risk-free interest rate for the expected
term of the conversion feature liability was based on the average market rate on U.S. treasury securities in effect during the
applicable quarter. The dividend yield reflected historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected term of
the underlying preferred stock redemption. Therefore, the fair value of the conversion feature liability is sensitive to changes
in above assumptions and changes of the Company s common stock price. 

The table below shows the quantitative
information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of level 3 conversion feature liability: 

The changes in the fair value of the derivative
are as follows: 

7.  Stock-based compensation  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had no activity related to stock options. As of September 30, 2016, a summary of options outstanding under the
Company s 2014 options grant was as follows: 

The Company agreed to compensate each director
in the amount of $25,000 per year, payable quarterly, beginning on January 1, 2016. Such compensation may be paid to each director
either in the form of cash, or the Company s common stock or a combination thereof at the election of such director which
may be changed during the year with respect to future payments. The Company compensated one of its directors by issuing common
stock, one of its directors by issuing common stock and in cash, and the third director in cash for services rendered in 2016.
The Company compensated two of its four directors by issuing common stock, and two directors in cash for services rendered in 2015.
The number of shares issued to each director was determined based upon the equivalent cash compensation accrued divided by the
closing price of the Company s common stock on the date that the compensation is fully earned each quarter, which is the
last day of such quarter. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $9,375 and $28,125 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 for two directors, which was recorded as common stock to be issued. 

On January 11, 2016, the Company issued
41,667 shares of common stock to each of two directors as compensation for the three months ended December 31, 2015. These shares,
totaling 83,334, were valued at a per share price of $0.15, or a total of $12,500. 

On April 12, 2016, the Company issued 39,063
shares of common stock to one director, and 19,531 shares of common stock to a second director as compensation for the three months
ended March 31, 2016. These shares, totaling 58,594, were valued at a per share price of $0.16, or a total of $9,375 (unaudited). 

On July 11, 2016, the Company issued 39,063
shares of common stock to one director, and 19,531 shares of common stock to a second director as compensation for the three months
ended June 30, 2016. These shares, totaling 58,594, were valued at a per share price of $0.16, or a total of $9,375 (unaudited). 

On October 4, 2016, the Company issued
31,251 shares of common stock to one director, and 15,625 shares of common stock to a second director as compensation for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. These shares, totaling 46,876, were valued at a per share price of $0.20, or a total of $9,375
(unaudited). 

8.  Related Party Transactions  

The Company entered into an Investment
Banking Advisory Services agreement in November 2007 with MDB Capital Group LLC ( MDB ), and the parties extended this
agreement indefinitely in April 2009.  The agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30-days written notice. 

The Company has a securities investment
account with MDB, consisting of (a) available-for-sale investments totaling $1,097,470, that include short-term federal securities
of $4,951, and certificates of deposit, municipal securities and corporate debt securities totaling $1,092,519 at September 30,
2016 (unaudited), and (b) available-for-sale investments totaling $1,776,185, that include short-term federal securities of $4,885,
certificates of deposit, municipal securities and corporate debt securities totaling $1,771,300 at December 31, 2015. 

Mr. Christopher Marlett, the Chief Executive
Officer and director of the Company, is also the Chief Executive Officer of MDB. Mr. Gary Schuman, who is the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company, is also the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer of MDB.  The Company compensates for
Mr. Schuman s services in the amount of $3,000 per month, totaling $27,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 (unaudited).  Mr. Robert Levande, who is an officer and director of the Company, is also a senior managing director
of MDB. In addition to shares of common stock (as discussed in Note 6), Mr. Levande was compensated $9,375 for his services as
director for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited). 

MDB has guaranteed $125,000 of the principle
amount due on the Term Note from theMaven Network, Inc. described in Note 4 above. This guarantee will terminate upon the completion
of the acquisition of theMaven Network, Inc. which is described in Note 1 above and Note 10 below. 

9.  Commitments and Contingencies  

From time to time, the Company may be
subject to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company is not currently a party
to any legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The Company may have a liability for additional state franchise
taxes payable in the amount of approximately $44,000, plus interest at 18% per annum, for the years 2008-2014. Because of state
statutory provisions, the underpaid amount will only be due once assessed and demanded by the state.  The tax liability and
associated interest has not been included as an accrued liability because management has determined that the likelihood of the
state making the assessment is low.  Depending on circumstances, management may change its estimate of the probability of
an assessment and establish either an accrual or record a payment for the tax liability if assessed. 

10.  Subsequent Events  

On October 14, 2016, the Company entered
into a share exchange agreement under which the company will acquire theMaven Network, Inc. ( Maven ) in an exchange
of shares, whereby Maven will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The number of shares of the Company to be
issued for the equity of Maven will be determined by a formula, and it is anticipated that the Company will issue approximately
55% of its issued and outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction.  At the closing, it is agreed that one of
Maven s directors will become a director of the Company and several of their officers will also become officers of the Company
under their current employment arrangements. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to various conditions precedent, as
defined in the agreement, for each of the parties to the agreement. The Company anticipates the closing taking place within a few
weeks.

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward-Looking Statements  

The discussion in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates
and projections and certain assumptions made by management of Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. (the  Company ). Words
such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   believes,   seeks, 
 estimates,   could,   would,   may,   on target,   envisions, 
and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements
are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements.
Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise. However, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth in other reports
or documents the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), particularly
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
and with the audited financial statements and Notes thereto, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations that are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 as filed with the SEC. 

Overview  

The Company was founded to design, manufacture,
sell and service image-directed, computer-controlled robotic software and hardware products for use in orthopedic surgical procedures.
On June 28, 2007, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its assets.  After the sale, the Company became
inactive, and it is no longer engaged in any business activities related to its former business.  The Company s
current operations are limited to completing a business combination or strategic alliance. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
no employees, and the Company relies on outside contractors to perform basic and necessary services. 

Results of Operations  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of  $210,689  and
$164,051, respectively. The increase in net loss was due primarily to an increase in certain administrative expenses and a
decrease in net interest income, and offset by an increase in the change in fair value of the conversion feature liability
versus the prior period and by a decrease in director compensation in the current period versus the prior period. General
and administrative expenses were  $220,900 and  $179,694 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in administrative expenses is due primarily to an increase in
legal expenses of approximately $43,400 related to potential acquisition opportunities , offset  by a decrease of approximately $12,500 of director compensation expense compared to the
same period in 2015. The Company had a realized gain in available-for-sale securities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 of approximately $2,900, and a realized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $1,700. Net
interest income decreased by approximately $5,500 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Change in fair value of conversion feature was an increase of approximately $12,100 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, due to the change in fair value of the conversion feature of the Company s convertible
preferred stock; the change in value was an increase of approximately $11,000 for the same period in 2015. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of $94,162 and $52,121, respectively. The increase in net loss was due primarily to
an increase in certain administrative expenses in the current period versus the prior period, offset by a decrease in the change
in fair value of the conversion feature liability versus the prior period. General and administrative expenses were $102,009 and
$49,640 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in administrative expenses is due primarily
to the increase of approximately $42,800 of legal expense related to potential acquisition opportunities compared to the same period
in 2015. The Company had a realized gain in available-for-sale securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately
$100, and a realized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $200. Net interest income increased by
approximately $2,900 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Change
in fair value of conversion feature was a increase of approximately $2,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, due to
the change in fair value of the conversion feature of the Company s convertible preferred stock; the change in value was
an increase of approximately $10,500 for the same period in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company believes that existing cash,
cash equivalents, and short-term available-for-sale securities will provide sufficient working capital for the Company to meet
its operating plan for the next twelve months, assuming no acquisition or other combination event being consummated.  The
Board of Directors, including a director as its Chief Executive Officer, another director as its Secretary, and the Chief Financial
Officer of a related party as the Company s Chief Financial Officer assist the Company with its continuing obligations under
the federal securities laws and assist with the Company s plan to evaluate various merger, acquisition, or strategic alliance
opportunities. None of these individuals receive additional compensation, other than that which is disclosed herein, for providing
this assistance. If the Company does not complete the acquisition of theMaven Network, Inc. as described elsewhere in its
SEC filings, the Company does not have an estimate as to when it will complete a qualified merger, acquisition, or strategic, and
there is no assurance that such opportunities will be available, or if available, upon favorable terms.  If the Company
is unsuccessful in completing a suitable merger, acquisition or strategic alliance, then the Board of Directors may liquidate the
Company and distribute all its remaining assets, which consist primarily of cash and available-for-sale securities, to its stockholders. 

The Company believes that if it completes
a suitable merger, acquisition or strategic alliance target, it will need additional capital to complete the transaction and continued
funding of any acquired business. The Company, at this time, cannot estimate the amount of financing it may need for a transaction
or acquired business. There is no assurance that it will be able to obtain any required funding for a transaction, or that if it
is obtainable it will be on acceptable terms. 

The Company anticipates that it will incur
operating losses from operations in the next twelve months, until it enters into a suitable merger, acquisition or strategic alliance
transaction, or until its liquidation. 

Cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $127,000, which primarily consisted of an operating loss of
approximately $210,700, an increase in other current assets of approximately $12,900, an increase in accounts payable of
approximately $59,400, and adjustments for non-cash expenses consisting of stock-based compensation of approximately
$28,100, and a realized gain of approximately $2,900 on available for sale securities, and a change in the conversion feature
liability of approximately $12,100 related to the Company s Series G Convertible Preferred Stock. 

Cash provided by investing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $60,400 was due to the maturity of available-for-sale securities, offset
by an increase in notes receivable of $638,351. 

Cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ending September 30, 2015 was approximately $136,000, which primarily consisted of an operating loss of approximately
$164,000, an increase in other current assets of approximately $9,800, decrease in accounts payable of approximately $8,500, and
adjustments for non-cash expenses consisting of stock-based compensation of $37,500, and a realized gain of approximately $1,700
on available for sale securities, and a change in the conversion feature liability of approximately $11,000 related to the Company s
Series G Convertible Preferred Stock. 

Cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $65,000 was due to the purchase of available-for-sale securities of approximately
$1,221,000, offset by the maturity or sale of available-for-sale securities of approximately $1,156,000. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

There have been no significant changes
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company s annual financial
statements in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk  

Market risk represents the risk of loss
that may impact the Company s financial position, operating results or cash flows due to changes in U.S. interest rates.  The
Company s exposure to market risk is confined to its available-for-sale investments, all of which it expects to hold less
than one year. The goals of the Company s cash investment policy are the security of the principal amount invested and fulfillment
of liquidity needs.  The Company currently does not hedge interest rate exposure. Because of the short-term nature of
its investments, the Company does not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on the value
of its investment portfolio. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company held
approximately $479,000 in money market and checking accounts at two institutions.  The Company has a checking account
at one institution with a balance of approximately $303,000 at September 30, 2016.  The funds in this account are fully
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) as of September 30, 2016. The Company has a money market
account in a brokerage account with a second financial institution, invested in short-term federal securities, municipal bonds,
and corporate bonds, with a money market cash balance of approximately $176,000 at September 30, 2016. Assets in this brokerage
account are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ( SIPC ) up to $500,000 (with a limit of $250,000
for cash). Throughout the year the account balances at these institutions periodically exceed FDIC and SIPC insurance coverage;
however, the company has not experienced losses in these accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2016 (the  Evaluation Date ). Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the Evaluation Date, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting  

Our management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
and management has concluded that the Company s internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective as of September
30, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management believes that despite these weaknesses in internal controls, there are no
material misstatements in our annual financial statements. 

The material weakness relates to the lack
of segregation of duties in our financial reporting process and our utilization of outside third party consultants. We do not have
a separately designated audit committee. These weaknesses are due to our lack of additional accounting and operational staff. To
remedy this material weakness, we ultimately, if and when we conclude a business combination, will engage an internal accounting
staff to assist with financial reporting. We have no estimate as to when we will conclude a business combination so as to be able
to remedy this and any other material weaknesses we have in our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, the Company may be subject
to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company is not currently a party to any
legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

As of the date of this filing, there have
been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A (Risk Factors) contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  We operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known
and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially affect out operations.  The risks, uncertainties and other factors
set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, may cause our actual results,
performances and achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. 
If any of these risks or events occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds  

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

None. 

Item 5.  Other Information  

On August 11, 2016, the
Company entered into a term note agreement ( Term Note ) with theMaven Network, Inc. ( Borrower ) for a loan of $150,000, plus expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the execution of
this term note. The note is due at the earlier of (1) February 13, 2017, or (ii) the occurrence of certain events, as defined
in the agreement. The note is secured by a personal guarantee of the principal officer of the Borrower ( Borrower
Officer ). The $150,000 amount was guaranteed by MDB until the extension of the additional principal described below.
The principal amount as of August 11, 2016, including expenses incurred by the Company, is $155,451. The Term Note
provides that the principal amount of the loan would be increased by $350,000 ( Additional Amount ), plus
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Term Note, if and when the Borrower Officer provides additional
security for the total loan amount in the form of a mortgage on certain real estate (the  Mortgage ).  The
Mortgage was provided in late August and the Company subsequently extended the Additional Amount to Borrower.  The
interest rate on the borrowed amount is 8% per annum.  The loan agreement contains additional covenants, representations
and events of default. 

The Term Note was amended on August 25,
2016 to provide details of the Mortgage.  The Term Note was further amended on September 26, 2016 to extend an additional
$125,000 to the Borrower.  This additional $125,000 of principle is guaranteed by MDB. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregated
principal amount under the Term Note, including expenses incurred by the Company, is $638,351. 

On October 14, 2016, the Company entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) with theMaven Network, Inc., a Nevada corporation
( theMaven ), and the shareholders of theMaven, holding all of the issued and outstanding shares of theMaven (collectively,
 theMaven Shareholders ). The transaction will result in the Company acquiring theMaven as a wholly owned subsidiary
by the exchange of all of the outstanding securities of theMaven held by theMaven Shareholders for a number of newly issued shares
of the common stock of the Company, representing approximately 55% of the issued and outstanding shares immediately after the transaction
(the  Share Exchange ). The final number of shares of common stock to be issued to theMaven Shareholders  will
be determined and adjusted based on an exchange formula set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement. 

The Share Exchange Agreement contains customary
representations and warranties from theMaven, theMaven Shareholders and the Company. The closing is conditioned on certain pre-closing
conditions, including but not limited to the preparation of the financial statements of theMaven, entry of employment agreements
with the current, key employees of theMaven, the Company being current in its SEC reporting, the Company being able to file the
Current Report on Form 8-K for the transaction on a timely basis and certain other covenants being satisfied. At the closing, 35%
of the shares issued to theMaven Shareholders will be placed in escrow and will be subject to indemnification claims for breach
of representations and warranties in the Share Exchange Agreement by theMaven and theMaven Shareholders, and subject to repurchase
at $.01 per share by the Company if theMaven does not meet specific milestone achievements. The Company will be required to issue
additional shares of its common stock in the event it breaches any of its representations and warranties, up to the number of shares
placed in escrow by theMaven Shareholders. Upon the closing of the transaction, the Term Note will be cancelled and the Mortgage
and the guarantees of the Term Note will be terminated. 

The Company expects to close the Share
Exchange in the next several weeks. The Share Exchange Agreement provides that the transaction must close prior to December 31,
2016.

Exhibit 10.2  

GUARANTEE 

New York, New York Dated: ______ __, 2016 

In order to
induce Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. (herein called   Maker  ) to make the loan evidenced by the Promissory
Note, executed by  _______ , a Nevada corporation (the   Obligor  ) and dated
as of an even date herewith (the   Note  ) or grant other financial accommodations to or for the account of (or
in reliance on the credit of) the Obligor, the undersigned, ____ an [individual/corporation and a United States citizen] with a
business address at _______, irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Maker the punctual payment when due, whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of Obligor now or hereafter existing under the Note, whether
for principal, interest (including without limitation interest accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or suspension
of payments or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or like proceeding, relating to Obligor,
whether or not allowable as a claim), fees, expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses), indemnities or
otherwise (such obligations being the   Guaranteed Obligations  ). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the liability of the undersigned shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed
by Obligor to the Maker under the Note but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving Obligor.   

The undersigned guarantees that the Guaranteed
Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Note, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter
in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the undersigned with respect thereto. The obligations
of the undersigned hereunder are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted against the undersigned to enforce this Agreement, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Obligor or
whether Obligor is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the undersigned under this Agreement shall be absolute
and unconditional irrespective of, and the undersigned hereby irrevocably waives any right that it now or hereinafter may have
to assert as a defense, any of the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Note or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto; (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Note; (iii) any taking, exchange, release
or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee,
for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations
or any other assets of Obligor; (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the limited liability corporate existence of Obligor;
or (vi) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) that might otherwise constitute a defense
available to, or a discharge of, Obligor or the undersigned. 

This guarantee shall continue to be effective
or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise
be returned by the undersigned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Obligor or otherwise, all as though such payment
had not been made. 

The rights of the Maker hereunder shall
not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Maker of any right or remedy against the Obligor or against any other
person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security
therefor, guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. The Maker shall not be liable for any failure to demand,
collect or realize upon all or any part of any collateral or for any delay in doing so, nor shall the Maker be under any obligation
to sell or otherwise dispose of any collateral upon the request of the undersigned or any other person or to take any other action
whatsoever with regard to any collateral or any part thereof. 

The undersigned waives notice of acceptance
of this guarantee and notice of any liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice
of dishonor or nonpayment of any Guaranteed Obligations, or suit or taking other action by Maker against, and any other notice
to, any party liable thereon (including the undersigned) and waives any defense, offset or counterclaim to any liability hereunder.
Maker may at any time and from time to time (whether or not after revocation or termination of this guarantee) without the consent
of, or notice to, the undersigned, without incurring responsibility to the undersigned, without impairing or releasing the obligations
of the undersigned hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in part: (1) change the manner, place or
terms of payment, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew or alter, any Guaranteed Obligation, any security therefor,
or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and the guarantee herein made shall apply to the Guaranteed
Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered; (2) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal
with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing,
the liabilities hereby guaranteed or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder or under any other guarantee of the Guaranteed
Obligations) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or offset there against; (3) exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights against the Obligor or others (including the undersigned or under any other guarantee of the Guaranteed
Obligations) or otherwise act or refrain from acting; (4) settle or compromise any Guaranteed Obligation, any security therefor
or any liability (including any of those hereunder or under any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations) incurred directly
or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability
(whether due or not) of the Obligor to creditors of the Obligor other than Maker and the undersigned: and (5) apply any sums by
whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any Guaranteed Obligation to Maker regardless of what liability or liabilities of the
Obligor remain unpaid. 

No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability
of all or any part of the liabilities hereby guaranteed or of any security therefor or of any other guarantee of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall affect, impair or be a defense to this guarantee. The liability of the undersigned hereunder is primary, absolute
and unconditional and shall not be subject to any offset, defense or counterclaim of the Obligor. This guarantee is a continuing
one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created
in reliance hereon. This guarantee shall continue until the death of such undersigned or the discharge in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations. 

Upon the happening of any of the following
events: (i) the death of the undersigned or the dissolution or insolvency of the Obligor, or (ii) suspension of business of the
Obligor or of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (iii) the issuance of any warrant of attachment against any
of the property of the Obligor or of the undersigned or of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (iv) the making
by the Obligor or by the undersigned or by any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations of any assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or (v) a trustee, receiver or custodian being appointed for the Obligor or for the undersigned or for any other guarantor
of the Guaranteed Obligations or for any property of any of them, or (vi) any proceeding being commenced by or against the Obligor
or the undersigned or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement of debt,
insolvency, readjustment of debt, receivership, liquidation or dissolution law or statute, in each of the foregoing cases, as applicable,
Maker may, without notice to the Obligor or the undersigned or of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, make the Guaranteed
Obligations, whether or not then due, immediately due and payable hereunder as to the undersigned or of any other guarantor of
the Guaranteed Obligations, and Maker shall be entitled to enforce the obligations of the undersigned hereunder. All sums of money
at any time to the credit of the undersigned with Maker and any of the property of the undersigned at any time in the possession
of Maker may be held by Maker as security for any and all obligations of the undersigned hereunder, notwithstanding that any of
said money or property may have been deposited, pledged or delivered by the undersigned for any other, different or specific purpose.
Any and all claims of any nature which the undersigned may now or hereafter have against the Obligor are hereby subordinated to
the full payment to Maker of the Guaranteed Obligations and are hereby assigned to Maker as additional collateral security therefor. 

In the event Maker takes any action, including
retaining attorneys, for the purpose of effecting collection of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any liabilities of the undersigned
hereunder, or protecting any of Maker's rights hereunder, the undersigned shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of every
kind for protection of the rights of Maker or for collection of the Guaranteed Obligations or such liabilities, including reasonable
attorneys' fees. 

If claim is ever made upon Maker for repayment
or recovery of any amount or amounts received by Maker in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and Maker
repays all or part of said amount to any party by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order of any Court or administrative body
having jurisdiction over Maker or any of its property, or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by Maker
with any such claimant (including the Obligor), then and in such event the undersigned agrees that any such judgment, decree, order,
settlement or compromise shall be binding upon the undersigned, notwithstanding any prior revocation or release hereof or the prior
cancellation of any note or other instrument evidencing any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any prior release of any such liability
of the Obligor, and the undersigned shall be and remain liable to Maker hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the
same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by Maker. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive, and
continue in effect, notwithstanding any revocation or release hereof, unless such revocation or release shall specifically refer
to this paragraph. 

No delay on the part of Maker in exercising
any of its options, powers or rights, or partial or single exercise thereof, shall constitute a waiver thereof. No waiver of any
of its rights hereunder, and no modification or amendment of this guarantee, shall be deemed to be made by Maker unless the same
shall be in writing, duly signed on behalf of Maker, and each such waiver, if any, shall apply only with respect to the specific
instance involved, and shall in no way impair the rights of Maker or the obligations of the undersigned to Maker in any other respect
or at any other time. The undersigned shall have no right (whether by contract or by operation of law) of subrogation, restitution,
indemnification, reimbursement or any other or similar rights of a surety against the Obligor or any of its assets or property
or any security held for any liabilities of the Obligor, and all such rights are hereby expressly waived. This guarantee and the
rights and obligations of Maker and of the undersigned hereunder shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws (other
than the conflict of law rules) of the State of New York; and this guarantee is binding upon the undersigned, his, her, their or
its executors, administrators, successors or assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Maker, its successors or assigns. THE UNDERSIGNED
AGREES AND DOES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNDERSIGNED ON ANY MATTERS
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS GUARANTEE, AND THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION
OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR A DETERMINATION OF ANY DISPUTE AS TO ANY SUCH MATTERS AND AUTHORIZES THE SERVICE
OF PROCESS ON THE UNDERSIGNED BY REGISTERED MAIL SENT TO THE UNDERSIGNED AT THE ADDRESS OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREINBELOW SET FORTH. 

Any acknowledgement, new promise, payment
of principal or interest or other act by the Obligor and others, with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be deemed to
be made as agent of the undersigned for the purposes hereof, and shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of the undersigned
against Maker shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations, and if such statute of limitations
shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute. 

The undersigned shall be jointly and severally
liable with the Obligor and any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding that this guarantee may indicate
that more than one Person (as defined in the Financing Agreement) is to execute this guarantee, any person signing this guarantee
agrees to be bound hereby, whether or not any other Person signs this guarantee or any other guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations
at any time.
