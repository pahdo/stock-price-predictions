FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  

A.    The Company    

ModSys International Ltd. (formerly known as BluePhoenix Solutions Ltd.)
(together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ,  we , or  Modern Systems ) is an Israeli corporation,
which operates in one operating segment of information technology ( IT ) modernization solutions. 

Modern Systems develops and markets enterprise legacy migration solutions
and provides tools and professional services to international markets through several entities including wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries located in: the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania and Israel. These technologies and services allow
business to migrate from their legacy mainframe and distributed IT infrastructures to modern environments and programming languages. 

The Company has incurred negative cash flows from operations and net losses
in recent years. The Company currently uses its credit line with Comerica to support its negative cash flow position. Management
believes that the Company s current cash position is sufficient to support the ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. 

B.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15. This update addresses whether to present certain specific cash flow items as operating,
investing or financing activities. The amendments in this update are effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however, early
adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this standard update will have on its condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects
expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit
loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than
the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale
debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost
basis of the securities. The new standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning
January 1, 2019. The amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective
date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, which revises the guidance
in ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments
to employees, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The guidance is effective
for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which
establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise
from leases. This guidance results in a more faithful representation of the rights and obligations arising from operating and capital
leases by requiring lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases in the statement of financial
position and to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions, such as information about variable
lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. This guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective
approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments
  Overall (Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU 2016-01 ), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019.
The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of
Financial statements   Going concern (subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The new standard provides guidance on management s responsibility
in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related
footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events
that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the
financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 applies prospectively to annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and to annual
periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15
on its consolidated financial statements.  

C.  Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim
financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States for the annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

D.  Use of Estimates   

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

E.  Principles of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements include the Company's
and its subsidiaries  financial statements. The consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the condensed
consolidated financial statements from the date that control is achieved until the date that the control ceases. Control is the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its operating activities. In assessing
control, legal and contractual rights are taken into account. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation. 

F.   
       Revenue Recognition    

In the interim period the Company engaged in the business of selling framework
software, which fits the definition of  Off-the-shelf  software, along with maintenance for the initial 12-month period.
The Company couldn't establish a substantive VSOE for the undelivered element of annual maintenance and the entire revenue is
recognized throughout the maintenance period. 

Note 2   Goodwill:  

The following is a summary of the change in the carrying amount
of goodwill as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an annual
impairment test. The Company is one operating segment and one reporting unit related to its overall information technology modernization.
The goodwill impairment tests are conducted in two steps. In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting
unit. If the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the
impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value of all of its assets and liabilities in a manner
similar to an acquisition cost allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill. The implied fair value of
the goodwill is then compared to the carrying value to determine impairment, if any. 

The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using the market
approach which is based on the market capitalization by using the share price of the Company in the NASDAQ stock exchange and
an appropriate control premium. 

As of September 30, 2016 and for the first time, the net book value of the
reporting unit was higher than the market capitalization of the Company. However, there are other events and circumstances with
opposite effects such as net profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company assessed the totality of events and circumstances,
and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. Therefore, performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. 

Note 3   Fair Value Measurements: 

The accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy
for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels
as follows: 

Level 1   Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement
date. 

Level 2   Observable inputs such as quoted prices for
similar instruments and quoted prices in markets that are not active, and inputs that are directly observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively
traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities,
or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities. 

Level 3   Significant inputs to pricing that have little or no
observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring
significant management judgment or estimation, such as the complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair
value of financial instruments. 

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are summarized below:  

Note 4   Commitments and Contingencies: 

A.    Commitments    

Israel s Office of the Chief Scientist . One
of the Company s subsidiaries has entered into agreements with Israel s Office of the Chief Scientist, or OCS. This
subsidiary is obliged to pay royalties to the OCS at a rate of 3% on sales of the funded products, up to 100% of the dollar-linked
grant received in respect of these products from the OCS. As of September 30, 2016, the contingent liability that was not recognized
amounted to $184,000. 

Ministry of Production in Italy.  In July 2007, the
Company s subsidiary, Blue Phoenix I-Ter S.R.L. ( I-Ter ), received an amount of $585,000 from the Ministry of
Production in Italy for I-Ter s Easy4Plan product. Easy4Plan is a workflow management tool designed for ISO9000 companies.
36.5% of the funds received constitutes a grant, and the remaining 63.5%, is a 10-year loan to be repaid by I-Ter in annual installments
until September 2018. The loan bears a minimal annual interest of 0.87% and is linked to the euro. As of September 30, 2016, the
remaining loan balance was $102,000. 

B.  Contingencies   

The Company evaluates estimated losses for indemnifications due to product
infringement under FASB Topic ASC 450  Contingencies . At this time, it is not possible to determine the maximum potential
amount under these indemnification clauses due to lack of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically,
the Company has not incurred costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and has not accrued any liabilities related
to such indemnification obligations in the Company s financial statements. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis
provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition.
You should read this analysis in conjunction with the attached condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto,
and with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 30, 2016. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on our management s
beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical
facts are  forward-looking statements  for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events
or our future financial performance and financial guidance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology
such as  may,   might,   will,   should,   expect,   plan, 
 anticipate,   project,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   potential, 
 intend  or  continue,  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words
or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These statements are
only predictions. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date
hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements
in this document may turn out to be wrong. Actual events or results may differ materially. Our forward-looking statements can be
affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. In evaluating these
statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks outlined under the caption  Risk Factors 
set forth in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those contained from time to time in our other
filings with the SEC. We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  

Overview 

We develop and market enterprise legacy migration solutions
and provide tools and professional services to international markets through several entities including wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries located in: the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania and Israel. These technologies and services allow
businesses to migrate from their legacy mainframe and distributed information technology infrastructures to modern environments
and programming languages. 

Through the use of Modern Systems developed technology,
we: 

perform conversions of legacy mainframe applications written in COBOL, CA GEN, Natural, PL/1 to Java and C# code;   

perform conversions of legacy databases such as IDMS, ADABAS, VSAM, IMS, ICL to SQL Server, Oracle and DB2 environments; and   

sell  Data Mirroring  software that allows companies to integrate legacy databases with modern relational databases on a routine/ongoing basis enabling data share across an organization without migration.   

The technology conversion tools are proprietary to us
and perform automated code conversion of programming languages and database replication. 

In addition to the technology tools, we provide professional
services for: 

project management of migrations;   

understanding and mapping of the applications;   

testing;   

remediation; and   

on-going monitoring and management of the environments.   

On December 1, 2014, we completed a merger with Sophisticated
Business Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation doing business as  Ateras  ( Ateras ). At the closing, BP-AT
Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Modern Systems Corporation (f/k/a
BluePhoenix Solutions USA, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ModSys International Ltd.,
merged with and into Ateras (the  Ateras Merger ). As a result of the Ateras Merger, the separate corporate existence
of BP-AT Acquisition LLC ceased and Ateras continued as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Modern Systems
Corporation. The surviving entity was then renamed MS Modernization Services, Inc.   

Upon the closing of the Ateras Merger, we issued 6,195,494
unregistered ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.04 per share, to the former Ateras shareholders in exchange for the cancellation
of the shares of Ateras stock held by such shareholders in connection with the Ateras Merger. 

In December 2015, we issued 500,000 preferred shares
and warrants to purchase 250,000 ordinary shares in a private placement in exchange for $1 million in cash. We also issued an
additional 625,000 ordinary shares in the same transaction as the result of an anti-dilutive clause under a prior investment.
In December 2015, we also issued warrants to purchase 454,191 ordinary shares in exchange for loan modifications or loan guarantees.  

 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $125,000 and negative working capital of $2.1 million. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, together with the
available borrowing under our credit facility is sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.  

 Challenges and Opportunities      

 In a market that continues to innovate and evolve, new
technologies and practices, by definition, render existing technology deployments out-of-date or legacy. By the same measure,
however, in order for us to capitalize on the constant source of legacy solutions, we must evolve our solutions portfolio to deal
with the changing definition of what constitutes  leading edge  technologies and the growing set that is deemed to
be  legacy.  Over time, as one legacy set of technologies is gradually replaced, we must be capable of addressing
the modernization needs of the next set of aging technologies. However, these cycles are slow and provide us with the time to
update our technology and products and build the necessary knowledge in-house.  

 The fact that the modernization needs of the market
are evolving on a constant basis, it necessitates that we be capable of tracking and predicting changes in technologies. Anticipating
the needs of the IT modernization market and delivering new solutions that satisfy the emerging needs is a critical success factor.  

 However, even if we develop modernization solutions
that address the evolving needs of the legacy IT modernization market, we cannot assure that there will be a predictable demand
for our offerings. Variables ranging from the macro-economic climate, to the competitive landscape, and to the perceived need
that the enterprise market has for a specific modernization solution, may have an impact of a longer sales cycle or increased
pricing pressure.  

 To keep up with the demand for our solution, we must
retain our skilled personnel in the fields of project management, legacy systems, and leading modern technologies. Maintaining
and growing the requisite skill base can be problematic. Personnel with an understanding of legacy technologies are a finite resource
and the market for recruiting and retaining such workforce can be highly competitive.  

Recent
Developments      

 On August 4, 2016, we entered into the Sixth Amendment
to the existing loan agreement with Comerica Bank dated October 2, 2013 as previously amended, to: (i) extend the maturity date
of the non-formula revolving line and the revolving line to July 1, 2018; (ii) amend the EBITDA covenant requirements; and (iii)
change the definition of liquidity to include a requirement to have a minimum balance of cash in Comerica Bank of $250,000 at
the end of each month. The remaining substantive provisions of the credit facility were not materially changed by this amendment.
This amendment superseded the commitment letter which was entered in to on May 13, 2016.  

 Critical
Accounting Policies      

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Accordingly, we are required to make certain estimates,
judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the periods presented.  

 In the interim period we engaged in the business of
selling framework software, which fits the definition of  Off-the-shelf  software, along with maintenance for the initial
12-month period. We couldn't establish a substantive VSOE for the undelivered element of annual maintenance and the entire revenue
is recognized throughout the maintenance period.  

 There have been no material changes to our critical
accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15. This update addresses whether to present certain specific
cash flow items as operating, investing or financing activities. The amendments in this update are effective as of the first quarter
of 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard update will have
on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology
that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to
inform credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model
rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating
to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction
in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The new standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption
permitted beginning January 1, 2019. The amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
as of the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, which
revises the guidance in ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and will change how companies account for certain aspects of
share-based payments to employees, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures.
The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. Early
adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial position and results
of operations. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842), which establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and
liabilities that arise from leases. This guidance results in a more faithful representation of the rights and obligations arising
from operating and capital leases by requiring lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases
in the statement of financial position and to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions, such
as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. This guidance is effective prospectively
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted
using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance.  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial
Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU 2016-01 ), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for us beginning in its first quarter of 2019.
We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation
of Financial statements   Going concern (subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The new standard provides guidance on management s responsibility
in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related
footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events
that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial
statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 applies prospectively to annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and to annual periods
thereafter. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on our consolidated
financial statements. 

Operating Results 

The following table presents the percentage
relationships of certain items from our consolidated statement of operations, as a percentage of total revenue for the periods
indicated: 

Statement
of Operations Data (US$ and as a Percentage of Revenue): 

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenue   .  Our revenue is generated
from services and products sales. Our services include fixed-price projects, consulting fees, and long-term maintenance contracts.
Our product sales are licensing fees. Total revenue was $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a 55% increase
compared to revenue of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Total revenue was $8.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, a 9.9% increase when compared to revenue of $7.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Revenue generated from fixed price projects
was $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Revenue generated from fixed price projects was $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5.2 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in both periods is primarily due to an increased number of customers and
also a result of the higher average contract amount. 

Revenue generated from our consulting
services was $280,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $363,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease during the period is due to a lower average price of consulting agreements in the third quarter of 2016
compared to 2015. Revenue generated from our consulting services was $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase during the period is due to the increase in
the average price of consulting service agreements during the first half of 2016. 

Revenue generated from our licensing services was $489,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $85,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue generated
from our licensing services was $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $799,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue is attributable to license agreements from two new customers in 2016, which account
for 79% of the license revenue for the nine months ending September 30, 2016. 

Revenue generated from our long-term
maintenance contract services was $150,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $151,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue is attributable due to a decrease in the average value of the contracts for the
quarter. Revenue generated from our long-term maintenance contract services was $480,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to $402,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue from long-term maintenance contracts
is attributable to an increase in the number of customers with maintenance contracts. 

Cost of revenue.   Cost of revenue consists
of salaries of our employees and independent subcontractors on our implementation team, as well as other direct costs. Cost of
revenue was $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a 20% decrease when compared to $1.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenue was $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a 15.5% decrease
when compared to $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of revenue in the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to the decrease in employee and independent subcontractor costs and headcount
in 2016. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 33.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 64.4%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 47% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 61.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Gross profit.   Gross profit was $2.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a 191.1% increase when compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.5 million, a 49.7% increase from $3.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 66.8% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 35.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 53% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 38.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase during both
periods is attributable to the increase in licensing and maintenance revenues which yield a higher margin, as well as decreased
cost of revenues. 

Research and development costs.   Research
and development costs consist of salaries and consulting fees that we pay to professionals engaged in the development of new software
and related methodologies. Our research and development costs are allocated among our modernization suite of solutions and are
charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs were $640,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
a 77.3% increase when compared to $361,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development costs for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1.5 million compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of 39.5%. The increase for both periods is attributable to the increased research and development costs for our products
in 2016. As a percentage of revenue, research and development costs were 20.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to 17.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, research and development costs were 18.3%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 14.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and related expenses, travel expenses, sales
commissions, selling expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, rent, insurance, utilities, professional fees, and depreciation.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 13.4%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were $3.2 million compared to $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of 15.4%. The decrease in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 was the result of decreased professional fees
and employee costs primarily related to the Ateras Merger in 2015 and a reduced workforce in 2016. As a percentage of revenue,
selling, general and administrative expenses were 34.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 62.2% for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 37.9% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 49.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Amortization of intangible assets.
  We had amortization expense of $158,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $254,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $474,000, compared to
$762,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for both periods was the result of the amortization cost of
intangible assets related to the Ateras Merger, which was written down $1.5 million at the end of 2015. 

Financial expense, net.   Financial expenses
include interest paid on our bank loan and loans extended by others and expenses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rate. Our financial expense, net was $68,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $46,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Our financial expense was $214,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to financial
expense of $84,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Taxes on income.   We had income tax
expense of $3,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is current tax expense. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we had income tax expense of $21,000 compared to $20,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The tax expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is current tax expense. 

Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest .
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $29,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared
to net loss of $28,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and represented the non-controlling share in the net loss
of our subsidiary, Zulu Software Inc. until the merger of Zulu into MS Modernization Services, Inc. The non-controlling interest
now represents the non-controlling share in the net loss of our subsidiary, MS Modernization Services, Inc. Net loss attributable
to non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $80,000 compared to net loss of $90,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Capital Markets  

Since 1997, we have consummated various public and
private equity and debt offerings. In December of 2015, we completed a private placement with some of our major shareholders where
we issued $1 million of equity, consisting of 500,000 shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase 250,000 ordinary shares.
The preferred shares carry an 8% per annum cumulative dividend payable in kind by additional preferred shares, calculated based
on the purchase price of $2.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like.
In the event dividends are paid on any ordinary share, we shall pay an additional dividend on all outstanding preferred shares
in a per share amount equal (on an as if converted to ordinary share basis) to the amount paid or set aside for each ordinary
share. The preferred shares are convertible into our ordinary shares on a one-to-one basis at the option of the holder. Should
the volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares be $5.00 or more for ten consecutive trading days at any time two years
from the date of issuance, the preferred shares will be automatically converted into ordinary shares at the adjusted $2.00 share
price. Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the preferred shares
are entitled to a preferential payout of $3.00 per share. 

On December 29, 2015, our shareholders approved the issuance
of 45,082 warrants for our ordinary shares with an exercise price of $0.01 per share for an amendment to a promissory note. Fifty
percent (50%) of these warrants vested immediately while the remaining 50% vested on February 24, 2016 as the promissory note was
not paid in full on or before that time. At the same shareholder meeting, the shareholders approved the issuance of 409,837 warrants
for our ordinary shares with an exercise price of $0.01 per share for the issuance of guarantees of our term note with Comerica
Bank. Fifty percent (50%) of these warrants vested immediately while the remaining 50% vested on February 24, 2016, as the Comerica
Bank note was not reduced to below $1,000,000 on or before that date. 

While we have successfully raised financing in the
past in both the public and private capital markets, there can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to these
markets in the future. We have reported multiple year-over-year net losses that have resulted in negative cash flows. We cannot
be certain that any additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Raising additional funds in the future
by issuing securities could adversely affect our shareholders and negatively impact our operating results. If we raise additional
funds through the issuance of our ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable into our ordinary shares, the
percentage ownership of our then-existing shareholders will decrease, and they may experience additional dilution. In addition,
any convertible or exchangeable securities we might issue to raise capital may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable
to the holders than those of our existing ordinary and preferred shares.   

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $125,000 and negative working capital of $2.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million
and negative working capital of $2.0 million. The working capital decreased primarily due to the decrease in cash, increase in
trade receivables and increase in trade payables. 

Management believes that our current cash and cash
equivalents, together with the available borrowing under our credit facility, is sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable
future. We are continuing to reduce operating expenses and we continue to seek additional areas for cost reductions. 

Credit Facility  

On August 4, 2016, we entered into the
Sixth Amendment to the existing loan agreement with Comerica Bank dated October 2, 2013 as previously amended, to: (i) extend
the maturity date of the non-formula revolving line and the revolving line to July 1, 2018; (ii) amend the EBITDA covenant requirements;
and (iii) change the definition of liquidity to include a requirement to have a minimum balance of cash in Comerica Bank of $250,000
at the end of each month. The remaining substantive provisions of the credit facility were not materially changed by this amendment. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had borrowed $2.0 million
against our non-formula revolving line with a total of $2.0 million available and $533,000 against the formula revolving line with
a total of $1.5 million available. 

Cash Used in Operating Activities  

Net cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $0.9 million compared to $1.5 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The change is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, an increase in our trade receivables, and
an increase in other liabilities and deferred revenue. 

Cash Used in Investment Activities  

Net cash used in investment
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $269,000 compared to $11,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Net cash used in investment activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include purchases of computers
and computer software and the classification of cash to restricted cash as required by our covenants with Comerica. 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities  

Net cash used in financing activities was $179,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash provided of $1.8 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  Net cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of additional borrowing under our
credit facility.   

Contractual Commitments and Guarantees 

Chief Scientist  

One of our subsidiaries has entered into
an agreement with Israel s Office of the Chief Scientist, or OCS. This subsidiary is obliged to pay royalties to the OCS
at a rate of 3% on sales of the funded products, up to 100% of the dollar-linked grant received in respect of these products from
the OCS. As of September 30, 2016, the contingent liability amounted to $184,000. 

Ministry of Production in Italy  

During 2007, our subsidiary, Blue Phoenix I-Ter
S.R.L. ( I-Ter ), received an amount of $585,000 from the Ministry of Production in Italy under a plan called Easy4Plan.
Approximately $371,000 of that amount is in the form of a 10-year loan payable in equal annual installments until September 2018.
The loan bears an annual interest of 0.87% and is linked to the euro. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining loan balance was
approximately $102,000. Our subsidiary s operations have been reduced significantly, and if this trend continues, the Ministry
of Production in Italy may require the immediate repayment of the full outstanding loan amount. We do not currently anticipate
this occurrence. 

Operating Leases  

We
are committed under operating leases for rental of office facilities, vehicles, and other equipment for the years 2015 until
2019.   Operating lease payments for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were approximately $233,000.  

Indemnification of Office Holders  

We entered into an undertaking to indemnify
our office holders in specified limited categories of events and in specified amounts, subject to certain limitations. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have any off balance sheet
arrangements in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Effective Corporate Tax Rates 

Under Israeli law, Israeli corporations
were generally subject to a 26.5% corporate tax rate from January 1, 2014 and to a 25% corporate tax rate starting January 1, 2016.
An Israeli company that is subject to Israeli taxes on the income of its non-Israeli subsidiaries will receive a credit for income
taxes paid by the subsidiary in its country of residence, subject to certain conditions. Israeli tax payers are also subject to
tax on income from a controlled foreign corporation, according to which an Israeli company may become subject to Israeli taxes
on certain income of a non-Israeli subsidiary, if such subsidiary s primary source of income is a passive income (such as
interest, dividends, royalties, rental income, or capital gains). 

Our international operations are taxed at the local effective
corporate tax rate in the countries where our activities are conducted. We have significant amounts of carry forward losses, including
at Modern Systems Corporation from which our headquarters operates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk 

As of September 30, 2016, we have an outstanding
$102,000 loan to the Ministry of Production in Italy payable in annual installments until September 2018. The loan bears a minimal
annual interest of 0.87% and is linked to the euro. 

Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, such
as GBP, Euro or NIS versus the dollar may have an impact on our operating results and financial condition. Exposure relating to
these exchange rates is recorded under the financial expenses line item of our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly,
financial expenses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. 

The table below details the balance sheet main currency
exposure. The details are provided by currency, as of September 30, 2016 (at fair value): 

* Less than 1%. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

An evaluation was performed by our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in the Rules 13(a)-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act filings is (1) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September
30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act
that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent
all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within Modern Systems have been detected. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we may become involved
in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that,
if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

You should carefully consider the following risk
factors, in addition to the other information contained in this 
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occurs, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

In the past few years, we
have experienced significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. If these trends continue our business, financial condition
and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 

We have incurred significant losses and negative cash
flows from operations in the recent past. We had a net loss of $981,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and net losses
of $2.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and a net loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Our negative cash flows from operations were $906,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $125,000 compared to cash
and cash equivalents of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2015. These results have had a negative impact on our financial condition.
There can be no assurance that our business will become profitable in the future, that additional losses and negative cash flows
from operations will not be incurred, that we will be able to improve our liquidity or that we will be able to find alternative
financing if necessary.   

We have a credit facility
which expires July 1, 2018. There is no assurance that this credit facility will be available in the future or that we will be
able to obtain financing from other entities. 

We currently maintain a credit facility
which expires July 1, 2018. If we continue incurring significant losses and negative cash flows, as we have in the recent past,
we will be required to extend the term of this credit facility, raise funds or obtain alternative financing in order to finance
our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to extend the terms of this credit facility or that alternative financing
would be available, either from investors or financial institutions. Failure to raise the additional financing will result, or
other changes in our financial condition may result, in an event of default under our credit agreement, which could cause our lender
to declare all obligations immediately due and payable, to reclaim or sell certain of our assets that constitute collateral or
to take other remedies set forth in the credit agreement. 

Our credit facility requires us to comply
with covenants regarding achievement of an EBITDA target and our maintenance of certain financial ratios. In addition, these covenants
include restrictions on the operation of our business, including, among other things, our ability to pledge our assets, dispose
of assets, issue certain securities, make loans or give guarantees, make certain acquisitions, and engage in mergers or consolidations.
Our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of our credit facility could cause our lender to declare all obligations
immediately due and payable, to reclaim or sell certain of our assets that constitute collateral or to take other remedies set
forth in the credit agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our outstanding credit facility or negotiate
new credit facilities on favorable terms to us. 

If we do not reach agreements with financing
institutions, when required, we would encounter difficulties in funding our operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that
we would be able to raise cash or obtain financing from other third parties, including our shareholders. Our ability to obtain
financing, when required, depends in part on the future performance of our business and the condition of the capital markets. Moreover,
even if we succeed in negotiating financing arrangements with third parties, we cannot assure you that the terms of such arrangements
would be favorable to us or advantageous to our existing shareholders. 

Raising money to finance
our operations involves, from time to time, issuance of equity securities which may dilute your holdings in our company. 

In order to finance our operations, we may raise capital
from time to time from our shareholders or other third parties. Our arrangements with any such parties may include the issuance
of equity or debt securities or conversion options of loans and interest accrued thereon into equity securities. The issuance of
equity securities to investors would dilute your holdings in our company. 

Unfavorable changes in economic conditions
and decreases in capital expenditures by our customers have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations.      

 Our revenue is dependent upon the strength of the
worldwide economy. In particular, we depend upon our customers making continuing capital investments in information technology
products, such as those marketed and sold by us. These spending levels are impacted by the worldwide level of demand for enterprise
legacy IT modernization solutions and services. Demand is normally a function of prevailing global or regional economic conditions
and is negatively affected by a general economic slow-down as consumers reduce discretionary spending on information technology
upgrades.  

 We have identified and continue to experience, from
time to time, delays in purchase order placement by our customers and longer sales cycles. The negotiation process with our customers
has developed into a lengthy and expensive process. Customers with excess IT resources have chosen and may continue to choose
to develop in-house software solutions rather than obtain those solutions from us. Moreover, competitors may respond to challenging
market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, we anticipate that our low liquidity
and financial condition may negatively impact the willingness of customers to place purchase orders with us.  

 We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration
of any economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery. If the conditions in the markets in which we operate remain the same or worsen
from present levels, or if customers are dissuaded to contract us due to our financial condition, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.  

   We had negative cash flows from operations in
2015 and year to date in 2016, which may continue if we are not successful at increasing our revenues or reducing our expense
level.    

 We had negative operating cash flows of $906,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.5 million for 2015. We continue to assess our infrastructure costs and reduce
workforce and labor costs as they constitute a substantial portion of our costs of revenues, selling and administrative expenses,
and research and development expenses.   

 The loss of customers,
generally, and in particular the loss of a significant customer or several customers that, together, account for a significant
portion of our revenue, could cause a reduction in our revenue and profitability, which in turn could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.      

 We do not know if, or for how much longer, our customers
will continue to purchase the products and services that we offer. A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial
portion of our current and historical net revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our three largest customers accounted
for 40.1% of our revenue.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our four largest customers accounted for 62.3% of
our revenue.     

 The loss of any major customer or a decrease or delay
in orders or anticipated spending by such customer could materially reduce our revenue and profitability. The loss of several
customers at once may impact our revenue and profitability significantly, even if each of those customers, separately, has not
accounted for a significant amount of our revenue. The loss of customers may cause a significant decrease in revenue and profitability
which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our customers could also engage in business
combinations, which could increase their size, reduce their demand for our products and solutions as they recognize synergies
or rationalize assets and increase or decrease the portion of our total sales concentration to any single customer.  

 If we fail to estimate accurately the
costs of fixed-price contracts, we may incur losses.      

 We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
engagements on a fixed-price basis. We price these commitments based upon estimates of future costs. We bear the risk of faulty
estimates and cost overruns in connection with these commitments. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for
a fixed-price project, to accurately anticipate potential wage increases, or to complete our contractual obligations in a manner
consistent with the project plan could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  

 If we are unable to effectively control
our costs while maintaining our customer relationships; our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.      

 It is critical for us to appropriately align our
cost structure with prevailing market conditions to minimize the effect of economic downturns on our operations and, in particular,
to continue to maintain our customer relationships while protecting profitability and cash flow. However, we are limited in our
ability to reduce expenses due to the ongoing need to maintain our worldwide customer service and support operations and to invest
in research and development. In circumstances of reduced overall demand for our products, or if orders received differ from our
expectations with respect to the product, volume, price or other items, our fixed cost structure could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. If we are unable to align our cost structure in response to economic downturns
on a timely basis, or if such implementation has an adverse impact on our business or prospects, then our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.  

 We continue to assess our infrastructure costs and
reduce workforce and labor costs as they constitute a substantial portion of our costs of revenue, selling and administrative
expenses and research and development expenses.  

 Conversely, adjusting our cost structure
to fit economic downturn conditions may have a negative effect on us during an economic upturn or periods of increasing demand
for our information technology solutions. If we have to aggressively reduce our costs, we may not have sufficient resources to
capture new information technology projects, timely comply with project delivery schedules and meet customer demand. If we are
unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity to capitalize on periods of economic upturn, there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

If we are unable to accurately predict and respond
to market developments or demands, our business would be adversely affected. 

The information technology modernization
business is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and methodologies. This makes it difficult to predict demand and market
acceptance for our technology and services. In order to succeed, we need to adapt the solutions we offer in order to keep up with
technological developments and changes in customer needs. We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in enhancing our technology
and services, or developing or acquiring new technology that adequately addresses changing customer requirements. We also cannot
assure you that the technology and services we offer will be accepted by customers. If our technology and services are not accepted
by customers, our future revenue and profitability will be adversely affected. Changes in technologies, industry standards, the
regulatory environment and customer requirements, and new product introductions by existing or future competitors, could render
our existing solutions obsolete and unmarketable, or require us to enhance our current technology or develop new technology. This
may require us to expend significant amounts of money, time, and other resources to meet the demand. This could strain our personnel
and financial resources. Furthermore, modernization projects deal with customer mission critical applications, and therefore encapsulate
risk for the customer. Therefore, customers are more cautious in entering into transactions with us, and accordingly, the process
for approval and signing of deals may be lengthy and expensive. We make efforts to mitigate such risks associated with legacy modernization
projects but from time to time we encounter delays in the negotiation process. 

We may experience significant
fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results, which makes it difficult to make reliable period-to- period comparisons and may
contribute to volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares. 

Our quarterly and annual results of operations
have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations
can occur as a result of any of the following events: 

global economic trends;   

global political trends, in particular, in the middle east and in countries in which we operate;   

adverse economic conditions in various geographic areas where our customers and potential customers operate;   

acquisitions, mergers or disposition of companies and assets;   

timing of completion of specified milestones and delays in implementation;   

timing of product releases;   

timing of contracts;   

changes in selling and marketing expenses, as well as other operating expenses; and   

Currency fluctuations and financial expenses related to our financial instruments.   

As a result of the foregoing, we believe
that period-to-period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not
rely on them as an indication for future performance. Also, it is possible that our quarterly and annual results of operations
may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. 

A delay in collecting our fees could result in
cash flow shortages, which in turn may significantly impact our financial results. 

Typical modernization projects which
deploy our solutions are long-term projects. Therefore, payment for these projects or a substantial portion of our fees may be
delayed until the successful completion of specified milestones. In addition, the payment of our fees is dependent upon customer
acceptance of the completed work and our ability to collect the fees. Although the timing of receipt of our fees varies, we incur
the majority of our expenses on a current basis. As a result, a delay in the collection of our fees could result in cash flow shortages. 

Our results have historically
been materially adversely affected by the impairment of the value of certain intangible assets, and we may experience impairment
charges in the future .  

The assets listed in our consolidated balance sheet as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, include, among other things, goodwill valued at approximately $25.8 million. The applicable
accounting standards require that goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an annual impairment test, as well as periodic
impairment tests if impairment indicators are present. 

On December 1, 2014, we completed a merger with Sophisticated
Business Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation doing business as  Ateras.  The fair value purchase price allocation from
this merger resulted us recording approximately $5.2 million in technology intangible assets. We subjected the value of these intangible
assets to an annual impairment test as of December 31, 2015. The impairment test indicated that the fair value of these intangible
assets at this time was approximately $3.2 million, causing us to record non-cash impairment to amortization expense of approximately
$1.5 million.  

If we continue to experience reduced cash flows and
our market capitalization falls below the value of our equity, or actual results of operations differ materially from our modeling
estimates and related assumptions, we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our goodwill. If our goodwill
was deemed to be impaired in whole or in part due to our failure to achieve our goals, we could be required to reduce or write
off such assets. Such write-offs could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

If we are unable to attract, train, and
retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our objectives and our business could be   harmed.   

In order to achieve our objectives, we
hire software, administrative, operational, sales, and technical support personnel. The process of attracting, training, and successfully
integrating qualified personnel can be lengthy and expensive. We may not be able to compete effectively for the personnel we need.
Such a failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

If our technology or solutions do not function
efficiently, we may incur additional expenses. 

In the course of providing our modernization
solutions, the project team conducts testing to detect the existence of failures, errors, and bugs. If our modernization solutions
fail to function efficiently or if errors or bugs are detected in our technology, we may incur significant expenditures in an attempt
to remedy the problem. The consequences of failures, errors, and bugs could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, and financial condition. 

If we fail to satisfy our
customers  expectations regarding our solutions, or if we fail to timely deliver our solutions to our customers, we may be
required to pay penalties, our contracts may be cancelled and we may be the subject of damages claims. 

In the event that we fail to satisfy
our customers  expectations from the results of the implementation of our solutions, or if we fail to timely deliver our
solutions to our customers, these customers may suffer damages. When and if this occurs, we may be required under the customer
agreement to pay penalties to our customers or pay their expenses and our customers may have the ability to cancel our contracts.
Payments of penalties or a cancellation of a contract could cause us to suffer damages. In addition, we might not be paid for costs
that we incurred in performing services prior to the date of cancellation. In addition, from time to time we may be subject to
claims as a result of not delivering our products on time or in a satisfactory manner. Such disputes or others may lead to material
damages. 

We are exposed to significant claims for damage
caused to our customers  information systems. 

Some of the solutions we provide involve
key aspects of our customers  information systems. These systems are frequently critical to our customers  operations.
As a result, our customers may have a greater sensitivity to failures in these systems than do customers of other software products
generally. If a customer s system fails during or following the provision of modernization solutions or services by us, or
if we fail to provide customers with proper support for our modernization solutions, we are exposed to the risk of a claim for
substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. We cannot guarantee that the limitations of liability
under our product and service contracts, if any, would be sufficient to protect us against legal claims. We cannot assure you that
our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as
to any future claim. If we lose one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, it may have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the filing of legal claims against us
in connection with contract liability may cause us negative publicity and damage to our reputation. 

If third parties assert claims
of intellectual property infringement against us, we may, regardless of actual merits or success of any claims, suffer substantial
costs and diversion of management s attention, which could harm our business. 

Substantial litigation over intellectual
property rights exists in the global software industry. Software products may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement
claims as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability
not to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert claims of infringement
against us. In addition, our employees and contractors have access to software licensed by us from third parties. A breach of the
nondisclosure undertakings by any of our employees or contractors may lead to a claim of infringement against us. 

Any claim, with or without merit, could
be expensive and time-consuming to defend, and would probably divert our management s attention and resources. In addition,
such a claim, if submitted, may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a necessary
product or component. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at
all. 

A successful claim of product infringement
against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may experience greater than expected competition
that could have a negative effect on our business. 

We operate in a highly competitive market.
Competition in the modernization field is, to a large extent, based upon the functionality of the available solutions. Our competitors
may be in a better position to devote significant funds and resources to the development, promotion and sales of their technology
and services, thus enabling them to respond more quickly to emerging opportunities and changes in technology or customer requirements.
Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties
to increase such competitors  ability to successfully market their technology and services. We also expect that competition
will increase as a result of consolidation within the industry. As we develop new solutions, we may begin to compete with companies
with which we have not previously competed. Our competitors include: 

small vendors who provide specific solutions for a particular area of modernization, such as Anubex, Migrationware, HTWC,
                                                                     Fresche Legacy, Innowake, Software Mining and MSS International;   

large system integrators such as IBM, HP, Dell, Accenture, Cognizant, TCS, WIPRO, Infosys, Patni and Capgemini, some of whom
we also partner with;   

independent software vendors such as Rocket Software, Micro Focus and Metaware;   

We may be unable to differentiate our
solutions from those of our competitors, or successfully develop and introduce new solutions that are less costly than, or superior
to, those of our competitors. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete. 

Many of our existing and potential competitors
may have or may acquire more extensive development, marketing, distribution, financial, technological and personnel resources than
we do. This increased competition may result in our loss of market share and pricing pressure which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that competition with both competitors
within our industry and with the in-house information technology departments of certain of our customers or prospective customers
will not result in price reductions for our solutions, fewer customer orders, deferred payment terms, reduced revenue or loss of
market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary
rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. 

Our success and ability to compete are
substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology. Our intellectual property consists of proprietary or confidential
information that is not subject to patent or similar protection. Our employees and contractors have direct access to our technology.
In general, we have relied on a combination of technical leadership, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, and nondisclosure
agreements to protect our proprietary know-how. Unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use the technology
protected by those rights. Any infringement of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Intellectual property laws only provide limited protection and policing unauthorized
use of our products is difficult and costly, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as
fully as in the United States. 

Pursuant to agreements with certain of
our customers, we have placed, and in the future may be required to place, in escrow, the source code of certain software. Under
the escrow arrangements, the software may, in specified circumstances, be made available to our customers. From time to time, we
also provide our software directly to customers. These factors may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse
of our software. 

Risks Related to International Operations 

Marketing our solutions in international markets
may cause increased expenses and greater exposure to risks that we may not be able to successfully address.   

We have international operations, which
require significant management attention and financial resources. Depending on market conditions, we may consider establishing
additional marketing and sales operations, hire additional personnel, and recruit additional resellers internationally. 

Risks inherent in our worldwide business activities generally
include: 

currency exchange fluctuations;   

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;   

tariffs and other trade barriers;   

costs of localizing products for foreign countries;   

difficulties in operation of management;   

potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and   

the burdens of complying with a wide variety of local legislation.   

We cannot assure you that these factors
will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and, consequently, on our business, operating results,
and financial condition. 

Inflation, devaluation, and fluctuation of various
currencies may adversely affect our results of operations, liabilities, and assets. 

Since we operate in several countries,
we are impacted by inflation, deflation, devaluation and fluctuation of various currencies. We enter into transactions with customers
and suppliers in local currencies, while the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements and the functional currency
of our business is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in countries where we operate can adversely
affect the reflection of these activities in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, fluctuations in the value of our
non-dollar revenue, costs, and expenses measured in dollars could materially affect our results of operations, and our balance
sheet reflects non-dollar denominated assets and liabilities, which can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange
rates. 

Consequently, we are exposed to risks
related to changes in currency exchange rates and fluctuations of exchange rates, any of which could result in a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We are subject to multiple
taxing jurisdictions. If we fail to estimate accurately the amount of income tax due in any of these jurisdictions, our net income
will be adversely affected. 

We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions
and are subject to taxation by these jurisdictions at various tax rates. In addition, we may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions.
These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We cannot assure you that the
final tax outcome of these issues will not be different from management estimates, which are reflected in our income tax provisions.
Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such outcome occurs. 

Risks Related to Our Operations in Israel 

Political, economic, and military conditions
in Israel could negatively impact our business. 

Since the establishment of the State
of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, as well as incidents
of terrorist activities and other hostilities. Political, economic and security conditions in Israel could directly affect our
operations. We could be adversely affected by hostilities involving Israel, including acts of terrorism or any other hostilities
involving or threatening Israel, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, a significant
increase in inflation or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. Any on-going or future armed
conflicts, terrorist activities, tension along the Israeli borders or political instability in the region could disrupt international
trading activities in Israel and may materially and negatively affect our business and could harm our results of operations. 

Political relations could limit our ability to
sell or buy internationally. 

We could be adversely affected by the
interruption or reduction of trade between Israel and its trading partners. Some countries, companies and organizations continue
to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms and others doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies. Also, over the past
several years there have been calls in Europe and elsewhere to reduce trade with Israel. There can be no assurance that restrictive
laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses will not have an adverse impact on our business. 

Risks Related to Our Traded Securities 

If we fail to comply with
the minimum bid price requirement or any other minimum requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, our shares
may be delisted. 

On July 13, 2015 we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying
us that we were no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5450(b)(1)(C) for the NASDAQ Global Market, which requires
a company to maintain a minimum of $5,000,000 of its public shares outstanding to be held by non-affiliated shareholders. We were
given 180 days to comply with the Marketplace Rule. Because approximately 90% of our outstanding shares are held by affiliated
shareholders, we could not comply with this Marketplace Rule. On January 25, 2016, our ordinary shares were transferred to the
NASDAQ Capital Market, which does not have the requirement of Marketplace Rule 5450(b)(1)(C). 

In addition, the NASDAQ Capital Market continued
listing requirements requires us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the closing bid price of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market has ranged from $1.13 to $1.58 per share. 

We cannot assure you that we will be
able to, or will choose, to continue to comply with The NASDAQ Capital Market minimum requirements. If we fail to comply with those
requirements within the required period, and we shall not be able to take sufficient steps to regain compliance, our shares may
be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, which could reduce the liquidity of, and have an adverse effect on the price of, our
ordinary shares. We will continue to evaluate the costs and resource demands of being a public company, and consider all available
alternatives. 

The market price of our ordinary
shares has been and may be extremely volatile and our shareholders may not be able to resell the shares at or above the price they
paid, or at all. 

During the past years, the closing price
of our ordinary shares experienced price and volume fluctuations. The high and low closing prices of our ordinary shares traded
on the NASDAQ Global Market or NASDAQ Capital Market, as applicable during each of the last two years are summarized in the table
below: 

As of November 8, 2016, the market price of our ordinary
shares was $1.15. We cannot assure you that the market price of our ordinary shares will return to previous levels. The market
price of our ordinary shares may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including: 

our continued operating losses and negative cash flows;   

our inability to secure funding;   

any actual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors  quarterly revenue and operating results;   

shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts;   

adverse consequences of litigation;   

public announcements concerning us or our competitors;   

the introduction or market acceptance of new products or service offerings by us or by our competitors;   

changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;   

changes in security analysts  financial estimates;   

public announcements or the impact of any acquisitions or other strategic transactions;   

changes in accounting principles;   

sales of our shares by existing shareholders; and   

the loss of any of our key personnel.   

Future sales of our shares
to be registered for resale in the public market could dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders and could cause
the market price for our ordinary shares to fall. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had 18,692,774 ordinary
shares outstanding and 530,311 ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our employee equity compensation plans, including shares
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding employee options, warrants and unvested restricted stock units. As of September
30, 2016, we also had 500,000 preferred shares outstanding, which are convertible into ordinary shares, and outstanding warrants
to purchase 704,919 ordinary shares. 

The exercise of options by employees, officers and directors,
vesting of restricted stock units granted to employees, officers and directors, exercise of warrants by investors, conversion of
preferred shares and conversion of loans to equity would dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders. Any sales
in the public market of our ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of options, warrants or conversion rights, could adversely affect
the market price of our ordinary shares. If a large number of our ordinary shares is sold in a short period, the price of our ordinary
shares would likely decrease. 

Our U.S. shareholders could suffer adverse tax
consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company. 

Generally, a foreign corporation is a passive foreign
investment company ( PFIC ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if (i) 75% or more of its gross income in a taxable
year is passive income, or (ii) the average percentage of its assets for the taxable year that produce, or are held for the production
of, passive income is at least 50%. Passive income includes interest, dividends, royalties, rents and annuities. Passive assets
include working capital, including cash raised in public offerings. If we are or become a PFIC, our U.S. shareholders could suffer
adverse tax consequences, including being taxed at the ordinary income tax rates and being subject to an interest charge on gain
from the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares and on certain  excess distributions  with respect to our
ordinary shares. 

Our four largest shareholders
have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of
control. 

Based on information filed by our four largest shareholders
with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of September 30, 2016, our four largest shareholders, Columbia Pacific Opportunity
Fund, LP and affiliated entities, Mindus Holdings, Ltd., Prescott Group Capital Management, LLC and affiliated entities, and Lake
Union Capital Management, LLC and affiliated entities beneficially owned approximately 30.1%, 28.5%, 22.8% and 10.6%, respectively,
of our ordinary shares. Based on this information, we estimate that these shareholders, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately
92.0% of our ordinary shares as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (assuming no additional ordinary shares to prevent
anti-dilution are issued related to such ordinary shares). As a result, our four largest shareholders are able to control or influence
significantly all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers
or other significant corporate transactions. These shareholders may have interests that differ from yours, and they may vote in
a way with which you disagree and that may be averse to your interests. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and
