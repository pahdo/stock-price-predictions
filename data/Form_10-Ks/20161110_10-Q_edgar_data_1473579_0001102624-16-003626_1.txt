1.           SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Company Overview 

Boston Therapeutics, Inc., headquartered in Lawrence, MA, (OTC: BTHE) is a leader in the field of complex carbohydrate chemistry. The Company's initial product pipeline is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic molecules for diabetes: BTI-320, a non-systemic, non-toxic, therapeutic compound designed to reduce post-meal glucose elevation. In addition, a formulation of the material SUGARDOWN , falls within the regulatory dietary supplement guidelines and is designed to reduce post-meal blood sugar increases. In its patent portfolio, the Company had laboratory practical development of a combination material called IPOXYN. In its initial phase, IPOXYN is a continuous intravenous drug for the prevention of necrosis and treatment of ischemia with a first target indication for assisting in the treatment of lower limb ischemia often associated with diabetes.

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited resources and primarily a CRO/CMO contracted operating history. As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $19.9 million and $923,000 cash on hand as of September 30, 2016. Management is restructuring and is currently seeking additional capital through private placements and public offerings of its common stock.  In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings as well as collaboration activities in order to fund our operations. During the third quarter of 2015 through June 30, 2016, the Company has received ongoing funding through a fixed price convertible note from a related party and significant shareholder. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company raised additional funding from third party investors through the sale of 6% Convertible Notes. See Note 4. Management anticipates that cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2017. The Company has entered into an advisory agreement with an investment banking firm whereby the Company hopes to receive appropriate performance supported funding for its operations. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain continued financing and upon future profitable operations from the partnering, development and clarity of its new business opportunities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.  Without such additional capital, the Company may be required to cease operations.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue operations.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements for its year ended December 31, 2015 included in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, the statements contain all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary in order to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

The year-end balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The results disclosed in the statements of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable is stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.  Management establishes a reserve for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts.  Balances that remain outstanding

after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off against the allowance.  There were no allowances for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  At December 31, 2015, there were no accounts receivable. 

Inventory 

Inventory consists of raw materials, and finished goods of SUGARDOWN . Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, not in excess of net realizable value. The Company adjusts the carrying value of its inventory for excess and obsolete inventory. The Company continues to monitor the valuation of its inventory.

Revenue Recognition 

The Company generates revenues from sales of SUGARDOWN . Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, the product is shipped in accordance with the customers  Free On Board (FOB) shipping point terms and collectability is reasonably assured.  In practice, the Company has not experienced or granted significant returns of product. Shipping fees charged to customers are included in revenue and shipping costs are included in costs of sales.

As disclosed in Note 8 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements, Advance Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., a related party, accounted for 0% and 91% of the Company s revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Advance Pharmaceutical accounted for 0% and 78% of the Company s revenue, respectively.    

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to their short-term nature using level 3 inputs as defined above. The carrying value of the notes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, evaluated using level 3 inputs defined above based on quoted market prices on rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities, approximates the fair value.

Convertible Instruments 

U.S. GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable ASC 480-10.

When the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.

Common Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide the Company with a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) providing

that such contracts are indexed to the Company's own stock. The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company s control) or (ii) gives the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company assesses classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.

The Company s free standing derivatives consisted of warrants to purchase common stock that were issued in connection with the issuance of debt and of embedded conversion options with senior convertible debentures. The Company evaluated these derivatives to assess their proper classification in the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 using the applicable classification criteria enumerated under ASC 815-Derivatives and Hedging. The Company determined that certain embedded conversion and/or exercise features do not contain fixed settlement provisions. The convertible debentures contain a conversion feature such that the Company could not ensure it would have adequate authorized shares to meet all possible conversion demands. 

As such, the Company was required to record the debt and warrant derivatives which do not have fixed settlement provisions as liabilities and mark to market all such derivatives to fair value at the end of each reporting period.   

Based upon ASC 840-15-25, the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to its outstanding convertible notes.  Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based upon earliest issuance date.

Stock-Based Compensation 

Stock based compensation, including grants of employee and non-employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options, is recognized in the income statement based on the estimated fair value of the awards .  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted and recognizes the compensation cost of share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.

The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company has a limited history of market prices of the common stock, and as such volatility is estimated using historical volatilities over the prior three years. The expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of paying no dividends. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.

The Company grants stock options to non-employee consultants from time to time in exchange for services performed for the Company. Equity instruments granted to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. In general, the options vest over the contractual period of the respective consulting arrangement and, therefore, the Company revalues the options periodically and records additional compensation expense related to these options over the remaining vesting period.

Loss per Share 

Basic net loss per share is computed based on the net loss for the period divided by the weighted average actual shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the net loss for the period divided by the weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during each period unless the effect of such common equivalent shares would be anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of certain outstanding stock options using the treasury stock method.  The weighted average number of common shares for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 did not include 59,495,233, and 12,289,000 and 28,424,669 for convertible notes payable and accrued interest, options and warrants, respectively, because of their anti-dilutive effect. The weighted average number of common shares for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 did not include 8,029,900 and 12,424,669 for options and warrants, respectively, because of their anti-dilutive effect.

Recent Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-03   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ,  which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums.  The ASU is effective for fiscal

years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company elected early adoption of this standard during the period ended March 31, 2015, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU No 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Topic 605, Revenue Recognition  and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective retrospectively for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern . The new standard addresses management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  It requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures.  The standard will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.

2.             INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of material, labor and manufacturing overhead and are recorded at the lower of cost, using the weighted average cost method, or net realizable value.

The components of inventories at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net of inventory reserves, were as follows:

The Company periodically reviews quantities of inventory on hand and compares these amounts to expected usage of each particular product or product line. The Company records, as a charge to cost of sales, any amounts required to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.

3.           INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The SUGARDOWN  technology and patent applications are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of 14 years.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated annually for impairment.

Intangible assets consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Amortization expense was $48,214 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

4.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1   
 
  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2   
 
  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable

Level 3   
 
  inputs that are unobservable based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)

Financial liabilities as of September 30, 2016 measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (none at December 31, 2015):

The Company determined that certain conversion/exercise option related to a convertible note and issued warrants did not have fixed settlement provisions and are deemed to be derivative financial instruments, since the conversion/exercise prices was subject to reset adjustment should the Company issue any option to acquire the Company s common stock lower than the conversion /exercise price. Accordingly, the Company was required to record such conversion/exercise options as a liability and mark such derivative to fair value each reporting period. Such instrument was classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

4.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   (Continued) 

The fair value of the conversion/exercise options were calculated using a binomial lattice formula with the following weighted average assumptions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Conversion option:

Exercise option:

The risk-free interest rate is the United States Treasury rate on the measurement date having a term equal to the remaining contractual life of the instrument. The volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s share price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.  The dividend yield is 0% as the Company has not made any dividend payment and has no plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

Level 3 liabilities are valued using unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the derivative liabilities. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, determine its valuation policies and procedures.

The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s Chief Financial Officer and are approved by the Chief Executive Officer.

4.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   (Continued) 

Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the derivative liabilities for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate.

Significant observable and unobservable inputs include stock price, exercise price, annual risk free rate, term, and expected volatility, and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An increase or decrease in volatility or interest free rate, in isolation, can significantly increase or decrease the fair value of the derivative liabilities. Changes in the values of the derivative liabilities are recorded as a component of other income (expense) on the Company s condensed statements of operations.

The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable input for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

5.     CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 

In August and September 2016, the Company issued senior convertible debentures for an aggregate of $1,600,000 (the  Convertible Debentures ) in exchange for an aggregate net cash proceeds of $1,327,300, net of financing costs. The Convertible Debentures have a stated interest rate of 6% per annum payable quarterly beginning June 30, 2017 and are due two years from the date of issuance, the latest due September 15, 2018 and are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.075 with certain anti-dilutive (reset) provisions and are subject to forced conversion if either i) the volume weighted average common stock price for each of any 10 consecutive trading days equals or exceeds $0.50, or (ii) the Company s elects to lists a class of securities on a national securities exchange.

As long as the convertible notes remain outstanding, the Company is restricted from incurring any indebtedness or liens, except as permitted (as defined), amend its charter in any matter that materially effects rights of noteholders, repay or repurchase more than de minimis number of shares of common stock other than conversion or warrant shares, repay or repurchase all or any portion of any indebtedness or pay cash dividends.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Debentures, the Company issued an aggregate of 16,000,000 warrants to purchase the Company s common stock at $0.10 per share, expiring five years from the date of issuance, the latest being September 15, 2021. These warrants contain a cashless exercise and certain anti-dilutive (reset) provisions.

The Company determined that certain conversion/exercise option related to a convertible note and issued warrants did not have fixed settlement provisions and are deemed to be derivative financial instruments  due to price protection features present in the conversion/ exercise price that are not consistent with a fixed for fixed model.

The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the fair value of the derivative as of the issuance date of the debenture and warrants and to re-measure the derivatives at fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.

The Company recognized the value attributable to the conversion feature of the convertible debenture and issued warrants of $2,203,336 and together with financing costs of $272,700 (aggregate of $2,476,036) as a discount against the notes up to $1,600,000 with the excess of $876,036 charged to current period interest.

Overview

Boston Therapeutics, Inc., headquartered in Lawrence, MA, (OTC: BTHE) is a leader in the field of complex carbohydrate chemistry. The Company's initial product pipeline is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic molecules for diabetes:  BTI-320 is a non-systemic, non-toxic, therapeutic compound designed to reduce post-meal glucose elevation, and IPOXYN, an injectable anti-necrosis drug specifically designed to treat lower limb ischemia associated with diabetes.  In addition, the Company has completed development of SUGARDOWN   , a complex carbohydrate-based dietary supplement.  SUGARDOWN    is currently in the initial stage of market introduction, and in June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Advance Pharmaceutical to develop markets in Hong Kong, China and Macau.  In November 2014, we agreed to expand this marketing agreement to include 12 additional countries:  Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Brunei and Cambodia.  In March 2015, we agreed to further expand their authorized territories to include Japan.  

During the quarter, the Company continued its diabetes development and in October, in a press release, we presented positive topline data on postprandial hyperglycemia in high risk pre-diabetic Chinese population from the proof of concept trial conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. With  95% overall compliance across study groups, the phase II proof of concept trial demonstrated that both low dose (4g) and high dose (8g) BTI320 are safe and effective in significantly reducing various continuous glucose monitor parameters when compared against placebo. The Clinical Study was a 16 week double blind randomized placebo controlled study consisting of 60 prediabetic but otherwise healthy subjects.  Additional information regarding this clinical trial can be found at   https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02358668  . 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited resources and commercial operating history. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $19.9 million and has approximately $923,000 cash on hand as of September 30, 2016. Management is currently seeking additional capital through private placements, public offerings and mergers and acquisitions through the use of its common stock.  In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations. During the third quarter of 2015 through June 30, 2016, the Company has received ongoing funding through a fixed price convertible note from a related party and significant shareholder. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company raised additional funding from third party investors through the sale of 6% Convertible Notes. See Note 4. Management anticipates that cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this funding and cash management. The Company has entered into an advisory agreement with an investment banking firm whereby the Company is hopeful to receive funding for its operations. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.  Without such additional capital, the Company may be required to cease operations.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue operations.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015

Revenue

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,695, an increase of $7,093 as compared to revenue of $4,602 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is primarily related to the Company s proof of concept marketing efforts earlier in the year.

20 

Gross Margin

The Company generated a gross deficit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $5,538 as compared to a gross deficit of $45,467 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The improvement is primarily related to a charge for inventory obsolescence for approximately $45,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

21 

Research and Development

Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $16,071, a decrease of $30,680 as compared to $46,751 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is attributed to the Company ceasing nearly all if its research and development activities due to the lack of adequate funding and resources to manage the effort. The expense in 2016 is related to non-cash amortization of the intangible assets while the 2015 charges related to non-cash amortization of the intangible and part time consulting work.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $22,705, an increase of $21,629 as compared to $1,076 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in 2016 is related to a marketing consultant who is developing concept plans to test market and sell the Sugardown product and advertising costs as the Company continues a new program to sell the Sugardown product as a dietary supplement into targeted markets.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $471,944, an increase of $102,016 as compared to $369,928 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Payroll and related expenses including benefits decreased by approximately $56,000 as all employees were terminated during 2015 and the company was maintained by outside contracted consultants. This savings was offset by an increase of consulting services of approximately $100,000 which includes a $60,000 sign on bonus for the CEO contract engagement. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased approximately $214,000 primarily due to new options issued to the CEO.  Investor relation related expenses also decreased by approximately $30,000 as the company was unable to support investor initiatives due to funding.  The Company s cost reduction initiatives also resulted in a reduction of approximately $40,000 of legal, accounting and other professional services.   

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015

Revenue

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $40,283, a decrease of $54,499 as compared to revenue of $94,782 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is primarily related to revenue generated from sales to Advanced Pharmaceutical, a related party, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and through the Company s marketing partnership with Benchworks during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was offset by the Company s marketing efforts to expand awareness of the Sugardown product since the beginning of 2016.

Gross Margin

The Company generated a gross deficit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,579 as compared to a gross deficit of $54,175 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The difference in the margins in primarily caused by a charge for inventory obsolescence of $71,000 taken in the first nine months of 2015.

Research and Development

Research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $57,772, a decrease of $291,390 as compared to $349,162 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is attributed to the Company suspending nearly all if its research and development activities starting in the third quarter of 2015 due to the lack of adequate funding. The majority of the expense in 2016 is related to non-cash amortization of the intangible assets and part time consulting work.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $94,219, an increase of $58,249 as compared to $35,970 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in 2016 is related to advertising costs on radio and newspaper as the Company continues a new program to support the selling of the Sugardown product into test markets. The Company has also hired a consultant to assist with market development.

22 

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $798,717, a decrease of $471,308 as compared to $1,270,025 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Payroll and related expenses including benefits decreased by approximately $165,000 as all employees were terminated during 2015 and the company was maintained by outside consultants. The related consulting fees offset these savings by approximately $100,000. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased approximately $106,000 primarily due to new options granted to the CEO offset by all older options becoming fully vested or canceled due to past employee terminations.  Investor relations related expenses also decreased by approximately $250,000 as the company did not wish to support ant special investor initiatives pending the management restructuring.  The Company s cost reduction initiatives also resulted in a reduction of approximately $245,000 of legal, accounting and other professional services.  The Company also reduced its rent expense by approximately $25,000 by moving out of its facility in Manchester NH during 2015 and into less expensive office space.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $922,927 and accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $996,184. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $1,013,882 of cash in operations

We have incurred recurring operating losses since inception as we have worked to bring our SUGARDOWN    product to market and develop BTI-320 and IPOXYN.  We expect such operating losses will continue until such time that we receive substantial revenues from SUGARDOWN    or we complete the regulatory and clinical development for BTI-320 and IPOXYN.  Management is currently seeking additional capital through private placements, public offerings of its common stock and mergers or acquisitions through the use of its common stock.  In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations. During the third quarter of 2015 through June 30, 2016, the Company has received ongoing funding through a fixed price convertible note from a related party and significant shareholder. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company raised $1.6 million of additional funding from third party investors through the sale of 6% Convertible Notes. See Note 4. The Company also issued warrants to purchase an additional 16,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0,10 per share. The warrants expire in September 2021. The Company has entered into an advisory agreement with an investment banking firm whereby the Company is hopeful to receive funding for its operations. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.  Without such additional capital, the Company may be required to cease operations.

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information requested by this item, as provided by Regulation S-K Item 305(e). 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer ("CEO/CFO") of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term "disclosure controls and procedures", as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As disclosed in our annual report filing for the year ended December 31, 2015, there was a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that the Company experienced significant turnover in its accounting function, including the resignation of the Company's consulting Director of Finance during August 2015 and the retirement of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer on August 31, 2015.  While the Company hired a new consulting Director of Finance in August 2015, the Company did not have an adequate process established to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting and financial reporting matters, which resulted in our closing process not identifying all required adjustments and disclosures in a timely fashion.  Based upon the evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's CEO/CFO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Internal Controls

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
