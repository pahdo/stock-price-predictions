  Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016, the
condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive
income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been
prepared by RELM Wireless Corporation (the  Company ),
and are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation have been made. The condensed consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements at that
date. 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been
condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed
consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for a full year. 

Fair
Value 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash
equivalents, trade accounts receivable, available-for-sale
securities, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities approximated their respective fair value due to the
short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. 

The
Company uses observable market data or assumptions (Level 1 inputs
as defined in accounting guidance) that it believes market
participants would use in pricing the available-for-sale
securities.  There were no sales of
available-for-sale securities, nor gains or losses reclassified out
of accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of an
other-than-temporary impairment of the available-for-sale
securities. There were no transfers of available-for-sale
securities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Available-For-Sale Securities 

Investments
reported on the September 30, 2016 balance sheet consist of
marketable equity securities of a publicly held company. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the investment cost was
$3,242 and $2,761, respectively. Management intends to hold such
securities for a sufficient period in which to realize a reasonable
return, which periods may range between one to several years,
although there is no assurance that positive returns will be
realized or that such securities will not be liquidated in a
shorter-than-expected time frame to accommodate future liquidity
requirements. Accordingly, investments were classified as
non-current and available-for-sale. Investments are marked to
market at each measurement date, with unrealized gains or losses
presented as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income
or loss. 

Other Comprehensive Income 

Other
comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gain on
available-for-sale securities, net of taxes.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU   ) 2014-09 on revenue
recognition, which provides for a single, principles-based model
for revenue recognition and replaces the existing revenue
recognition guidance.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-14, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one
year.  The guidance is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and will replace
most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it
becomes effective.  It permits the use of either a
retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and early
adoption is not permitted.  The Company is evaluating this
standard and expects to have its analysis completed by mid-2017;
however, preliminarily the Company does not expect that this new
guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

In July
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory,   to simplify the guidance on the subsequent
measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using
last-in, first out or the retail inventory method. Under the new
standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. The new accounting guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with
early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the
adoption of this new guidance will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB released ASU
2015-17,    Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes,    which will require that deferred tax liabilities
and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of
financial position.  This is part of the FASB s
Simplification Initiative.   For  public business entities, the amendments in this
update are effective for financial statements issued for annual
periods after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods.  Earlier application is permitted for all
entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
period. The Company early adopted this standard as of December 31,
2015.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends the
guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of
financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily
affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities
under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure
requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU
clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment
when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized
losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the
amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in
which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted
except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial
liabilities under the fair value option resulting from
instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The
Company has not yet determined the potential effects of the
adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,   "Leases  ,  "   which amends leasing guidance by requiring
companies to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for all operating and capital (finance) leases with lease terms of
greater than twelve months. The lease liability will be equal to
the present value of lease payments. The lease asset will be based
on the lease liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial
direct costs. For income statement purposes, leases will continue
to be classified as operating or capital (finance), with lease
expense in both cases calculated substantially the same as under
the prior leasing guidance. The updated guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with
early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the
potential effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its
consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, 
  Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    The guidance will be effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.
The Company has evaluated the impact of the future adoption of this
standard and the Company does not expect the adoption to have a
material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.  

2.             

  Significant
Events and Transactions 

In
September 2015, the Company received awards under the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) Tactical
Communications Contract totaling approximately $26.2 million for
portable radios, repeaters, accessories and service. The awards
were for a base term of one-year that commenced on September 28,
2015 with four one-year options. The first option year was
partially exercised immediately, and the remainder of the first
option year was exercised in June 2016. Approximately $15.5
million, or almost 60% of the total amount, was specified in
delivery orders. Shipments under the delivery orders totaled
approximately $4.6 million and $14.0 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The contract term has been
extended for one additional year to September 27, 2017, but the
exercise, if any, of the remaining option years, is not specified
or guaranteed. 

7 

In
February 2016, the Company received an additional order from the
TSA totaling $4.2 million for accessories. Shipments for this order
totaled approximately $1.0 million and $4.2 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. This order was fulfilled
as of September 30, 2016. 

In May
2016, the Company announced and began implementing a capital return
program that included a stock repurchase program and a quarterly
dividend. Under the program, the Company s Board of Directors
approved the repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of the Company's
common stock, from time to time, pursuant to a stock repurchase
plan in conformity with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule
10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The repurchase program has no termination date. 
Please refer to Part II, Item 2 of this report for additional
details. Pursuant to the program, the Company s Board of
Directors approved two quarterly dividends of $0.09 per share of
the Company's common stock, one of which was paid on June 17, 2016
to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2016, and the other of
which was paid on September 16, 2016 to shareholders of record as
of September 1, 2016. 

3.             

  Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 

The
allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables was
approximately $49 on gross trade receivables of $6,286 and $4,171
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. This
allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable
value or the amount that the Company estimates will be collected of
the Company s gross trade receivables. 

4.             

  Inventories,
net 

The
components of inventory, net of allowances for slow-moving, excess
or obsolete inventory, consist of the following: 

Allowances for
slow-moving, excess, or obsolete inventory are used to state the
Company s inventories at the lower of cost or market. The
allowances were approximately $1,526 at September 30, 2016,
compared with approximately $1,685 at December 31,
2015. 

5.             

  Income
Taxes 

Income
tax expense totaling approximately $365 and $1,355 has been
recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared with $85 and $358, respectively, for the
same period last year. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s net
deferred tax assets totaled approximately $3,564 and $5,461,
respectively, and are primarily composed of net operating loss
carryforwards ( NOLs ), and research and development
costs and tax credits partially offset by deferred tax liabilities
of $1,168 and $671, respectively, primarily derived from
depreciation and the unrealized gain on available-for-sale
securities.  As of September 30, 2016, these NOLs total
approximately $816 for federal and $11,575 for state purposes, with
expirations starting in 2018 through 2030. 

8 

In
order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, the Company
will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to
utilize its NOLs prior to their expiration. The Company analyzed
all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the
weight of available evidence, the Company is more likely than not
to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The
recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits
is based upon the Company s conclusions regarding, among
other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on
information currently available, current and anticipated customers,
contracts and product introductions, as well as historical
operating results and certain tax planning strategies. 

The
Company has evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of
realizing the benefit of its net deferred tax assets. Based on its
evaluation, the Company has concluded that based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that the Company
will realize the full benefit of its net deferred tax assets
recorded at September 30, 2016. The Company cannot presently
estimate what, if any, changes to the valuation of its deferred tax
assets may be deemed appropriate in the future. If the Company
incurs future losses, it may be necessary to record additional
valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recognized
as of September 30, 2016. 

6.             

  Capitalized
Software 

The
Company accounts for the costs of software within its products
whereby certain software costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and
amortized over the estimated lives of the related products. The
Company determines technological feasibility to be established upon
the internal release of a detailed program design. Upon the general
release of the product to customers, development costs for that
product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years, based
on current and future revenue of the product. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not
capitalize any software costs. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company s amortization cost was
approximately $53 and $159, respectively, compared with $103 and
$308, respectively, for the same periods last year. Net capitalized
software costs totaled $211 and $370 as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. 

7.             

  Investment
in Securities 

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned
subsidiary, had purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of
Iteris (NASDAQ: ITI), which represented approximately 5.5% of
Iteris s outstanding shares.  At September 30,
2016, the corresponding unrealized gain of approximately $1,664,
net of tax of $923, is included in accumulated other comprehensive
income as a separate component of stockholders  equity. 
There was no impact to the Company s statement of
income.  

On
July 29, 2016, the Company, one of the Company s significant
stockholders, and certain of their affiliates entered into an
agreement with Iteris. Pursuant to the agreement, a Director of the
Company, who is an executive, co-founder and partner of the
significant stockholder that is party to the agreement, was
appointed to the Board of Directors of Iteris.  As of
September 30, 2016, the Company and the significant stockholder of
the Company beneficially own in the aggregate 2,600,194 shares of
Iteris, which represents approximately 8.1% of Iteris s
outstanding shares.

  Non-Cash
Share-Based Employee Compensation 

The
Company has employee and non-employee director stock option
programs. Related to these programs, the Company recorded non-cash
share-based employee compensation expense of $16 and $42,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared with $16 and $33, respectively, for the same periods
last year. The Company considers its non-cash share-based employee
compensation expenses as a component of selling, general and
administrative expenses. There was no non-cash share-based employee
compensation expense capitalized as part of capital expenditures or
inventory for the periods presented. 

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model to
calculate the fair value of a stock option grant. The non-cash
share-based employee compensation expense recorded in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was calculated using certain
assumptions. Such assumptions are described more comprehensively in
Note 10 (Share-Based Employee Compensation) of the Company s
Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

Executive
Overview 

Our
Business 

We
design, manufacture and market two-way land mobile radios,
repeaters, base stations, and related components and
subsystems. 

Two-way
land mobile radios can be hand-held (portable) or installed in
vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way land
mobile radios, enabling them to operate over a wider area. Base
station components and subsystems are installed at radio
transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal
and reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the
use of one antenna for both transmission and reception. We
incorporate both analog and digital technologies in our products.
Our digital technology is compliant with the Project 25 standard of
the Association of Public Communications Officials ( APCO
Project 25,  or  P-25 ). 

We
offer products under two brand names: BK Radio and RELM. Generally,
BK Radio-branded products serve the government and public safety
market, while RELM-branded products serve the business and
industrial market. 

Third
Quarter and Nine Months Summary 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our financial and
operating results improved compared with the same periods of last
year. Total sales and sales of digital products for both periods
increased significantly, which was attributed primarily to our
contract with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration
( TSA ). Growth in sales was the primary catalyst
behind improved operating income and positive cash flow. Also, in
the second quarter we announced and began implementing a capital
return program. As part of the program we paid quarterly dividends
of $0.09 per share in June and September, and repurchased 15,100 of
our shares since the inception of the program. 

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, net sales increased 93.7% to
approximately $14.7 million, compared with approximately $7.6
million for the same quarter last year. Sales of P-25 digital
products for the third quarter of 2016 increased 85.6% to
approximately $9.7 million (65.7% of total sales), compared with
approximately $5.1 million (66.4% of total sales) for the same
quarter last year. 

14 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, net sales increased 90.9% to
approximately $43.5 million, compared with approximately $22.8
million for the same period last year. Sales of P-25 digital
products for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
79.3% to approximately $28.1 million (64.6% of total sales),
compared with approximately $15.5 million (68.1% of total sales)
for the same period last year. 

Gross
profit margins as a percentage of sales for the third quarter and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately 31.4%
and 32.3%, respectively, compared with 45.8% and 42.0% for the same
periods last year. The comparative change in gross profit margins
was attributed primarily to competitive factors associated with the
TSA contract and delivery orders. 

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and
administrative expenses ( SG A ) totaled
approximately $3.5 million (24.1% of sales), compared with
approximately $3.2 million (41.9% of sales) for the same quarter
last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, SG A
totaled approximately $10.1 million (23.3% of sales), compared with
approximately $8.4 million (36.9% of sales) for the same period
last year. 

Pretax
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled
approximately $1.1 million, an increase of approximately $787,000,
compared with approximately $297,000 for the same quarter last
year. For the nine month period, pretax income increased
approximately 233.0% to $4.0 million, compared with $1.2 million
for the same period last year. 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense
totaled approximately $365,000 and $1,355,000, respectively,
compared with $85,000 and $358,000, respectively, for the same
periods last year. Our income tax expense is largely non-cash due
to utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards
( NOLs ). 

Net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled
approximately $719,000 ($0.05 per basic and diluted share), an
increase of approximately $507,000 compared with same quarter last
year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 net income
totaled approximately $2.6 million ($0.19 per basic and diluted
share), an increase of approximately $1.8 million from the same
period last year. 

As of
September 30, 2016, working capital totaled approximately $24.3
million, of which approximately $14.9 million was comprised of cash
and cash equivalents, and trade receivables. As of December 31,
2015, working capital totaled approximately $23.9 million, of which
approximately $8.8 million was comprised of cash and cash
equivalents, and trade receivables.

Results
of Operations 

As an
aid to understanding our operating results for the periods covered
by this report, the following table shows selected items from our
condensed consolidated statements of income expressed as a
percentage of sales: 

Net
Sales 

For the
third quarter ended September 30, 2016, net sales increased 93.7%
to approximately $14.7 million, compared with approximately $7.6
million for the same quarter last year. Sales of P-25 digital
products for the third quarter of 2016 increased 85.6% to
approximately $9.7 million (65.7% of total sales), compared with
approximately $5.1 million (66.4% of total sales) for the same
quarter last year. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, net sales increased 90.9% to
approximately $43.5 million, compared with approximately $22.8
million for the same period last year. Sales of P-25 digital
products for the quarter increased 79.3% to approximately $28.1
million (64.6% of total sales), compared with approximately $15.5
million (68.1% of total sales) for the same period last
year. 

The
comparative increase in total sales and sales of digital products
for the third quarter was attributed primarily to previously
announced orders from the TSA. Product shipments related to these
orders commenced in the first quarter of 2016. As of September 30,
2016, all TSA equipment orders were fulfilled. In the third quarter
our sales were supplemented by state agencies and legacy federal
customers, fueled in part by wildland fire suppression efforts.
Looking forward, requests for quotes from prospective new customers
and our funnel of sales prospects remain encouraging. 

Cost
of Products and Gross Profit Margin 

Gross
profit margin as a percentage of sales for the third quarter ended
September 30, 2016 was 31.4%, compared with 45.8% for last
year s third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was 32.3%,
compared with 42.0% for the same period last year. 

Our
cost of products and gross profit margin are derived primarily from
material, labor and overhead costs, product mix, manufacturing
volumes and pricing. Compared to the same periods last year, the
decrease in gross margins for the third quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 is attributed primarily to competitive
factors associated with the TSA orders, which comprised a
significant portion of our sales for both periods. The gross profit
margins realized from our product sales to customers other than TSA
were relatively consistent with previous quarters. 

We
continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to
maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor
costs. We also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to
improve quality, speed and costs. We anticipate that our current
contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives
will be available to us in the future. We believe gross margin
improvements can be realized by leveraging increased sales volumes
and manufacturing efficiencies. We may, however, encounter product
cost and competitive pricing pressures in the future. The extent of
their impact on gross margins, if any, is uncertain. 

16 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A
expenses consist of marketing, sales, commissions, engineering,
product development, management information systems, accounting,
headquarters and non-cash share-based employee compensation
expenses. 

SG A expenses
for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 were approximately
$3.5 million (24.1% of sales), compared with $3.2 million (41.9% of
sales) for the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, SG A expenses totaled approximately $10.1
million (23.3% of sales), compared with $8.4 million (36.9% of
sales) for the same period last year. 

Engineering and
product development expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled
approximately $1.1 million (7.8% of total sales), compared with
approximately $1.0 million (13.3% of total sales) for the same
quarter last year. For the nine month period engineering and
product development expenses totaled approximately $3.2 million
(7.3% of sales), compared with approximately $2.8 million (12.4% of
sales) for the same period last year. Additional staff-related
expenses and new product development projects were partially offset
by decreases in amortization of capitalized software. 

Marketing and
selling expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled
approximately $1.5million (10.5% of sales), compared with $1.2
million (15.8% of sales) for the third quarter last year. For the
nine month period, marketing and selling expenses totaled
approximately $4.4 million (10.0% of sales), compared with $3.2
million (14.0% of sales) for the same period last year. The
increase for both periods was attributed primarily to incentive
compensation, which correlates to sales performance. We have also
invested in sales staff and initiatives to capture more new
opportunities and drive sales growth. 

General
and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled
approximately $855,000 (5.8% of total sales), compared with
approximately $975,000 (12.8% of total sales) for the same quarter
last year. For the nine month period, general and administrative
expenses totaled approximately $2.6 million (5.9% of sales),
compared with $2.4 million (10.6% of sales) for the same period
last year. The decrease for the three months and the increase for
the nine months was related primarily to incentive compensation and
other headquarters expenses. 

Operating
Income 

Operating income
increased for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, totaling
approximately $1.1 million (7.3% of sales), compared with $300,000
(3.9% of sales) for the same quarter last year. For the nine month
period, operating income increased to approximately $3.9 million
(9.1% of sales), from $1.1 million (5.0% of sales) during the same
period last year. Increased operating income for both the third
quarter and nine month periods of 2016 was primarily the product of
sales growth and reduced gross profit margins pertaining to the TSA
delivery orders. 

Net
Interest Income (Expense) 

We
realized minimal net interest income for the third quarter and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, and for the comparable prior year
periods. Interest expense may be incurred from time to time on
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and we
earn interest income on our cash balances. The interest rate on
such revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2016 was 4.00%
per annum. This rate is variable based on the lender s prime
rate and our adjusted quick ratio. 

Income
Taxes 

We
recorded income tax expense of approximately $365,000 and
$1,355,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared with $85,000 and $358,000, respectively, for
the same periods last year. Our income tax expense is primarily
non-cash. 

17 

As of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net deferred tax assets totaled
approximately $3.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, and are
primarily composed of NOLs, offset by deferred tax liabilities of
$1.2 million and $671,000, respectively, primarily derived from
depreciation and the unrealized gain on available-for-sale
securities.  These NOLs total $816,000 for federal and $11.6
million for state purposes, with expirations starting in 2018
through 2030. 

In
order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, we will need to
generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our
NOLs prior to their expiration. The Company analyzes all positive
and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of
available evidence, we are more likely than not to realize the
benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net
deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our
conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of
future earnings based on information currently available and
current and anticipated customers, contracts and product
introductions, as well as historical operating results and certain
tax planning strategies. 

We have
evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing
the benefit of our net deferred tax assets. Based on our
evaluation, we have concluded that based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that we will realize the
benefit of our net deferred tax assets recorded at September 30,
2016. We cannot presently estimate what, if any, changes to the
valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in
the future. If we incur future losses, it may be necessary to
record additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax
assets recognized as of September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by
operating activities totaled approximately $8.3 million, compared
with approximately $0.1 million for the same period last
year.  Cash provided by operating activities was primarily
related to net income, accounts payable, prepaid expenses and other
current assets, customer deposits and depreciation and
amortization, partially offset by accounts receivable. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we realized net income of
approximately $2.6 million, compared with approximately $829,000
for the same period last year. Accounts payable for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $526,000, compared
with approximately $1.2 million for the same period last year due
to increasing volume and material purchases related in large part
to the TSA. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased
approximately $1.3 million related to our production and delivery
of a portion of the TSA delivery orders. For the same period last
year, prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by
approximately $648,000. Depreciation and amortization totaled
approximately $718,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared with approximately $697,000 for the same period last
year, reflecting depreciation of new equipment purchases. Accounts
receivable increased approximately $2.1 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $950,000 for the
same period last year, reflecting sales that were consummated later
in the quarter that had not yet completed their collection
cycle. 

Cash
used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 totaled approximately $1.8 million, $481,000 of which was
related to the investment in Iteris common stock (see Note 7 to our
Condensed Financial Statements in this report), and $1.3 million
that was utilized for the purchase of manufacturing and engineering
equipment. For the same period last year approximately $2.8 million
was used primarily for the investment in Iteris common stock (see
Note 7 to our Condensed Financial Statements in this report), and
$878,000 was utilized for the purchase of manufacturing and
engineering equipment. We anticipate that future capital
expenditures will be funded through our existing cash balance and
operating cash flow. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $2.5 million
was used in financing activities, primarily related to the
previously announced capital return program, which included two
payments of a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share totaling $2.5
million and stock repurchases totaling $83,000. We also received
approximately $30,000 provided by the issuance of common stock upon
the exercise of stock options. For the same quarter last year,
approximately $76,000 was provided by financing activities,
representing proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the
exercise of stock options. 

We have
a collateralized revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank
with maximum borrowing availability of $2 million and a maturity
date of December 28, 2016. 

18 

As of
September 30, 2016 and the date of this report, we were in
compliance with all covenants under the loan and security agreement
governing the revolving credit facility. For a description of such
covenants and the other terms and conditions of the loan and
security agreement, reference is made to Note 6 (Debt) of our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and the date of this report, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As of
September 30, 2016 and the date of this report, there was $2.0
million of borrowing available under the revolving credit
facility. 

Our
cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2016 was
approximately $8.6 million.  We believe these funds combined
with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing
availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to
meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
However, the current financial and economic conditions could limit
our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital, if
needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We also face other risks
that could impact our business, liquidity and financial condition.
For a description of these risks, see  Item 1A. Risk
Factors  set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

In
response to the SEC s financial reporting release, FR-60,
Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting
Policies, we have selected for disclosure our revenue recognition
process and our accounting processes involving significant
judgments, estimates and assumptions.  These processes affect
our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical
in assessing our financial and operating status.  We regularly
evaluate these processes in preparing our financial
statements.  The processes for revenue recognition, allowance
for collection of trade receivables, allowance for excess or
obsolete inventory, software development and income taxes involve
certain assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable
under present facts and circumstances.  These estimates and
assumptions, if incorrect, could adversely impact our operations
and financial position.  There were no changes during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 to our critical accounting
policies as described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

19 

Item 4.     CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (who serves as
our principal financial and accounting officer) have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Securities Exchange Act)
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. Based on
this evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2016. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of
Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
