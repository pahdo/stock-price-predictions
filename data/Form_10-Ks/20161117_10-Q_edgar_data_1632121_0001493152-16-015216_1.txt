Note
1   Business Organization and Nature of Operations   

Balance
Labs, Inc. ( Balance Labs  or the  Company ) was incorporated on June 5, 2014 under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Balance Labs is a consulting firm that provides business development and consulting services to start up and development
stage businesses. The Company offers services to help businesses in various industries improve and fine tune their business models,
sales and marketing plans and internal operations as well as make introductions to professional services such as business plan
writing, accounting firms and legal service providers.  

The
Company leverages its knowledge in developing businesses with entrepreneurs and start up companies  management whereby it
creates a customized plan for them to overcome obstacles so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s)
to their potential customers.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary
for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position of Balance Labs as of September 30, 2016 and
the unaudited condensed consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results for the full year. It is recommended that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related disclosures of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2015 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.  

Note
2   Going Concern   

The attached financial statements have
been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses from operations and has a
net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company used $478,823
of cash in operating activities and currently has $131,813 in cash. This will sustain the Company for only 3.9 months without
additional funds. Management plans to raise additional capital within the next two months that will sustain its operations for
the next year. In addition, the company will begin an active marketing campaign to market its services. 

Note
3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Cash
and Cash Equivalents     

The
Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates may include those pertaining to stock-based compensation and deferred tax
assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  

Concentrations
and Credit Risk   

One
customer provided 100% of revenues during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue related to its professional services to its customers when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability
is reasonably assured.  

The
Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740-10, which prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return.  

Management
has evaluated and concluded that there is material tax positions requiring recognition in the Company s financial statements
as of September 30, 2016. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months
of the reporting date.  

The
Company s policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest as interest expense and penalties as general
and administrative expenses in the statement of operations.  

Investment
  Related Party   

Investment
  related party is recorded at fair value on September 30, 2016. The Company holds its investments as available for sale
securities.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements include
the company s majority owned entities, all two wholly owned corporate subsidiaries (Balance Labs LLC., from April 15, 2016,
Balance AgroTech Co., from January 11, 2016). All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. 

Net
Loss Per Common Share   

Basic
and diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and warrants
from convertible debentures outstanding during the periods. The effect of 2,920,000 and 320,000 warrants and 2,120,000 and 0 shares
from convertible notes payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively were anti dilutive and not
included in dilutive loss per share.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is
generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value
amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually
the vesting period. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.  

The
Company has computed the fair value of warrants granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term used for
warrants is the contractual life. Since the Company s stock has not been publicly traded for a sufficiently long period
of time, the Company is utilizing an expected volatility figure based on a review of the historical volatilities, over a period
of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being valued, of similarly positioned public companies within its industry.
The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term
consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including
cash, accounts payable, and the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their
short maturities.  

We
adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). The adoption did not have a material
impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for
measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather
applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to
measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the
service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
    1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    

Level
    2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar
    assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
    not active.    

Level
    3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed
    by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.    

The
following table presents certain assets of the Company s measured and recorded at fair value on the Company s balance
sheet on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016.  

The
following table presents certain assets of the Company s measured and recorded at fair value on the Company s balance
sheet on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2015.  

The
following is a reconciliation of the level 3 Assets:  

Business
Segments    

The
Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.  

Advertising,
Marketing and Promotional Cost  s  

Advertising,
marketing and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on
the accompanying statement of operations. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September
30, 2015, advertising, marketing and promotion expense was $6,595 in 2016 and $0 in 2015, respectively.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the fiscal 2016 presentation. These reclassifications
have no impact on the previously reported net loss.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has evaluated all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact its condensed consolidated financial statements
and does not believe that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize
(i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of,
a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors;
however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We
are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing   .The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the
amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on
(a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s
promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied
at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments
in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement
necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact
on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Overview   

We
were incorporated on June 5, 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a consulting firm that provides business development
and consulting services to startup and development-stage companies. We provide businesses in various industries with customized
consulting services to meet their business needs and help them improve their business models, sales and marketing plans and internal
operations, as well as introduce these businesses to experienced professional contacts that would be vital to the success of these
companies. The Company is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940
Act ) and does not engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. The Company is
not managed like an active investment vehicle, is not an investment company registered under the 1940 Act, and is not required
to register under the 1940 Act.  

Our
business focuses on providing advice to entrepreneurs and assisting business owners so that their ideas can be fully developed
and implemented. Due to limited resources, lack of experienced management and competing priorities, startup and developmental
stage companies are not operating as efficiently as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could
assist in developing and executing certain strategies. We utilize our knowledge in developing businesses, share practical experiences
with our clients and introduce the business owners to experienced professionals who could help these inexperienced entrepreneurs
further implement their ideas. Startups and development stage businesses across all industries commonly experience these certain
 growing pains .  

Plan
of Operations   

Our
plan is to prepare our clients for the many inevitable challenges they will encounter and to develop a customized plan for them
to help overcome these obstacles, so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s) to their potential customers.  

Although
we ve only worked with one client since inception, our goal is to add and service a minimum of two to three new clients
between now and the end of 2016. We re marketing our services through both personal contact and online by (a) mining our
existing network of professional contacts via personal outreach programs, which will also target international prospects that
may wish to enter the US market; (b) expanding our network by attending targeted conferences and professional gatherings; and
(c) utilizing our website at www.balancelabs.co, plus engaging potential clients on social media, including LinkedIn, Facebook
and Twitter. However, because we have a limited budget allocated for an on-line marketing campaign, we anticipate that professionals
within our professional network and personal referrals from companies that are satisfied with our professional services are likely
to be our most significant and efficient near-term form of marketing.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company activated two subsidiaries, Balance Labs, LLC, Balance AgroTech Co. BalanceLabs
LLC, is strictly a management company that provides necessary administrative services to small companies.  

We
believe that we can support our year one clients with our existing full-time staff, supplemented with part-time sub-contracted
professionals and service providers, as necessary. Between now and the end of 2016, we intend to formalize our relationships with
these sub-contractors so that we can offer our clients turn-key business development products and services.  

Our
primary requirement for funding is for working capital in order to accommodate temporary imbalances between cash receipts and
cash expenditures (see  Liquidity and Capital Resources ).  

Acquisition   

On
April 4, 2016, the Company s subsidiary Balance AgroTech Co., entered into an agreement with Pimi Agro Cleantech Ltd. (Pimi)
where the shareholders of Pimi would exchange 100% of their shares for 15,400,000 Series A Preferred Shares in Balance Agrotech
Co. The preferred shares will pay a cash dividend of 2.5% or 5% PIK dividend at the election of the company. The Company will
use its best efforts for the filing of documents to allow the public trading of the Company s common shares. The stated
value of the preferred shares is $1.00. The original agreement called for a closing within 45 days from April 4, 2016. The agreement
has been extended. A closing is planned for January, 2017.  

Results
of Operations   

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 and the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Overview   

We
reported a net loss of $717,292 and $240,066 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase
of $477,226 or 199%, primarily due to a $39,000 reduction in revenues and increased interest expense of $294,872. For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 we reported a loss of $311,263 and a loss of $92,527 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, an increase of $218,736 or 236%. This was mainly due to an increase in interest expense and professional fees.  

Revenues   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated no revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we generated $39,000
from an entity which our CEO has an indirect 19% interest. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated no revenue
as compared to no revenue for the same period, the previous year.  

General
and administrative expenses   

General and administrative expenses
were $98,346 and $100,453 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $2,107 or 2%. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $46,764 and $8,866, an increase of
$37,898 or 428%. The increase cost was a result of higher accounting, consulting and transfer agent fees. 

Interest
expense   

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $295,408 and $536, respectively, which was attributable to the
short term advances provided by our CEO, and the amortization of debt discount on the $25,000 and $500,000 notes. For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 interest was $138,001 and $496 respectively, an increase of $137,505. This increase is
the result of the amortization of debt discount and short term advances as stated above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity   

We
measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:  

Investment
Agreement   

On
April 1, 2016, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the  Investment Agreement ) with Newel Trading Group
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Newel ) whereby Newel is obligated, providing the Company has met certain
conditions including the filing of a Form S-1 Registration Statement for the shares to be acquired, to purchase up to Twenty-Five
Million Dollars ($25,000,000) of the Company s common stock at the rates set forth in the Investment Agreement. Under the
Investment Agreement, the shares are purchased at the discretion of the Company by issuing a Put Notice when funds are needed.
In consideration for the execution and delivery of the Investment Agreement, Company issued 1,000,000 non-registrable shares of
Company s common stock. The Company also issued Newel 2,000,000 warrants at an exercise price of $3.50.  

Availability
of Additional Funds   

Except
for the monthly consulting fee to our CEO and Chairman of the Board and the lease of our office space, as described elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report, we currently do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. In addition, as of September
30, 2016, with regards to our professional service agreement that provided 100% of our revenues since inception, we and our client
have fully satisfied our professional service and payment obligations under the agreement, respectively. We are actively pursuing
new client relationships. Even if we were to add a new client(s), due to our current lack of a diversified client base, there
could be temporary imbalances between cash receipts and cash operating expenditures, which means that we may need additional capital.
The engagement revenues associated with most client engagements will self-fund the in-house and sub-contractor services we need
in order to supply products and services to our clients.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $346,888. The Company s cash flow used in operating
cash flows was ($478,823) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As discussed in Note 7 of the financial statements, the
Company has raised $500,000 in the debt financing. In addition, the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while
it continues to make changes in operations to further improve its cash flow and liquidity position. Based upon subsequent debt
financing and the Company s current cash flow projections, management believes the Company will need additional capital
resources to meet projected cash flow requirements for the next twelve months.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:  

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities    

We
experienced negative cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $478,823.
The net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $717,292 adjusted for non-cash
expenses of $720 and $268,190 increase accounts payable and accrued related party and by a $39,772 net increase in prepared expenses.  

Net Cash used in Investing Activities   

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company purchased $5,474 of
office equipment and opened an investment account with a deposit of $2,000. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities    

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $599,039 related to $120,000 of proceeds
from convertible note payable from related parties offset by the repayment of $20,961 of short term advances from related parties.
In addition, we received $500,000 for a convertible debenture (See Note 7 in the Financial Statements)  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

There
are no material changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our 10-K which was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. Please refer
to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business.  

Recent
Accounting Standards   

We
have implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and do not believe that
there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations.

Not
applicable.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure and Control Procedures   

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

This
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure
controls. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board
of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and includes those policies and procedures that:  

(1)  
      Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the issuer;   

(2)  
      Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and   

(3)  
      Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is appropriately recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods.  

Management
has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  

Based
on this assessment, management concluded that as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, it had material
weaknesses in its internal control procedures.  

As
of period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was ineffective. The Company s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below:  

Functional
Controls, Lack of Audit Committee and Segregation of Duties   

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing.  

The
Company does not have an audit committee and therefore there is no independent review and independent oversight over the Company s
financial reporting.  

There
is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of a small
number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation,
we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional
staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter at end of the fiscal year to determine whether
improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.  

Accordingly,
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by the Company s internal controls.  

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our
small size. Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial
actions upon receiving funding for the Company s business operations.  

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report herein.  

(c)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

We
are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or operating results. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings,
which arise, in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these
or other matters that may harm our business could arise from time to time.  

Item
1a. Risk Factors.   

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

On September 30, 2016, the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company loaned $120,000 to the Company at an interest rate of 10% due on October 1, 2017 (the  Loan ).
 In connection with the Loan, the Company issue 600,000
warrants at an exercise price of $1.00 which expire on October 1, 2019.  

The
preceding securities were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), but
qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The securities were exempt from registration under Section
4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance of such securities by the Company did not involve a  public offering, 
as defined in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the transaction, size
of the offering, and manner of the offering and number of securities offered. The Company did not undertake an offering in which
it sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, the Investor had the necessary investment intent
as required by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act since they agreed to, and received, the securities bearing a legend stating
that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these securities
would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a  public offering.  Based on
an analysis of the above factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act.  

Item
3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   

On
December 23, 2015 the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $25,000 (the  Note ).
The Note became due on March 23, 2016 and is now in default. The Note carries a default interest rate of $18%. The Note further
contains a provision that the lender may convert any part of the Note, including accrued interest that is unpaid into the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. As of September 30, 2016, the accrued interest on the Note is $2,730.

fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;  

3.
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present
in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
presented in this quarterly report;  

4.
The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  

a)  
      designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly for the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared;   

b)  
      designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c)  
      evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation;   

d)  
      disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting;   

5.
The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation, to the registrant s
auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):  

a) 
      all
    significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the registrant s
    ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for the registrant s auditors any
    material weaknesses in internal controls; and   

b)  
     any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
    management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal controls over financial reporting.
