A  .   Accounting Policies    
  General 
  Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (with its subsidiaries, the  Company ) principally engages in the operation, development, management and acquisition of commercial and residential real estate and land throughout the United States. The Company had approximately   $8.6 billion   of consolidated assets in   20   states and the District of Columbia at   September 30, 2016  . The Company s core markets include Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the greater metropolitan areas of New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C. The Company has regional offices in Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and the Company s corporate headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. 
  The Company recently completed an internal reorganization and are presenting reportable segments based on this new structure beginning with the reporting period ending September 30, 2016. The new structure is organized around the Company s real estate operations, real estate development and corporate support service functions. Real Estate Operations is comprised of   three   reportable operating segments: Office, Retail and Apartments. Development, Corporate and Other are the remaining   three   reportable operating segments. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period s reportable segment presentation. 
  Real Estate Operations represents the performance of the Company s core rental real estate portfolio and is comprised of the following   three   reportable operating segments: 
             
    Office   - owns, acquires and operates office and life science buildings. 
                
    Retail   -     owns, acquires and operates regional malls and specialty/urban retail centers. 
                
    Apartments   -     owns, acquires and operates residential rental properties, including upscale and middle-market apartments, adaptive re-use developments and subsidized senior housing. 
     The remaining   three   reportable operating segments consist of the following: 
  Development   represents the development and construction of office and life science buildings, regional malls, specialty/urban retail centers, residential rental properties, condominiums and mixed-use projects, along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Development also includes the horizontal development and sale of land to residential, commercial and industrial customers primarily at its   Stapleton   project in Denver, Colorado. 
  Corporate   is comprised of departments providing executive oversight to the entire company and various support services for Operations, Development and Corporate employees. 
  Other   represents the operations of several non-core investments, including the   Barclays Center,   a sports and entertainment arena located in Brooklyn, New York ( Arena ) (sold in January 2016), the Company s equity method investment in the Brooklyn Nets (the  Nets ) (sold in   January 2016  ), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016). 
  Segment Transfers 
  The Development segment includes projects in development, projects under construction along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Projects will be reported in their applicable operating segment (Office, Retail or Apartments) beginning effective January 1 of the year following stabilization. Therefore, the Development segment will continue to report results from recently opened properties until the year-end following initial stabilization. The Company generally defines stabilized properties as being   92%   occupied or having been open and operating for   one   or   two   years, depending on the size of the project. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or any subsequent period. In management s opinion, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented have been included. 
  REIT Conversion 
  On January 13, 2015, the board of directors of Forest City Enterprises, Inc., the Company s predecessor, approved a plan to pursue conversion to real estate investment trust ( REIT ) status. On May 29, 2015, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. formed the Company as a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. On October 20, 2015, the shareholders of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. approved and adopted the merger agreement that implemented the restructuring of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. into a holding company so as to facilitate its conversion to a REIT.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, effective as of 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on December 31, 2015 (the  Effective Time ), (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Forest City Enterprises, Inc., with Forest City Enterprises, Inc. as the surviving corporation, (ii) each outstanding share of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. Class A common stock, par value   $.33 1/3   per share, and Class B common stock, par value   $.33 1/3   per share, automatically converted into   one   share of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. Class A common stock,   $.01   par value per share, and Class B common stock,   $.01   par value per share, respectively, (iii) Forest City Enterprises, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and (iv) the Company became the publicly-traded New York Stock Exchange-listed parent company that succeeded to and continued to operate substantially all of the existing businesses of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries. In addition, each share of Class A common stock of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. held in treasury at December 31, 2015 ceased to be outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger, and a corresponding adjustment was recorded to Class A common stock and additional paid-in capital. Immediately following the merger, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. converted into a Delaware limited partnership named  Forest City Enterprises, L.P.  (the  Operating Partnership ). 
  In this Form 10-Q, unless otherwise specifically stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to  the Company,   Forest City,   we,   our,   us  and similar terms refer to Forest City Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, as of the Effective Time and thereafter. 
  Company Operations 
  As of January 1, 2016, the Company believes it is organized in a manner that enables it to qualify, and intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As such, the Company intends to elect REIT status for its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, upon filing the 2016 Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service on or before September 15, 2017. 
  The Company holds substantially all of its assets, and conducts substantially all of its business, through the Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of September 30, 2016, the Company directly or indirectly owns all of the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. 
  The Company holds and operates certain of its assets through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to applicable corporate income tax. The Company s use of TRSs enables it to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and also allows the Company to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. The primary non-REIT qualified businesses held in TRSs include   461 Dean Street,   an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York  , Pacific Park Brooklyn   project, land development operations,   Barclays Center   arena (sold in January 2016), the Nets (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016). In the future, the Company may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from its TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. Some of the critical estimates include, but are not limited to, determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ( VIEs ), estimates of useful lives for long-lived assets, reserves for collection on accounts and notes receivable, gains on change in control of interests, impairment of real estate and other-than-temporary impairments on equity method investments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined it was the primary beneficiary of   49   VIEs representing   40   consolidated properties. The creditors of the consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the Company s general credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined it was not the primary beneficiary of   61   VIEs and accounts for these interests as equity method investments. The maximum exposure to loss of these unconsolidated VIEs is limited to   $148,000,000  , the Company s investment balances as of   September 30, 2016  . The significant decrease in the maximum exposure to loss of unconsolidated VIEs is a result of an impairment recorded during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase in the number of VIEs along with the increase in the VIE assets and liabilities disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet relate to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance. Prior year VIE disclosures on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were not required to be adjusted. See the New Accounting Guidance section for more information. 
  Reclassifications 
  The Company began presenting new reportable segments during the three months ended September 30, 2016. See the General section for detailed information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.

Concurrent with our internal reorganization, certain functions previously performed within our old business unit structure were centralized into our corporate segment. We analyzed the allocation methodology of these new corporate functions and our historic corporate functions and how it relates to support services provided to our new segments within our new organizational structure. As a result of this analysis, certain expenses previously recorded in the old business units and reported on the property operating and management expenses financial statement line item are recorded in the corporate segment and included in the corporate general and administrative expense financial statement line item. To conform to the current year presentation,   $730,000   and   $2,880,000  , have been reclassed from property operating and management expenses to corporate general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. In addition,   $2,260,000   reported as property operating and management expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was reclassed and is now included in corporate general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  During 2016, the Company established   two   new financial statement line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,  Accounts receivable, net  and  Notes receivable , to report accounts receivable and notes receivable in separate line items. Previously accounts receivable and notes receivable were reported together in the  Notes and accounts receivable, net  financial statement line item. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. 
  Certain prior year amounts related to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. 
  New Accounting Guidance 
  The following accounting pronouncements were adopted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to the consolidation accounting guidance. This guidance changes the required analysis to determine whether certain types of legal entities should be consolidated. The amendment modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and may affect the consolidation analysis of entities involved in VIEs, particularly those having fee arrangements and related party relationships. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. As a result of the adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016, there were   no   changes to the consolidation conclusions of any of our subsidiaries, although   27   additional entities were determined to now be VIEs in accordance with the new accounting guidance. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that third-party debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. As a result of the adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016, the Company reclassified   $47,748,000   of mortgage procurement costs from other assets to nonrecourse mortgage debt and notes payable, net,   $3,771,000   of procurement costs from other assets to convertible senior debt, net and   $18,340,000   of mortgage procurement costs from assets held for sale to liabilities held for sale on the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  The following new accounting pronouncements will be adopted on their respective effective dates: 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of this guidance is an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance defines steps an entity should apply to achieve the core principle. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim reporting periods within that annual period and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company intends to adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective method and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance requires management to assess the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures under certain circumstances. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on leases. This guidance sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The guidance is expected to impact the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company has certain operating and land lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. The new guidance supersedes the previous leases accounting standard. The guidance is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Related Party Transactions 
  The Company and certain of its affiliates entered into a Master Contribution and Sale Agreement (the  Master Contribution Agreement ) with Bruce C. Ratner ( Mr. Ratner ), Executive Vice President and Director, and certain entities and individuals affiliated with Mr. Ratner (the  BCR Entities ) in August 2006 to purchase their interests in a total of   30   retail, office and residential operating properties and service companies in the Greater New York City metropolitan area. The Company issued Class A Common Units ( 2006 Units ) in a jointly-owned, limited liability company in exchange for their interests. The 2006 Units may be exchanged for one of the following forms of consideration at the Company s sole discretion: (i) an equal number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock or, (ii) cash based on a formula using the average closing price of the Class A common stock at the time of conversion or, (iii) a combination of cash and shares of the Company s Class A common stock. The Company has no rights to redeem or repurchase the 2006 Units. Pursuant to the Master Contribution Agreement, certain projects under development would remain owned jointly until each project was completed and achieved  stabilization.  Upon stabilization, each project would be valued and the Company, in its discretion, would choose among various ownership options for the project. In connection with the Master Contribution Agreement, the parties entered into the Tax Protection Agreement (the  Tax Protection Agreement ). The Tax Protection Agreement indemnified the BCR Entities included in the initial closing against taxes payable by reason of any subsequent sale of certain operating properties and expires in November 2018. 
  As a result of the January 2016 sale of   625 Fulton Avenue  , a development site in Brooklyn, New York, the Company accrued   $6,238,000   related to a tax indemnity payment due to the BCR Entities in accordance with the terms of the Tax Protection Agreement. The amount is expected to be paid in quarterly installments during the year ending December 31, 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. The Company paid the first three installments of   $1,560,000   in April, June and September 2016. 
  During 2014, in accordance with the Master Contribution Agreement, the Company accrued and capitalized into the cost basis of the asset an   $11,000,000   development fee payable to Mr. Ratner related to   Westchester s Ridge Hill,   a regional mall in Yonkers, New York, as certain milestones had been reached in the development and operation of the property. The entire amount was included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities at December 31, 2015 and was paid in January 2016. 
  In September 2015, certain BCR Entities exchanged   1,032,402   of the 2006 Units. The Company issued   1,032,402   shares of its Class A common stock for the exchanged 2006 Units. The Company accounted for the exchange as a purchase of noncontrolling interests, resulting in a reduction of noncontrolling interests of   $52,663,000  , an increase to Class A common stock of   $344,000   and a combined increase to additional paid-in capital of   $52,319,000  , accounting for the fair value of common stock issued and the difference between the fair value of consideration exchanged and the historical cost basis of the noncontrolling interest balance. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   1,940,788   of the 2006 Units were outstanding.

Noncontrolling Interest 
  The Company owned an equity interest in   Barclays Center   arena and the Nets through the Company s consolidated subsidiary Nets Sports   Entertainment ( NS E ). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , subsequent to the sale of   Barclays Center   and the Nets, the Company purchased NS E s partners  interest for   $38,951,000  . This cash payment together with the partners  historical  noncontrolling interest debit balance resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.

D  .   Revolving Credit Facility    
  In November 2015, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement which provided for total available borrowings of   $500,000,000   and contains an accordion provision, subject to bank approval, allowing the Company to increase total available borrowings to   $750,000,000   ( Revolving Credit Facility ).  
  In May 2016, the Company exercised a portion of the accordion provision and increased the total available borrowings to   $600,000,000  . 
  The Revolving Credit Facility matures in November 2019, and provides for   two   additional   six  -month extension periods, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings bear interest at the Company s option at either London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) (  0.53%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus a margin of   1.15%   -   1.85%   (  1.25%   at   September 30, 2016  ) or the Prime Rate (  3.50%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus a margin of   0.15%   -   0.85%   (  0.25%   at   September 30, 2016  ). In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to an annual facility fee of   0.20%   -   0.35%   (  0.25%   at   September 30, 2016  ) of total available borrowings. Up to   $150,000,000   of the available borrowings can be used for letters of credit. The applicable margins and annual facility fee are based on the Company s total leverage ratio.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility has restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on certain types of dispositions, mergers, consolidations, and limitations on lines of business the Company is allowed to conduct. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum total leverage ratio, maximum secured and unsecured leverage ratios, maximum secured recourse leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio (all as specified in the Revolving Credit Agreement). At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all of these financial covenants. 
  The following table summarizes available credit on the Revolving Credit Facility: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility of   $3,000,000   and   $3,177,000  , respectively, are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

E  .   Term Loan Facility    
  In May 2016, the Company entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement which provides for a   $335,000,000   senior unsecured term loan credit facility ( Term Loan Facility ) available in up to   three   draws. The availability of the Term Loan Facility terminates on the earliest to occur of (a) November 30, 2016, (b) the date on which the third borrowing (if any) is made, (c) the date the aggregate principal amount of all term loans outstanding equals the total amount of the Term Loan Facility, or (d) the date the aggregate commitments are terminated or reduced to zero.  
  The Term Loan Facility matures on May 4, 2021 and bears interest at the Company s option at either LIBOR plus a margin of   1.30%   -   2.20%   (  1.45%   at   September 30, 2016  ) or the Base Rate plus a margin of   0.30%   -   1.20%   (  0.45%   at   September 30, 2016  ). The applicable margins are based on the Company s total leverage ratio. Upon the Company obtaining an investment grade credit rating, established by certain debt rating agencies for the Company s long term, senior, unsecured non-credit enhanced debt (the  Debt Ratings ), the applicable margin will, at the Company s election, be based on the Company s then-current Debt Ratings. 
  The Term Loan Facility contains identical financial covenants as the Revolving Credit Facility as described in Note   D       Revolving Credit Facility  . Additionally, the Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default provisions, including failure to pay indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy or other insolvency events, which could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, as well as customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. 
  There were   no   borrowings outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at   September 30, 2016  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Facility of   $1,832,000   are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

F  .   Convertible Senior Debt, Net 
  The following table summarizes the convertible senior debt, net: 

All of the senior debt are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness; however, they are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company s subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that other debt. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the Company s convertible senior notes. Under the terms of the agreements, holders agreed to exchange certain notes for either shares of Class A common stock, cash payments or a combination of both. Under the accounting guidance for induced conversions of convertible debt, additional amounts paid to induce the holders to exchange the notes were expensed resulting in a non-tax deductible loss on extinguishment of debt.

The following table summarizes convertible senior debt transactions completed during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

During 2009, in connection with the 2016 Senior Notes issuance, the Company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction intended to reduce, subject to a limit, the potential dilution with respect to the Company s Class A common stock upon conversion of the 2016 Senior Notes. On March 3, 2015, the Company terminated and settled the convertible note hedge and received proceeds of   $17,818,000   and   258,350   shares of Class A common stock. Under the accounting guidance, the total consideration received was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital. 
  Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 
  Holders may convert their   4.250%   Convertible Senior Notes due August 15, 2018 ( 2018 Senior Notes ) at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Initially, upon conversion, a noteholder would have received   46.1425   shares of Class A common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of 2018 Senior Notes ( Conversion Rate ), based on a conversion price of approximately   $21.67   per share of Class A common stock, subject to adjustment. In accordance with the 2018 Senior Note Indenture, the second quarter 2016 cash dividend paid by the Company triggered a required adjustment to the Conversion Rate from   46.1425   shares of Class A common stock to   46.6375   shares of Class A common stock effective as of June 10, 2016, the record date for the second quarter 2016 dividend. The third quarter 2016 dividend did not trigger an additional adjustment, as the amount was below the required threshold. See Note   J       Dividends   for detailed information on the Company s cash dividends. 
  Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 
  Holders may convert their   3.625%     Convertible Senior Notes due August 15, 2020 ( 2020 Senior Notes ) at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Initially, upon conversion, a noteholder would have received   41.3129   shares of Class A common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of 2020 Senior Notes ( Conversion Rate ), based on a conversion price of approximately   $24.21   per share of Class A common stock, subject to adjustment. In accordance with the 2020 Senior Note Indenture, the second quarter 2016 cash dividend paid by the Company triggered a required adjustment to the Conversion Rate from   41.3129   shares of Class A common stock to   41.7561   shares of Class A common stock effective as of June 10, 2016, the record date for the second quarter 2016 dividend. The third quarter 2016 dividend did not trigger an additional adjustment, as the amount was below the required threshold. See Note   J       Dividends   for detailed information on the Company s cash dividends.

G  .   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy using derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned impact on earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. The strategy uses interest rate swaps and caps having indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities. The Company enters into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate long-term debt, and vice-versa, depending on market conditions. Interest rate swaps are generally for periods of   one   to   ten   years. Interest rate caps are generally for periods of   one   to   three   years. The use of interest rate caps is consistent with the Company s risk management objective to reduce or eliminate exposure to variability in future cash flows primarily attributable to increases in interest rates on its floating-rate debt. 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage exposure to interest rate movements. The Company primarily uses interest rate caps and swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated OCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognized directly in earnings. Ineffectiveness was insignificant during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects it will reclassify amounts recorded in accumulated OCI into earnings as an increase in interest expense of approximately   $34,337,000   within the next twelve months. However, the actual amount reclassified could vary due to future changes in the fair value of these derivatives. 
  Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company enters into total rate of return swaps ( TROR ) on various tax-exempt fixed-rate borrowings. The TROR convert borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate. The TROR requires the payment of a variable interest rate, generally equivalent to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) rate (  0.84%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus a spread. Additionally, the Company has guaranteed the fair value of the underlying borrowings. Fluctuation in the value of the TROR is offset by the fluctuation in the value of the underlying borrowings, resulting in minimal financial impact. At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional amount of TROR designated as fair value hedging instruments is   $551,985,000  . The underlying TROR borrowings are subject to a fair value adjustment.

Nondesignated Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company uses derivative contracts to hedge certain interest rate risk, even though the contracts do not qualify for, or the Company has elected not to apply, hedge accounting. In these situations, the derivative is recorded at its fair value with changes reflected in earnings. 
  The Company has certain undesignated TROR where the associated debt is held by an unconsolidated affiliate or unrelated third parties. The change in fair value of these TROR is recognized in earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional amount of these TROR is   $138,564,000  .  
  In instances where the Company enters into separate derivative instruments effectively hedging the same debt for consecutive annual periods, the duplicate amount of notional is excluded from the following disclosure in an effort to provide information that enables the financial statement user to understand the Company s volume of derivative activity.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
  The principal credit risk of the Company s interest rate risk management strategy is the potential inability of a counterparty to cover its obligations. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation, the risk of loss approximates the fair value of the derivative. To mitigate this exposure, the Company generally purchases derivative financial instruments from the financial institution that issues the related debt, from financial institutions with which the Company has other lending relationships, or from financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of AA at the time of the transaction. 
  Agreements with derivative counterparties contain provisions under which the counterparty could terminate the derivative obligations if the Company defaults on its obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and designated conditions are fulfilled. In instances where the Company s subsidiaries have derivative obligations secured by a mortgage, the derivative obligations could be terminated if the indebtedness between the two parties is terminated, either by loan payoff or default of the indebtedness. In addition, certain subsidiaries have agreements containing provisions whereby the subsidiaries must maintain certain minimum financial ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not have any derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features, such as a credit rating downgrade, that may trigger collateral to be posted with a counterparty. 
  The following table summarizes information about collateral posted for derivatives in liability positions as of   September 30, 2016  :

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximates fair value based upon the short-term nature of the instruments. The carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value since the interest rates on these notes approximates current market rates for similar instruments when considering the risk profile and quality of the collateral, if applicable. The Company estimates the fair value of its debt instruments by discounting future cash payments at interest rates the Company believes approximate the current market. Estimated fair value is based upon market prices of public debt, available industry financing data, current treasury rates, recent financing transactions, conversion features on convertible senior debt and loan to value ratios. The fair value of the Company s debt instruments is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following table summarizes the fair value of nonrecourse mortgage debt and notes payable, net, including balances classified as held for sale (exclusive of the fair value of derivatives) and convertible senior debt, net: 

I  .   Capital Stock    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement to exchange the remaining   $125,000   of the 2016 Senior Notes for   9,298   shares of Class A common stock. 
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company issued shares of Class A common stock in connection with the separate, privately negotiated exchange transactions involving a portion of the Company s 2016, 2018 and 2020 Senior Notes. The Company also received shares of Class A common stock in connection with the termination of a convertible note hedge related to the 2016 Senior Notes. See Note   F       Convertible Senior Debt, Net   for detailed information on these transactions. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company issued shares of Class A common stock to certain BCR entities in exchange of Class A Common Units pursuant to the Master Contribution Agreement.

L  .   Write-Offs of Abandoned Development Projects    
  The Company reviews each project under development to determine whether it is probable the project will be developed. If management determines the project will not be developed, its project costs and other related expenses are written off as an abandoned development project cost. The Company abandons projects under development for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction or financing costs or third party challenges related to entitlements or public financing. The Company recorded write-offs of abandoned development projects of   $10,058,000   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $5,778,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.

M  .   Impairment of Real Estate and Impairment of Unconsolidated Entities 
  Impairment of Real Estate 
  The Company reviews its real estate for impairment whenever events or changes indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. In determining whether the carrying costs are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the Company uses various assumptions including future estimated net operating income, estimated holding periods, risk of foreclosure and estimated cash proceeds upon the disposition of the asset. If the carrying costs are not recoverable, the Company records an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value. The assumptions used to estimate fair value, which are based on current information, are Level 2 or 3 inputs. If the conditions deteriorate or if plans regarding the assets change, additional impairment charges may occur in future periods.  
  The following table summarizes the Company s impairment of real estate included in continuing operations: 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company s Board of Directors authorized a process to review strategic alternatives for the Company s retail portfolio. The Company has begun discussions with certain strategic partners and other potential buyers for several of its retail assets. In connection with this review and discussions to date, the Company has updated its impairment analysis on its retail assets, including increasing the likelihood of near-term sales. As a result, the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeded the carrying value of the   Shops at Northfield Stapleton   and   Boulevard Mall,   requiring the Company to adjust the carrying value to their estimated fair value during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company has not entered into any agreements, and can not ensure a transaction can or will be consummated and therefore, such assets continue to be classified as held in use. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company decided to pursue the partial sale, through a joint venture, of   Shops at Wiregrass  . At March 31, 2016, negotiations and buyer due diligence were substantially complete and closing of the transaction remained subject to receipt of a third party consent, which remained outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . The advanced status of the transaction at March 31, 2016 triggered management to further update its undiscounted cash flow analysis including its probability weighted estimated holding period. As a result, the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeded the carrying value, requiring the Company to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company closed on the disposition of   49%   of its equity interest in October 2016. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , based on the loss of a potential tenant to fill a significant vacancy, the Company updated its undiscounted cash flow analysis including its probability weighted estimated holding period for   Post Office Plaza   office building. As a result, the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeded the carrying value, requiring the Company to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company continues to market all of the operating assets at   Illinois Science   Technology Park   in Skokie, Illinois. During 2015, the Company had several interested parties at pricing that approximated the carrying value of the assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the high bidder withdrew their offer and certain market conditions, including the loss of possible redevelopment incentives, negatively impacted the pricing from other interested parties. At September 30, 2015, discussions with a potential purchaser were ongoing and remained subject to further negotiation. Based on these factors, the Company increased the likelihood of a near-term sale and reduced the pricing in such scenario in its estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows. As a result, these estimated undiscounted cash flows no longer exceed the carrying value of the assets, requiring the Company to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, discussions with the potential buyer ceased, as mutually agreeable terms could not be reached.

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company received a letter of intent for the operating assets at   Illinois Science   Technology Park  . Based on the letter of intent pricing, the Company updated its undiscounted cash flow analysis resulting in the estimated undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeding the carrying value of the assets, requiring the Company to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2015  , the Company owned   13.5   acres of land located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is included in land inventory on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company had been marketing the land for sale for over twelve months without closing a sale of any of the parcels. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, it became evident the expected sale price was less than originally estimated and lower than its carrying value. At   September 30, 2015  , the Company had a letter of intent for a portion of the land and continued to market the remaining parcels. Using the letter of intent pricing, in addition to other information gathered from other market participants, including verbal bids, the Company adjusted its estimated selling price, less cost to sell, of this land, which was less than its carrying value. As such, the Company recorded an impairment charge of   $16,307,000   during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold   6.1   acres of the land at amounts that approximated the carrying value. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement for the remaining parcels. As a result, the Company adjusted its estimated selling price, less costs to sell and recorded an impairment charge of   $1,230,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company decided to pursue the partial sale, through a joint venture, of   Westchester's Ridge Hill  . At September 30, 2015, discussions with a potential joint venture partner were ongoing and remained subject to further negotiation and applicable due diligence periods. The advanced status of the discussions triggered management to update its undiscounted cash flow analysis including its probability weighted estimated holding period. As a result, the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeded the carrying value, requiring the Company to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company closed on the disposition of   51%   of its equity interest in January 2016. See Note   S       Net Gain on Disposition of Full or Partial Interest in Rental Properties, Net of Tax   for detailed information on the transaction. 
  Impairment of Unconsolidated Entities 
  The Company reviews its portfolio of unconsolidated entities for other-than-temporary impairments whenever events or changes indicate its carrying value in the investments may be in excess of fair value. An equity method investment s value is impaired if management s estimate of its fair value is less than the carrying value and the difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. In estimating fair value, assumptions that may be used include comparable sale prices, market discount rates, market capitalization rates and estimated future discounted cash flows specific to the geographic region and property type, all of which are considered Level 3 inputs. For recently opened properties, assumptions also include the timing of initial property lease up. In the event initial property lease up assumptions differ from actual results, estimated future discounted cash flows may vary, resulting in impairment charges in future periods. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s impairment of unconsolidated entities: 

Pacific Park Brooklyn   is a   22   acre mixed-use project in Brooklyn, New York. On June 30, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture with Greenland Atlantic Yards, LLC, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based Greenland Holding Group Company Limited ( Greenland ) to develop the project. Under the joint venture, Greenland acquired   70%   of the project and agreed to co-develop the project with the Company, along with sharing in the entire project costs going forward in proportion to ownership interests. The joint venture was formed to execute on the remaining development rights, including the infrastructure and vertical construction of the residential units, but excluded   Barclay s Center   and   461 Dean Street   apartment community. Consistent with the approved master plan, the joint venture agreed to develop the remaining portion of Phase I and all of Phase II of the project, including the permanent rail yard. At the time of closing, the remaining portion of Phase I included   seven   buildings, totaling approximately   3.1 million   square feet. Phase II consists of   seven   buildings totaling approximately   3.3 million   square feet and further obligations to complete significant additional infrastructure improvements including a platform over the permanent rail yard.

Upon closing of the partial sale on June 30, 2014, it was determined the Company was not the primary beneficiary of the joint venture and the entity was deconsolidated and subsequently accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The transaction resulted in net cash proceeds of   $208,275,000  . The basis of the investment at the time approximated fair value as supported by the sales price and underlying discounted cash flow model used by both parties to underwrite the transaction. Due to the nature of the project in terms of size, duration and complexity, the underlying discounted cash flow model included many estimates and assumptions of future events. Key estimates in the discounted cash flow model include horizontal infrastructure costs including, among other things, estimates of completing the permanent rail yard and the platform over the rail yard, rent growth in the rental buildings and sales prices for condo buildings, trade costs for vertical construction, timing of starting vertical construction and opening buildings, terminal cap rates and the underlying discount rate. 
  The joint venture broke ground on the first affordable apartment community,   535 Carlton  , in December, 2014. In mid-2015, the joint venture commenced construction on   two   more buildings,   38 Sixth Avenue  , an affordable apartment building, and   550 Vanderbilt,   a condominium building. From the formation of the joint venture in June 2014 through the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company reviewed the estimates and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model and updated them as necessary. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, it became evident the occupancy and rental rate declines in the Brooklyn market was determined not to be temporary as a result of an increased supply of new rental product amplified by the sun-setting and the uncertainty around the 421 A real estate tax abatement program. Over the last quarter, the condominium market in New York has also softened, causing the projected sale schedule for   550 Vanderbilt   to be adjusted accordingly. Separately, the construction costs across the New York market continue to trend upward, resulting in increases in the estimated trade costs for certain infrastructure as well as vertical construction. In addition, the expiration of and the continued uncertainty related to the availability of the 421 A real estate tax abatement program puts further stress on anticipated returns. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as part of the Company s formal strategic plan update, a decision was made to revise the overall project schedule for   Pacific Park Brooklyn  . Accordingly, the Company updated the discounted cash flow model to reflect the updated timing of the project schedule as well as the revenue, expense and cost assumptions. Based on the above, the estimated fair value of the investment no longer exceeded the carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of   $299,300,000   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining basis in the investment (net of estimated future funding obligations) is not material.

N  .   Gains on Change in Control of Interests    
  The following table summarizes the gains on change in control of interests. 

Apartment Communities 
  In April 2015, the Company acquired its partner s   50%   equity ownership interest in   three   operating apartment communities (  Cherry Tree,     Chestnut Lake   and   Stratford Crossing)   in exchange for the Company s   50%   equity ownership in   five   operating apartment communities (  Arbor Glen, Eaton Ridge, Newport Landing, Parkwood Village   and   Sutton Landing  ) in a non-cash transaction. Subsequent to the transaction, the Company owns   100%   of the   three   retained operating apartment communities. See Note   P     Net Gain on Disposition of Interest in Unconsolidated Entities   for d  etailed information on the net gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated entities related to the   five   operating apartment communities exchanged. 
  University Park at MIT 
  In June 2015, the Company completed the share purchase and redemption agreement with its partner to acquire the partner s   49%   equity ownership interest in   seven   life science office properties and   two   parking facilities at   University Park at MIT  , a mixed-use life science office campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts ( MIT Assets )  .   The Company used   $386,156,000   of the net proceeds from the May 2015 equity offering to finance this acquisition. See Note   I       Capital Stock   for detailed information on the equity offering. 
  Prior to the acquisition, the Company owned   51%   and had accounted for the MIT Assets using the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the transaction, the Company owns   100%   of these assets and has concluded it appropriate to consolidate the assets. As a result, the Company remeasured its equity interests, as required by the accounting guidance, at fair value (based upon the income approach using current rents and market cap rates and discount rates) and recorded a gain on change in control of interests as noted above. 
  The fair value of the acquisition was allocated as follows. All amounts are presented in thousands. 

(3) 
    The significant assumptions used to value the previously held equity interests in the MIT Assets were determined to be Level 3 inputs. The weighted-average discount rate applied to cash flows and the weighted-average terminal capitalization rate were   7.0%   and   6.0%  , respectively.

Pro Forma Information 
  The following unaudited supplemental pro forma operating data is presented for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as if the step acquisition related to the MIT Assets was effective January 1, 2014. The gain on change in control of interests related to this acquisition was adjusted to the assumed acquisition date. The unaudited supplemental pro forma operating data is not necessarily indicative of what the Company s actual results of operations would have been assuming the transactions had been effective as set forth above, nor do they purport to represent the Company s results of operations for future periods. The qualitative and quantitative effect to the pro forma operating data related to the remaining acquisitions described in the table above was not material. 

(2) 
    Represents additional depreciation and amortization expense related to the increased basis of real estate and intangible assets, plus pro forma earnings of the   100%   ownership interests, less actual equity in earnings related to the Company s   51%   prior ownership for the period presented. 

O  .   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $0   and   $29,084,000  , respectively, as loss on extinguishment of debt. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $23,609,000   and   $61,953,000  , respectively, as loss on extinguishment of debt. The losses on extinguishment of debt recorded primarily relates to separate, privately negotiated exchange transactions involving a portion of the Company s 2016, 2018 and 2020 Senior Notes. See Note   F       Convertible Senior Debt, Net   for detailed information on these non-tax deductible losses on extinguishment of debt. 

P  .   Net Gain on Disposition of Interest in Unconsolidated Entities 
  The following table summarizes the net gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated entities which are included in earnings (loss)from unconsolidated entities. 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company sold its entire ownership interest in   Steinway Street Theaters  , an unconsolidated specialty retail center in Queens, New York. The disposition resulted in net cash proceeds of   $14,059,000  .

In April 2015, the Company acquired its partner s   50%   equity ownership interest in   three   operating apartment communities (  Cherry Tree,     Chestnut Lake   and   Stratford Crossing)   in exchange for the Company s   50%   equity ownership in   five   operating apartment communities (  Arbor Glen, Eaton Ridge, Newport Landing, Parkwood Village   and   Sutton Landing  ) in a non-cash transaction. As a result, the Company recorded gains on disposition of interest in unconsolidated entities as noted above during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . See Note   N       Gains on Change in Control of Interests   for d  etailed information on the three retained operating apartment communities. 

Q  .   Income Taxes    
  The Company has filed for the prior taxable years a consolidated United States federal tax return, which includes all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. For its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, the Company intends to file as a REIT, which it will accomplish by filing the 2016 Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service on or before September 15, 2017. The Company s TRSs will file as C corporations. The Company also files individual separate income tax returns in various states. 
  The Company is required to annually distribute to its shareholders an amount equal to at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gain and net of any available net operating losses). The Company may be subject to certain state gross income and franchise taxes, as well as taxes on any undistributed income and federal and state corporate taxes on any income earned by its TRSs. In addition, the Company could be subject to corporate income taxes related to assets held by the REIT which are sold during the   five   year period following the date of conversion, to the extent such sold assets had a built-in gain on the date of conversion. 
  Income tax expense was   $525,000   and   $2,167,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company did not recognize any federal corporate income tax on its earnings in the REIT. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reversed   $83,645,000   of deferred tax assets associated with the Military Housing,   Westchester s Ridge Hill  , the Nets and   Barclays Center   disposals. 
  Income tax (benefit) expense was   $(163,814,000)   and   $23,739,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, as the Company was taxed as a C corporation. The difference in recorded income tax expense/benefit versus income tax expense/benefit computed at the statutory federal income tax rate is primarily attributable to state income taxes, changes in state net operating losses, additional general business credits, changes to valuation allowances associated with certain deferred tax assets, and various permanent differences between pre-tax GAAP income and taxable income. 
  At   December 31, 2015  , the TRS had a federal net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes of   $54,822,000   available to use on its tax return expiring in the years ending December 31, 2029 through 2035, a charitable contribution deduction carryforward of   $913,000   expiring in the years ending December 31, 2016 through 2019 and general business credit carryovers of   $125,000   expiring in the years ending December 31, 2027 through 2035. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of   $282,758,000   available to use on its REIT tax return expiring in the years ending December 31, 2029 through 2035. 

R  .   Net Gain on Disposition of Interest in Development Project    
  In January 2016, the Company completed the sale of   625 Fulton Avenue  , a development site in Brooklyn, New York. The transaction resulted in net cash proceeds of   $151,776,000  , of which   $93,776,000   was received at closing and the remaining   $58,000,000   was received during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Company recorded a net pre-tax gain on disposition of interest in development project of   $136,687,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

S  .   Net Gain on Disposition of Full or Partial Interest in Rental Properties, Net of Tax 
  The following table summarizes the net gain (loss) on disposition of full or partial interest in rental properties, net of tax: 

(1) 
    Primarily represents non-cash deferred taxes recognized upon the reversal of the deferred tax asset used to offset the taxable gain on the sales of assets held by the TRS. 
     The income tax effect on the net gain on disposition of full or partial interest in rental properties, net of tax primarily relates to the deferred taxes recognized upon the partial disposition of   Westchester s Ridge Hill,   a formerly wholly owned regional mall in Yonkers, New York, and the disposal of military housing entities, as these assets were held by our TRS and remained subject to federal income tax. 
  Terminal Tower 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company completed the sale of   Terminal Tower  , an office building in Cleveland, Ohio. The Company s corporate headquarters is located in the   Terminal Tower   and the Company is currently evaluating options to relocate its headquarters in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into an 18 month lease agreement, (minimum initial term) with various options to extend up to 48 months, to provide the Company the necessary time to evaluate and relocate its corporate headquarters. While the Company transferred all risks and rewards of ownership of the property to the buyer, the Company s expected estimated lease term resulted in more than a minor, but less then substantially all of the use of the asset through the leaseback transaction. As a result, the Company deferred   $7,917,000   which will be amortized as an offset to rent expense over the lease term, and recorded a net gain on disposition of   $14,391,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The sale generated net cash proceeds of   $38,027,000  . 
  Military Housing 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company completed the sale of its interests in entities that develop and manage military family housing. The sale generated net cash proceeds of   $208,305,000  . These entities were primarily service providers generating fee revenue. The primary assets acquired by the buyer were intangible assets of approximately   $29,000,000   and investments in unconsolidated entities, net, of approximately   $14,600,000  . 
  QIC Joint Venture 
  Westchester s Ridge Hill 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with outside partners, affiliated entities of QIC, one of the largest institutional investment managers in Australia. The outside partner invested in and received   51%   of our equity interests in   Westchester s Ridge Hill.   The Company received net cash proceeds of   $75,448,000   along with the buyer assuming debt of   $169,369,000  , representing   51%   of the nonrecourse mortgage debt of the property. Based on the amount of cash received, the outside partner s minimum initial investment requirement was met and the transaction qualified for full gain recognition related to the partial sale. The property is adequately capitalized and does contain the characteristics of a VIE. Based on the substantive participating rights in all significant decision making areas held by the outside partner with regards to the joint venture, the Company concluded it appropriate to deconsolidate the entity and account for it under the equity method of accounting.

Ballston Quarter 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company formed and entered into a new joint venture with outside partners, affiliated entities of QIC. The Company contributed its equity interest in   Ballston Quarter  , a formerly wholly owned regional mall in Arlington, Virginia, and certain residential development rights to the new joint venture. The outside partner invested   $36,269,000   of cash directly into the new joint venture and assumed debt of   $20,825,000  , representing   49%   of the nonrecourse mortgage debt of the property. The transaction does not meet the requirements to be recognized as a sale for accounting purposes as the Company formed and entered into a new joint venture and has a commitment to re-invest its entire cash proceeds received from the sale as a part of a major redevelopment plan of the asset. Upon closing, the entity was deemed to have insufficient equity and was assessed for consolidation purposes using the VIE model. Based on this and the substantive participating rights in all significant decision making areas of the outside partner, the Company concluded it appropriate to deconsolidate the entity and account for its interest under the equity method of accounting at historical cost. 
  Johns Hopkins Parking Garage 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company sold the top   five   floors of the   Johns Hopkins Parking Garage   located in Baltimore, Maryland which generated   $11,186,000   in cash proceeds. 

T  .   Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations    
  In October 2016, the Company completed the sale of   Grand Lowry Lofts  , an apartment community in Denver, Colorado, which met the requirements to be classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016.  
  On January 29, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its   55%   ownership interest in   Barclays Center   and   20%   equity method ownership interest in the Nets (collectively, the  Disposal Group ). The sales price for our equity interest in   Barclays Center   was   $162,600,000  , generating net cash proceeds of   $60,924,000   and a note receivable of   $92,600,000  , which bears interest at   4.50%   per annum payable semi-annually and matures in 2019. In addition, the buyer assumed the gross debt that amounted to   $457,745,000  . The sales price for our equity interest in the Nets was   $125,100,000   payable entirely in the form of a note receivable, which bears interest at   4.50%   per annum payable at maturity and matures in 2021. 
  The Disposal Group met the requirements to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015 and qualifies to be reported as discontinued operations. Additionally, a development opportunity, comprised of land at   625 Fulton Avenue  , in Brooklyn, New York, which the Company sold on January 13, 2016,   met the requirements to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015  .

U  .   Earnings Per Share 
  The Company s restricted stock is considered a participating security pursuant to the two-class method for computing earnings per share ( EPS ). The 2006 Class A Common Units ( 2006 Units ), which are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are considered convertible participating securities as they are entitled to participate in dividends paid to the Company s common shareholders. The 2006 Units are included in the computation of basic EPS using the two-class method and are included in the computation of diluted EPS using the if-converted method. The Class A common stock issuable in connection with conversion of the 2016 Senior Notes, 2018 Senior Notes and 2020 Senior Notes is included in the computation of diluted EPS using the if-converted method. The loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was allocated solely to holders of common stock as the participating security holders do not share in losses. 
  The reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS computations is shown in the following table: 

V  .   Segment Information 
  The Company recently completed an internal reorganization and are presenting reportable segments based on this new structure beginning with the reporting period ending September 30, 2016. The new structure is organized around the Company s real estate operations, real estate development and corporate support service functions. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period s reportable segment presentation. 
  Real Estate Operations represents the performance of the Company s core rental real estate portfolio and is comprised of the following   three   reportable operating segments: 
             
    Office   - owns, acquires and operates office and life science buildings. 
                
    Retail   -     owns, acquires and operates regional malls and specialty/urban retail centers. 
                
    Apartments   -     owns, acquires and operates residential rental properties, including upscale and middle-market apartments, adaptive re-use developments and subsidized senior housing. 
     The remaining   three   reportable operating segments consist of the following:

Segment Transfers 
  The Development segment includes projects in development, projects under construction along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Projects will be reported in their applicable operating segment (Office, Retail or Apartments) beginning effective January 1 of the year following stabilization. Therefore, the Development segment will continue to report results from recently opened properties until the year-end following initial stabilization. The Company generally defines stabilized properties as being   92%   occupied or having been open and operating for   one   or   two   years, depending on the size of the project.

The Company uses Adjusted     Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization     ("EBITDA") to report its operating results by segment. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net earnings excluding the following items at the Company's ownership:   i) non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization; ii) interest expense; iii) amortization of mortgage procurement costs; iv) income taxes; v) impairment of real estate; vi) gains or losses from extinguishment of debt; vii) gain (loss) on full or partial disposition of rental properties, development projects and other investments; viii) gains or losses on change in control of interests; ix) other transactional items, including REIT conversion, reorganization costs and termination benefits; and x) the Nets pre-tax EBITDA. 
  The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure to assess operating performance by segment as it represents ongoing key operating components of each segment without regard to how the business is financed. The Company s Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, uses Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, to assess performance of the Company s real estate assets by reportable operating segment because it provides information on the financial performance of the core real estate portfolio operations, development, corporate general and administrative expenses and interest and other income derived from the Company's investments. Adjusted EBITDA measures the profitability of each real estate segment in operations based on the process of collecting rent and paying operating expenses and represents the equivalent of Net Operating Income ( NOI ), as all properly level interest expense is reported in the Corporate segment. NOI by operating segment is discussed in the Net Operating Income section of the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) of this Form 10-Q. For the development segment, adjusted EBITDA measures the profitability of our land development sales activity and any recently opened unstabilized properties, offset by development expenses that do not qualify for capitalization. Interest expense is monitored and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker on an overall company-wide basis and is not a factor in evaluating individual segment performance. The reconciliations of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA by segment are shown in the following tables. All amounts are presented in thousands.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes thereto contained in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Corporate Description 
  We principally engage in the operation, development, management and acquisition of commercial and residential real estate and land throughout the United States. We have approximately   $8.6 billion   of consolidated assets in 20 states and the District of Columbia at   September 30, 2016  . Our core markets include Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the greater metropolitan areas of New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C. We have regional offices in Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and our corporate headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. 
  We recently completed an internal reorganization and are presenting reportable segments based on this new structure beginning with the reporting period ending September 30, 2016. The new structure is organized around our real estate operations, real estate development and corporate support service functions. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period s reportable segment presentation. 
  Real Estate Operations represents the performance of our core rental real estate portfolio and is comprised of the following three reportable operating segments: 
             
    Office   - owns, acquires and operates office and life science buildings. 
                
    Retail   -     owns, acquires and operates regional malls and specialty/urban retail centers. 
                
    Apartments   -     owns, acquires and operates residential rental properties, including upscale and middle-market apartments, adaptive re-use developments and subsidized senior housing. 
     The remaining three reportable operating segments consist of the following: 
  Development   represents the development and construction of office and life science buildings, regional malls, specialty/urban retail centers, residential rental properties, condominiums and mixed-use projects, along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Development also includes the horizontal development and sale of land to residential, commercial and industrial customers primarily at our   Stapleton   project in Denver, Colorado. 
  Corporate   is comprised of departments providing executive oversight to the entire company and various support services for Operations, Development and Corporate employees. 
  Other   represents the operations of several non-core investments, including the   Barclays Center,   a sports and entertainment arena located in Brooklyn, New York ( Arena ) (sold in January 2016), our equity method investment in the Brooklyn Nets (the  Nets ) (sold in   January 2016  ), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016).  
  Segment Transfers 
  The Development segment includes projects in development, projects under construction along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Projects will be reported in their applicable operating segment (Office, Retail or Apartments) beginning effective January 1 of the year following stabilization. Therefore, the Development segment will continue to report results from recently opened properties until the year-end following initial stabilization. We generally define stabilized properties as being 92% occupied or having been open and operating for one or two years, depending on the size of the project.  
  Significant milestones during the   third   quarter of   2016   include: 
             
    Announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a process to review strategic alternatives for our retail portfolio. We intend to look at a range of options and expect the review process to be concluded by the first quarter of 2017; 
                
    Completed the sale of   Terminal Tower,   an office building in Cleveland, Ohio. The sale generated net cash proceeds of   $38,027,000  ; 
                
    Declared and paid a $0.06 per share cash dividend on our Class A and Class B common stock for the third quarter of 2016; 
                
    Opened   461 Dean Street   and   The Bixby  , apartment communities in Brooklyn, New York and Washington, D.C., respectively; 
                
    Completed the phased opening of   Kapolei Lofts  , an apartment community in Kapolei, Hawaii; and 
      
   37 

     Table of Contents  

In addition, subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we achieved the following significant milestones: 
             
    Entered into a new joint venture agreement with outside partners, affiliated entities of QIC, one of the largest institutional investment managers in Australia. The outside partner invested in and received   49%   of our equity interests in   Shops at Wiregrass  , a formerly wholly owned regional mall in Tampa, Florida and a development opportunity adjacent to the   Shops at Wiregrass  . We received net cash proceeds of approximately   $25,300,000   along with the buyer assuming debt of   $40,497,000  , representing   49%   of the nonrecourse mortgage debt of the property; and 
                
    Completed the sale of   Grand Lowry Lofts  , an apartment community in Denver, Colorado. The sale generated net cash proceeds of approximately   $22,900,000  .  
      
  Net Operating Income 
  Net Operating Income ( NOI ), a non-GAAP measure, reflects our share of the core operations of our rental real estate portfolio, prior to any financing activity. NOI is defined as revenues less operating expenses of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Office, Retail, Apartments and Development segments, except for revenues and cost of sales associated with sales of land held in these segments. The activities of our Corporate and Other segments do not involve the operations of our rental property portfolio and therefore are not included in NOI.  
  We believe NOI provides important information about our core operations and, along with earnings before income taxes, is necessary to understand our business and operating results. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, revenues and cost of sales associated with sales of land, other non-property income and losses, and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial and residential real estate and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing a perspective on operations not immediately apparent from net income. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance on a portfolio basis since NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that factors such as occupancy levels, lease structure, rental rates, and tenant mix have on our financial results. Investors can use NOI as supplementary information to evaluate our business. In addition, management believes NOI provides useful information to the investment community about our financial and operating performance when compared to other REITs since NOI is generally recognized as a standard measure of performance in the real estate industry. NOI is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, our GAAP measures, and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.

Comparable NOI  
  We use comparable NOI as a metric to evaluate the performance of our multifamily, office and retail properties. This measure provides a same-store comparison of operating results of all stabilized properties that are open and operating in all periods presented. Non-capitalizable development costs and unallocated management and service company overhead are not directly attributable to an individual operating property and are considered non-comparable NOI. In addition, certain income and expense items at the property level, such as lease termination income, real estate tax assessments or rebates, certain litigation expenses incurred and any related legal settlements and NOI impacts of changes in ownership percentages, are excluded from comparable NOI. Retained properties in lease-up or are otherwise considered non-comparable are disclosed in the Segment Operating Results of the MD A of this Form 10-Q. Other properties and activities such as Arena, federally assisted housing, military housing, straight-line rent adjustments and participation payments as a result of refinancing transactions are not evaluated on a comparable basis and the NOI from these properties and activities is considered non-comparable NOI. 
  Comparable NOI is an operating statistic defined as NOI from stabilized properties operated in all periods presented, net of noncontrolling interests. Comparable NOI is useful because it measures the performance of the same properties on a period-to-period basis and is used to assess operating performance and resource allocation of the operating properties. While property dispositions, acquisitions or other factors impact net earnings in the short term, we believe comparable NOI presents a more consistent view of the overall performance of our operating portfolio from period to period. 
  The following is a reconciliation of comparable NOI to total NOI. 

(1) 
    Includes straight-line rent adjustments, participation payments as a result of refinancing transactions on our properties and unallocated management and service company overhead on our operating properties. 
              (2) 
    Includes straight-line adjustments, non-capitalizable costs and development overhead on our development projects.

FFO 
  Funds From Operations ( FFO ), along with net earnings, provides additional information about our core operations. While property dispositions, acquisitions or other factors impact net earnings in the short-term, we believe FFO presents a more consistent view of the overall financial performance of our business from period-to-period since the core of our business is the recurring operations of our portfolio of real estate assets. Management believes that the exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of the Company s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and impairment of depreciable real estate, management believes that FFO, along with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete measurement of the Company s performance relative to its competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide. 
  The majority of our peers in the publicly traded real estate industry are REITs and report operations using FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). Although we were not a REIT for the prior period presented, management believes it is important to publish this measure to allow for easier comparison of our performance to our peers. The major difference between us and our REIT peers is that we were a taxable entity and any taxable income we generated could have resulted in payment of federal or state income taxes. Our REIT peers typically do not pay federal or state income taxes on their qualified REIT investments, but distribute a significant portion of their taxable income to shareholders. Due to our effective tax management policies, we have not historically been a significant payer of income taxes. This has allowed us to retain our internally generated cash flows but has also resulted in large expenses for deferred taxes as required by GAAP. 
  FFO is defined by NAREIT as net earnings excluding the following items at our ownership: i) gain (loss) on full or partial disposition of rental properties, divisions and other investments (net of tax); ii) non-cash charges for real estate depreciation and amortization; iii) impairment of depreciable real estate (net of tax); and iv) cumulative or retrospective effect of change in accounting principle (net of tax). 
  The table below reconciles net earnings (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, a non-GAAP measure.

(1) 
    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the effect of 8,157,781 shares of dilutive securities was not included in the computation of diluted FFO per share because their effect is anti-dilutive due to the negative FFO for the quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, weighted-average shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt of 6,873,490 were not included in the computation of diluted FFO per share because their effect is anti-dilutive under the if-converted method. As a result, adjustments to FFO are not required for interest expense of $1,141,000 and $4,671,000 for the three and nine months September 30, 2016, respectively, related to these securities.

Operating FFO 
  In addition to reporting FFO, we report Operating FFO as an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe it is appropriate to adjust FFO for significant items driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets, rather than factors specific to the on-going operating performance of our properties. We use Operating FFO as an indicator of continuing operating results in planning and executing our business strategy. Operating FFO should not be considered to be an alternative to net earnings computed under GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
  We define Operating FFO as FFO adjusted to exclude: i) impairment of non-depreciable real estate; ii) write-offs of abandoned development projects and demolition costs; iii) income recognized on state and federal historic and other tax credits; iv) gains or losses from extinguishment of debt; v) change in fair market value of nondesignated hedges; vi) gains or losses on change in control of interests; vii) the adjustment to recognize rental revenues and rental expense using the straight-line method; viii) participation payments to ground lessors on refinancing of our properties; ix) other transactional items; x) the Nets pre-tax FFO; and xi) income taxes on FFO.

Operations 
    
  Office and Retail 
  Comparable leased occupancy is   95.1%   and   94.3%   for office and retail, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   compared with   96.7%   and   93.8%  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2015  . Leased occupancy percentage is calculated by dividing the sum of the total tenant occupied space under the lease and vacant space under lease by total gross leasable area ( GLA ). Retail and office occupancy as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   represents leased occupancy at the end of the quarter. Occupancy data includes leases with original terms of one year or less. Comparable occupancy relates to stabilized properties opened and operated in both the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  We monitor office and retail leases expiring in the short to mid-term. Management s plan to obtain lease renewals for expiring retail and office leases includes signing of lease extensions, if available, and active marketing for available or soon to be available space to new or existing tenants in the normal course of business. 
  Office Buildings 
  The following table represents those new leases and GLA signed on the same space in which there was a former tenant and existing tenant renewals along with all other new leases signed within the rolling 12-month period. 

Retail Centers 
  The following tables represent those new leases and GLA signed and rent per square foot ( SF ) on the same space in which there was a former tenant and existing tenant renewals.

Apartments 
  Comparable economic occupancy for Apartments is   94.5%   and   95.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. Economic residential occupancy is calculated by dividing gross potential rent ( GPR ) less vacancy by GPR. GPR is calculated based on actual rents per lease agreements for occupied apartment units and at market rents for vacant apartment units. Market rental rates are determined using a variety of factors which include availability of specific apartment unit types (one bedroom, two bedroom, etc.), seasonality factors and rents offered by competitive properties for similar apartment types in the same geographic market. Comparable economic occupancy relates to stabilized properties that operated in both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  The following tables present leasing information of our apartment communities. Prior period amounts may differ from data as reported in previous quarters since the properties that qualify as comparable change from period to period.

    500 Sterling Place  , an apartment community in Brooklyn, New York, was acquired (Q1-2015) and is classified as a non-comparable property. 
              (2) 
    Effective April 1, 2016,   Ballston Quarter  , a regional mall in Arlington, Virginia, changed from the full consolidation method of accounting to the equity method of accounting. The decreases in revenues, operating expenses and interest expense relate to the period prior to the consolidation change while the change in equity in earnings relates to the period subsequent.   Ballston Quarter   is classified as a non-comparable property due to its upcoming planned redevelopment project. 
          
  Office   - Quarterly Comparison    
  The decreases in revenues and operating expenses related to recent disposals are due to our ongoing strategy to sell operating assets in non-core markets. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our recent reorganization, as well as the centralization of certain functions now performed at Corporate and reported as Corporate expenses. 
  Retail   - Quarterly Comparison    
  The decreases in revenues and operating expenses along with the increase in equity in earnings related to the change in consolidation method are due to the change from full consolidation to equity method accounting upon the formation of a joint venture with an outside partner for   Westchester s Ridge Hill   (Q1-2016). The decreases in revenues and operating expenses related to recent disposals are due to our ongoing strategy to sell operating assets in non-core markets.  
  Apartments   - Quarterly Comparison 
  The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our recent reorganization, as well as the centralization of certain functions now performed at Corporate and reported as Corporate expenses. 
  Development   - Quarterly Comparison

Corporate   - Quarterly Comparison    
  The decrease in REIT conversion, reorganization costs and termination benefits is a result of the transactional nature of these project costs. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily due to outside consulting costs and increased general and administrative costs as a result of certain functions being centralized as a result of the recent reorganization and now reported as Corporate expenses that were previously recorded in the Office, Retail, Apartments and Development segments. The equity in earnings (loss) reported in the Corporate segment relates solely to interest expense on our equity method investments, as all interest expense is reported in the Corporate segment.  
  Other     - Quarterly Comparison 
  The fluctuations in revenues, operating expenses and equity in earnings related to recent disposals are due to the sale of our interests in entities that develop and manage military family housing (Q1-2016).

Office     - Year-to-Date Comparison    
  The increases in revenues and operating expenses along with the decrease in equity in earnings related to the change in consolidation method are due to the change from equity method to full consolidation method of accounting for the MIT Assets (Q2-2015) upon the acquisition of our partner s equity interests in those properties. The decreases in revenues and operating expenses related to recent disposals are due to our ongoing strategy to sell operating assets in non-core markets. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our recent reorganization, as well as the centralization of certain functions now performed at Corporate and reported as Corporate expenses. 
  Retail     - Year-to-Date Comparison 
  The decreases in revenues and operating expenses along with the increase in equity in earnings related to the change in consolidation method are due to the change from full consolidation to equity method accounting upon the formation of a joint venture with an outside partner for   Westchester s Ridge Hill   (Q1-2016). The decreases in revenues and operating expenses related to recent disposals are due to our ongoing strategy to sell operating assets in non-core markets. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our recent reorganization, as well as the centralization of certain functions now performed at Corporate and reported as Corporate expenses. 
  Apartments     - Year-to-Date Comparison 
  The increases in revenues and operating expenses and decrease in equity in earnings related to the change in consolidation method are due to the change from equity method to full consolidation method of accounting for three operating apartment communities located in Northeast Ohio     (Q2-2015) upon the acquisition of our partner s 50% equity interests. The increase in equity in earnings for other is primarily related to a $10,191,000 write-off of abandoned development projects of unconsolidated entities that occurred in 2015 with no such charge in 2016. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our recent reorganization, as well as the centralization of certain functions now performed at Corporate and reported as Corporate expenses. 
  Development   - Year-to-Date Comparison 
  The increase in other revenues relates to a $5,500,000 development fee related to the redevelopment project of   Ballston Quarter  , recognized upon achievement of certain milestones on the project. 
  Corporate     - Year-to-Date Comparison  
  The decrease in REIT conversion, reorganization costs and termination benefits is a result of the transactional nature of these project costs. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily due to outside consulting costs and increased general and administrative costs as a result of certain functions being centralized as a result of the recent reorganization and now reported as Corporate expenses that were previously recorded in the Office, Retail, Apartments and Development segments. The equity in earnings (loss) reported in the Corporate segment relates solely to interest expense on our equity method investments, as all interest expense is reported in the Corporate segment.  
  Other     - Year-to-Date Comparison  
  The fluctuations in revenues, operating expenses and equity in earnings related to recent disposals are due to the sale of our interests in entities that develop and manage military family housing (Q1-2016). 

Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $62,892,000   and   $188,521,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $71,155,000   and   $180,379,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to the change from full consolidation to equity method accounting upon the formation of a joint venture with an outside partner for   Westchester s Ridge Hill   (Q1-2016). The   increase   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to the change from equity method accounting to full consolidation for the MIT Assets (Q2-2015) partially offset by the change from full consolidation to equity method accounting upon the formation of a joint venture with an outside partner for   Westchester s Ridge Hill   (Q1-2016).

Impairment of Real Estate and Impairment of Unconsolidated Entities 
  Impairment of Real Estate 
  The following table summarizes our impairment of real estate included in continuing operations: 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our Board of Directors authorized a process to review strategic alternatives for our retail portfolio. We have begun discussions with certain strategic partners and other potential buyers for several of our retail assets. In connection with this review and discussions to date, we have updated our impairment analysis on our retail assets, including increasing the likelihood of near-term sales. As a result, the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeded the carrying value of the   Shops at Northfield Stapleton   and   Boulevard Mall,   requiring us to adjust the carrying value to their estimated fair value during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . We have not entered into any agreements, and can not ensure a transaction can or will be consummated and therefore, such assets continue to be classified as held in use.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we decided to pursue the partial sale, through a joint venture, of   Westchester's Ridge Hill  . At September 30, 2015, discussions with a potential joint venture partner were ongoing and remained subject to further negotiation and applicable due diligence periods. The advanced status of the discussions triggered management to update the undiscounted cash flow analysis including the probability weighted estimated holding period. As a result, the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flows no longer exceeded the carrying value, requiring us to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2015. We closed on the disposition of   51%   of our equity interest in January 2016. See Note   S       Net Gain on Disposition of Full or Partial Interest in Rental Properties, Net of Tax   in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10 Q for detailed information on the transaction. 
  Impairment of Unconsolidated Entities 
  The following table summarizes our impairment of unconsolidated entities: 

Pacific Park Brooklyn   is a   22   acre mixed-use project in Brooklyn, New York. On June 30, 2014, we entered into a joint venture with Greenland Atlantic Yards, LLC, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based Greenland Holding Group Company Limited ( Greenland ) to develop the project. Under the joint venture, Greenland acquired   70%   of the project and agreed to co-develop the project with us, along with sharing in the entire project costs going forward in proportion to ownership interests. The joint venture was formed to execute on the remaining development rights, including the infrastructure and vertical construction of the residential units, but excluded   Barclay s Center   and   461 Dean Street   apartment community. Consistent with the approved master plan, the joint venture agreed to develop the remaining portion of Phase I and all of Phase II of the project, including the permanent rail yard. At the time of closing, the remaining portion of Phase I included   seven   buildings, totaling approximately   3.1 million   square feet. Phase II consists of   seven   buildings totaling approximately   3.3 million   square feet and further obligations to complete significant additional infrastructure improvements including a platform over the permanent rail yard.

Upon closing of the partial sale on June 30, 2014, it was determined we were not the primary beneficiary of the joint venture and the entity was deconsolidated and subsequently accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The transaction resulted in net cash proceeds of   $208,275,000  . The basis of the investment at the time approximated fair value as supported by the sales price and underlying discounted cash flow model used by both parties to underwrite the transaction. Due to the nature of the project in terms of size, duration and complexity, the underlying discounted cash flow model included many estimates and assumptions of future events. Key estimates in the discounted cash flow model include horizontal infrastructure costs including, among other things, estimates of completing the permanent rail yard and the platform over the rail yard, rent growth in the rental buildings and sales prices for condo buildings, trade costs for vertical construction, timing of starting vertical construction and opening buildings, terminal cap rates and the underlying discount rate. 
  The joint venture broke ground on the first affordable apartment community,   535 Carlton  , in December, 2014. In mid-2015, the joint venture commenced construction on   two   more buildings,   38 Sixth Avenue  , an affordable apartment building, and   550 Vanderbilt,   a condominium building. From the formation of the joint venture in June 2014 through the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we reviewed the estimates and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model and updated them as necessary. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, it became evident the occupancy and rental rate declines in the Brooklyn market was determined not to be temporary as a result of an increased supply of new rental product amplified by the sun-setting and the uncertainty around the 421 A real estate tax abatement program. Over the last quarter, the condominium market in New York has also softened, causing the projected sale schedule for   550 Vanderbilt   to be adjusted accordingly. Separately, the construction costs across the New York market continue to trend upward, resulting in increases in the estimated trade costs for certain infrastructure as well as vertical construction. In addition, the expiration of and the continued uncertainty related to the availability of the 421 A real estate tax abatement program puts further stress on anticipated returns. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as part of our formal strategic plan update, a decision was made to revise the overall project schedule for   Pacific Park Brooklyn  . Accordingly, we updated the discounted cash flow model to reflect the updated timing of the project schedule as well as the revenue, expense and cost assumptions. Based on the above, the estimated fair value of the investment no longer exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of   $299,300,000   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining basis in the investment (net of estimated future funding obligations) is not material. 
  See Note   M       Impairment of Real Estate and Impairment of Unconsolidated Entities   in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10 Q for detailed information on other impairments. 
  Interest and Other Income 
  Interest and other income was   $11,980,000   and   $32,665,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $8,995,000   and   $27,977,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The net   increase   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   is primarily related to interest income on notes receivable related to the Nets and   Barclays Center   sales, partially offset by decreased income recognition on the allocation of state and federal historic preservation, low income housing and new market tax credits.

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in interest expense related to the change in consolidation method is due to the change from full consolidation to equity method accounting upon the formation of a joint venture with an outside partner in   Westchester s Ridge Hill   (Q1-2016). The decrease in corporate recourse debt interest expense is due to the separate, privately negotiated exchanges of a portion of our Senior Notes due 2016, 2018 and 2020 for either shares of Class A common stock, cash payments or a combination of both during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  
  The following table presents interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . All amounts are presented in thousands. 

The decrease in interest expense for the comparable portfolio is primarily due to the paydown of the nonrecourse mortgage note for   One MetroTech Center   (Q2-2015). The decrease in interest expense related to capitalized interest is due to the increased number of projects under construction and development as we increased our construction pipeline. The decrease in corporate recourse debt interest expense is due to the separate, privately negotiated exchanges of a portion of our Senior Notes due 2016, 2018 and 2020 for either shares of Class A common stock, cash payments or a combination of both during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  
  Amortization of Mortgage Procurement Costs 
  Amortization of mortgage procurement costs was   $1,314,000   and   $4,395,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1,793,000   and   $5,756,000   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease from the prior periods is primarily due to our ongoing deleveraging strategy.

     Non-Cash Transactions - $(510,537,000) 
             
    $(487,684,000) related to gains on change in control of interest from the June 2015 acquisition of our partner s 49% equity ownership interest in the MIT Assets, and the April 2015 acquisition of our partner s 50% ownership interest in three operating apartment communities   (Cherry Tree, Chestnut Lake   and   Stratford Crossing)  ; 
                 
    $7,614,000 related to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the disposition of our full interest in entities that develop and manage military family housing,   Avenue at Tower City Center   and   Barclays Center,   the disposition of our partial interest in   Westchester s Ridge Hill   in 2016 and the disposition of our full interest in   Skylight Office Tower   in     Q3 2015.

Income Taxes 
             
    $(80,140,000) due to increased income tax expense primarily due to gains on sale of assets owned by our TRS in 2016. The tax expense in 2016 is primarily non-cash as it largely relates to the utilization of the deferred tax asset to offset the taxable gain on the various sales. As we are operating as a REIT in 2016, the majority of our operations, other than those in our TRS, will not be subject to federal income tax. As a result, 2016 tax expense is not directly comparable to 2015 due to our change in taxpayer status.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Multifamily rental properties continue to perform well throughout the majority of the United States although increased supply is beginning to impact occupancy levels and rental growth in some gateway cities. Other types of commercial real estate are improving to varying degrees depending on product type and geographic market. Access to bank credit and capital remains open with banks and permanent lenders originating new loans for real estate projects. Originations of new loans for commercial mortgage backed securities have slowed recently due to increased market volatility. Lenders continue favoring high quality operating assets in strong markets. While banks continue to originate construction loans for multifamily projects, construction loans for office or retail projects remain difficult to obtain, unless the project has substantial pre-leasing in place or higher than historical equity commitments from the developer. 
  Source of Funds 
  Our principal sources of funds are cash provided by operations including land sales, our revolving credit facility, our committed term loan facility (undrawn as of   September 30, 2016  ), nonrecourse mortgage debt and notes payable, dispositions of operating properties or development projects through sales or equity joint ventures, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, common or preferred equity and other financing arrangements. We have consistently disposed of assets in an effort to recycle capital and reposition our portfolio. Over the last ten years, we have generated cash proceeds from dispositions of full or partial interests in rental properties, development projects and other investments averaging well in excess of $100,000,000 per year. Given the diversity of our portfolio by market and product type, we believe the market for property dispositions will continue to be available. The current market should allow us to continue our historical strategy to recycle capital and reposition the portfolio through asset sales or equity joint ventures. 
  Our strategic plan drives our capital strategy and business focus on core products located in core markets. In order to achieve our strategic goals, we believe we can maximize cash provided by operations by concentrating our portfolio in the markets we believe are best positioned for long term growth. Additionally, we evaluate each individual asset in our operating and development portfolio to identify those having the best opportunity to provide capital through full or partial sale in conjunction with our strategy of focusing on core products located in core markets. This process may result in reductions to estimated holding periods and the total estimated undiscounted cash flows used for impairment calculations on our individual consolidated real estate assets. In some cases, this may result in estimated undiscounted cash flows being less than the carrying value of the consolidated asset and necessitating an impairment charge to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. 
  In addition, our capital strategy includes evaluating potential equity joint ventures to provide capital through the sales of partial interests of operating properties or to reduce our equity requirements and development risk on development opportunities. Entering into joint ventures could result in us granting joint control or losing control of the asset and, accordingly, the asset would no longer be consolidated. Upon deconsolidation, our investment balance in the joint venture would be compared to estimated fair value and recorded at the lesser of fair value or book value. Additionally, evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis would be required. This could result in future impairments, some of which could be significant, that would not otherwise be required if the real estate asset remained consolidated. 
  Strategic Alternatives for our Retail Portfolio 
  In August 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a process to review strategic alternatives for our retail portfolio. We intend to look at a range of options and expect the review process to be concluded by the first quarter of 2017. Assuming we identify and are able to transact on a chosen alternative, or alternatives, our intent would be to dispose of our retail assets in a tax-deferred manner and redeploy the equity from our retail portfolio into apartment and office assets that align with our focus on core markets and urban, mixed-use placemaking projects, including amenity retail. If we are able to execute on the redeployment strategy, we would expect to generate larger than average proceeds from dispositions and more acquisition activity in the next 24-36 months than historical results. 
  As part of the retail strategy, we have begun discussions with certain strategic partners and other potential buyers for several of the retail assets. As a result, we updated our impairment analysis on our retail assets, which resulted in the recording of a significant impairment charge during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   related to two of our consolidated assets. As we continue to review strategic alternatives for our retail portfolio, we may be required to continue to update our undiscounted cash flow impairment analysis of our fully consolidated assets, including our probability weighted estimated holding periods. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may result in future impairments. However, if we are able to execute on our current plan at estimated pricing, we would expect to recognize a significant gain on our retail portfolio. There can be no assurance that any transaction could be consummated in a tax deferred manner, or at all.

     Table of Contents  

Use of Funds 
  Our principal uses of funds include the financing of our real estate operating and development projects, capital expenditures for our existing operating portfolio, principal and interest payments on our nonrecourse mortgage debt and notes payable, revolving credit facility, term loan facility (when drawn upon) and senior notes, payment of our earnings and profits distribution made in the first quarter of 2016, our quarterly payments of common stock dividends (commencing with our REIT election in 2016) and selective operating asset acquisitions, including joint venture partner acquisitions. As noted in the retail portfolio discussion, if we can execute on tax-deferred sales of our retail assets, we would expect to have an uptick in asset acquisitions compared to our historical activity.  
  Our capital strategy seeks to isolate the operating and financial risk at the property level to reduce risk on and of our equity capital. We typically do not cross-collateralize our mortgage debt and notes payable outside of a single identifiable project. As such, a majority of our operating and development properties are separately encumbered with nonrecourse mortgage debt or notes payable, which provides protection by allowing the lender to look only to the single asset securing the lender in the event of a default.  
  As discussed above, a majority of our assets are separately encumbered. Since 2011, our capital strategy has focused on reducing our overall leverage level. During 2015, we began establishing an unencumbered asset pool. We believe this change in financing strategy is consistent with our deleveraging efforts and provides us greater financial flexibility. While our unencumbered asset pool is modest at   September 30, 2016  , we intend to add unencumbered assets to this pool during 2016 and beyond, as we continue to make progress toward our deleveraging goals. 
  Prior to our conversion to a REIT in 2016, we operated as a C corporation and retained substantially all of our internally generated cash. This cash, together with refinancing and property sale proceeds, has historically provided us with the necessary liquidity to take advantage of investment opportunities. The economic downturn and its impact on the lending and capital markets reduced our ability to finance development and acquisition opportunities and modified the required rates of return to make new investment opportunities appealing. As a result of these market changes, we have established self-imposed limitations on entering into new development activities. 
  We continue to make progress on certain other pre-development projects, primarily multifamily projects located in core markets. The cash required to fund our equity in projects under construction and development plus cash necessary to extend or pay down our near-term debt maturities is anticipated to exceed our cash from operations. As a result, we intend to extend maturing debt or repay it with net proceeds from property sales, equity joint ventures, borrowings on our revolving credit facility, our undrawn term loan facility or future debt or equity financing. 
  The Nets and Barclays Center - Disposal 
  In January 2016, we sold our equity interest in the Nets and   Barclays Center  . Proceeds from the sale were received in a combination of cash and notes receivable. The sales price for our equity interest in   Barclays Center   was $162,600,000, generating net cash proceeds of   $60,924,000   and a note receivable of $92,600,000, which bears interest at 4.50% per annum payable semi-annually and matures in 2019. In addition, the buyer assumed the gross debt that amounted to   $457,745,000  .  
  The sales price for our equity interest in the Nets was $125,100,000 payable entirely in the form of a note receivable, which bears interest at 4.50% per annum payable at maturity and matures in 2021.  
  461 Dean Street  
  461 Dean Street   is an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York adjacent to the   Barclays Center   at the   Pacific Park Brooklyn   project. This modular construction project opened during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . We had a fixed price contract (the  CM Contract ) with Skanska USA to construct the apartment building. In 2014, Skanska USA ceased construction and we terminated the CM Contract for cause. Each party has filed lawsuits relating primarily to the project s delays and associated additional completion costs. We continue to vigorously pursue legal action against Skanska USA for damages related to their default of the CM Contract. However, there is no assurance we will be successful in recovering these damages. 
  Nonrecourse Mortgage Financings 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $90,894,000   of nonrecourse mortgage financings with scheduled maturities during the year ending   December 31, 2016  , of which $9,440,000, represents regularly scheduled amortization payments. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we have addressed $80,759,000 of these maturities through closed transactions and loan commitments. Although the majority of the the 2016 nonrecourse mortgage maturities have been addressed, if we are unable to negotiate an extension or otherwise refinance the remaining maturities, we could go into default and the lender could commence foreclosure proceedings on the single collateralized asset, which would likely result in a loss of the asset or an impairment which could be significant. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had one nonrecourse mortgage greater than five percent of our total nonrecourse mortgage debt and notes payable, net. The mortgage encumbers the   New York Times   office building, has an outstanding balance of $640,000,000 and matures in September 2017. We intend to use proceeds from the Term Loan Facility, along with additional cash, to address the maturity of this nonrecourse mortgage debt prior to year end.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of nonrecourse mortgage debt and notes payable, net recorded on our unconsolidated subsidiaries amounted to   $2,410,756,000  , of which   $168,500,000   ($4,933,000 represents scheduled principal payments) is scheduled to mature during the year ending   December 31, 2016  . Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we have addressed $155,131,000 of these maturities through closed transactions and loan commitments. Negotiations are ongoing to address the remaining 2016 maturities, but we cannot give assurance we will obtain these financings on favorable terms or at all.  
  2016 Liquidity Transactions 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we completed the following transactions, which increased liquidity, reduced debt resulting in lower future fixed charges for interest, reduced future development equity requirements and development risk and strengthened our balance sheet. 
             
    We entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement which provides for a   $335,000,000   senior unsecured term loan credit facility ( Term Loan Facility ). As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not drawn on the Term Loan Facility. However, we expect to draw on the Term Loan Facility, and with additional cash, address the $640,000,000 nonrecourse mortgage debt of the   New York Times   office building due in 2017 prior to year end.  
                  
    We completed the sale of our interests in entities that develop and manage military family housing. The sale generated net cash proceeds of   $208,305,000  . 
                 
    We entered into a joint venture agreement with outside partners, affiliated entities of QIC, one of the largest institutional investment managers in Australia. The outside partner invested in and received 51% of our equity interest in   Westchester s Ridge Hill,   a formerly wholly owned regional mall in Yonkers, New York. We received net cash proceeds of   $75,448,000   along with the buyer assuming debt of   $169,369,000  , representing   51%   of the nonrecourse mortgage debt of the property. 
                
    We formed and entered into a new joint venture with outside partners, affiliated entities of QIC. We contributed our equity interest in   Ballston Quarter  , a formerly wholly owned regional mall in Arlington, Virginia, and certain residential development rights to the new joint venture. The outside partner invested   $36,269,000   of cash directly into the new joint venture and assumed debt of   $20,825,000  , representing   49%   of the nonrecourse mortgage debt of the property. 
                
    We completed the sale of   Avenue at Tower City Center,   a specialty retail center in Cleveland, Ohio     and related parking facility assets,   Terminal Tower   and   Aperture Center,   office buildings in Cleveland, Ohio and Albuquerque, New Mexico, respectively, and five floors of the   Johns Hopkins Parking Garage   located in Baltimore, Maryland. The sales generated net cash proceeds of $106,800,000. These dispositions are part of our strategy to sell operating assets in non-core markets and non-core operating assets. 
                
    We completed the sale of   Steinway Street Theaters  , an unconsolidated specialty retail center in Queens, New York. The sale generated net cash proceeds of   $14,059,000  . 
                  
    We contributed   West Village II  , an apartment community under construction in Dallas, Texas, into our residential strategic capital partnership with Arizona State Retirement System. 
     Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we completed the following transactions. 
             
    We entered into a new joint venture agreement with outside partners, affiliated entities of QIC. The outside partner invested in and received   49%   of our equity interests in   Shops at Wiregrass  , a formerly wholly owned regional mall in Tampa, Florida and a development opportunity adjacent to the   Shops at Wiregrass  . We received net cash proceeds of approximately   $25,300,000   along with the buyer assuming debt of   $40,497,000  , representing   49%   of the nonrecourse mortgage debt of the property.

Completed the sale of   Grand Lowry Lofts  , an apartment community in Denver, Colorado. The sale generated net cash proceeds of approximately   $22,900,000  .  
     We continue to explore various options to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity, but can give no assurance we can accomplish any of these other options on terms favorable to us or at all. If we cannot enhance our liquidity, it could adversely impact our growth and result in further curtailment of development activities. 
  2016 Dividends 
  We plan to elect to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, upon filing the 2016 Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service on or before September 15, 2017. We have been operating, and plan to continue operating, in a manner consistent with REIT qualification rules since January 1, 2016. As a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we must annually distribute to our shareholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gain and net of any available net operating losses). We intend to distribute 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. Our REIT taxable income typically will not include income earned by our TRSs except to the extent the TRSs pay dividends to us. 
  Prior to the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, our predecessor, Forest City Enterprises, Inc., operated as a C corporation. A REIT is not permitted to retain earnings and profits ( E P ) accumulated during the periods when the company or its predecessor was taxed as a C corporation or accumulated by the company s or its predecessor s TRS not converted to a qualified REIT subsidiary. We were required to make one or more distributions to our shareholders that equals or exceeds our accumulated positive E P. 
  The following table summarizes cash dividends declared by the Board of Directors on our Class A and Class B common stock (in thousands, except per share data): 

The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
  Financial Covenants 
  Our revolving credit facility and term loan facility contain certain restrictive financial covenants. A summary of the key financial covenants as defined in the agreement, all of which we are compliant with at   September 30, 2016  , follows:

  See Note   F       Convertible Senior Debt, Net   in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for detailed information. 
  Nonrecourse Debt Financings 
  We use taxable and tax-exempt nonrecourse debt for our real estate projects. Although it is our intent to increase the size of our unencumbered asset pool, the majority of our operating and development properties are separately encumbered with nonrecourse mortgage debt, which in some limited circumstances is supplemented by nonrecourse notes payable (collectively  nonrecourse debt ). For real estate projects financed with tax-exempt debt, we generally utilize variable-rate debt. For construction loans, we generally pursue variable-rate financings with maturities ranging from two to five years. For those real estate projects financed with taxable debt, we generally seek long-term, fixed-rate financing for those operating projects whose loans mature or are projected to open and achieve stabilized operations. 
  We are actively working to refinance and/or extend the maturities of the nonrecourse debt coming due in the next 24 months. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we completed the following financings: 

Cash Flows 
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   was   $190,034,000   and   $158,550,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. The net increase in cash provided by operating activities of   $31,484,000   is primarily the result of changes in operating assets and liabilities between the comparable periods along with reduced interest payments.

Investing Activities 
  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities   was   $13,847,000   and   $(756,673,000)   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and consisted of the following:

The net increase in cash used in financing activities of   $713,442,000   is primarily the result of cash paid for the redemption of a portion of our 2018 and 2020 Senior Notes, dividends paid to shareholders and the acquisitions of noncontrolling interests subsequent to the sale of   Barclays Center   and the Nets. The use of cash to pay down debt is consistent with our ongoing deleveraging strategy. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business, and management and legal counsel believe these claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Our market risk includes the inability to obtain construction loans, refinance existing construction loans into long-term fixed-rate nonrecourse financing, refinance existing nonrecourse financing at maturity, obtain renewals or replacement of credit enhancement devices, such as letters of credit, or otherwise obtain funds by selling real estate assets or by raising equity. We also have interest-rate exposure on our current variable-rate debt portfolio. During the construction period, we have historically used variable-rate debt to finance developmental projects. At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding variable-rate debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility, consisted of   $1,170,365,000   of taxable debt and   $605,630,000   of tax-exempt debt. Upon opening and achieving stabilized operations, we have historically procured long-term fixed-rate financing for our rental properties. If we are unable to procure long-term fixed-rate financing, we would pursue extending maturities with existing lenders. Additionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk upon maturity of our long-term fixed-rate financings. The total weighted average interest rate includes the impact of interest rate swaps, caps and long-term contracts in place as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

Interest Rate Exposure 
  The following table summarizes the composition of nonrecourse debt, net: 

To mitigate short-term variable interest rate risk, we have purchased interest rate hedges for our variable-rate debt as follows: 
  Taxable   (Priced off of LIBOR Index) 

Tax-Exempt   (Priced off of Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) Index) 

The tax-exempt caps generally were purchased in conjunction with lender hedging requirements that require the borrower to protect against significant fluctuations in interest rates. Except for those requirements, we generally do not hedge tax-exempt debt due to its historically low interest rates. 
  Sensitivity Analysis to Changes in Interest Rates 
  Including the effect of the protection provided by the interest rate swaps, caps and long-term contracts in place as of   September 30, 2016  , a 100 basis point increase in taxable interest rates (including properties accounted for under the equity method, corporate debt and the effect of interest rate floors) would increase the annual pre-tax interest cost for the next 12 months of our variable-rate debt by approximately $4,649,000 at   September 30, 2016  . Although tax-exempt rates generally move in an amount smaller than corresponding changes in taxable interest rates, a 100 basis point increase in tax-exempt rates (including properties accounted for under the equity method) would increase the annual pre-tax interest cost for the next 12 months of our tax-exempt variable-rate debt by approximately $6,326,000 at   September 30, 2016  . This analysis includes a portion of our taxable and tax-exempt variable-rate debt related to construction loans for which the interest expense is capitalized. 
  We enter into total rate of return swaps ( TROR ) on various tax-exempt fixed-rate borrowings. The TROR convert borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate. The TROR requires the payment of a variable interest rate, generally equivalent to the SIFMA rate (  0.84%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus a spread. Additionally, we have guaranteed the fair value of the underlying borrowings. Fluctuation in the value of the TROR is offset by the fluctuation in the value of the underlying borrowings, resulting in minimal financial impact. At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional amount of TROR designated as fair value hedging instruments is   $551,985,000  . The underlying TROR borrowings are subject to a fair value adjustment. In addition, we have TROR with notional amounts aggregating   $138,564,000   that are not designated as fair value hedging instruments, but are subject to interest rate risk. 
  
   67 

     Table of Contents  

We estimate the fair value of our hedging instruments based on interest rate market and bond pricing models. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded interest rate caps, swaps and TROR with positive fair values of approximately   $13,750,000   and   $13,311,000  , respectively, in other assets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded interest rate swaps and TROR that had a negative fair value of approximately   $60,595,000   and   $73,679,000  , respectively, in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. 
  We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt instruments by market rates, if available, or by discounting future cash payments at interest rates that approximate the current market. Estimated fair value is based upon market prices of public debt, available industry financing data, current treasury rates and recent financing transactions. Based on these parameters, the table below contains the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, net (exclusive of the fair value of derivatives) at   September 30, 2016  . 

The following table provides information about our long-term debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or furnishes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Securities Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, which includes the CEO and CFO. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  In connection with the rules, the Company continues to review and document its disclosure controls and procedures, including the Company s internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and ensuring that the Company s systems evolve with the business.
