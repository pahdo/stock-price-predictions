1.      ASSET SALE   

On April 5, 2013, Special Diversified Opportunities
Inc. (f/k/a Strategic Diagnostics Inc.) ( SDOI  or the  Company ), SDIX LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the  Purchaser ) and OriGene Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the sole equity holder of the
Purchaser, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company
agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions including approval of the Company's stockholders, to sell to the Purchaser substantially
all of the Company s rights, title and interest in substantially all of the Company s non-cash assets related to the
Life Sciences Business (the  Asset Sale ). 

At a special meeting of the stockholders
of the Company held on July 10, 2013, the stockholders approved the Asset Sale as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.
On July 12, 2013 the Company completed the Asset Sale. 

2.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Business  

The Company is a shell company as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's board of directors has been exploring strategic alternatives
to maximize shareholder value going forward including deploying the proceeds of the Asset Sale in business acquisition opportunities,
merging with another company, or other actions to redeploy our capital, including, without limitation, distribution of cash to
our shareholders. 

Basis of Presentation and Interim Financial Statements   

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements include all adjustments (all of
which are of a normal recurring nature) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations. The interim operating results
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the consolidated interim
financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated interim financial
statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the period. These estimates include those made in connection with assessing
the valuation of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments that have maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:

STATEMENTS   
 (in thousands, except share and per share data)  
 (unaudited)  

2.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)  

Marketable Securities, Available for Sale  

Marketable securities consist of securities
with original maturities greater than three months, and are comprised of U.S. Treasury Bills and securities issued by U.S. government
agencies. Marketable securities have been classified as current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September
30, 2016 based upon the nature of the securities and their intended use to fund operations. 

Management determines the appropriate classification
of securities at the time of purchase. The Company has classified its investment portfolio as available for sale in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 320,  Investments-Debt
and Equity Securities.  The Company's available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method
and are included in interest income (expense). 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
using the fair value method, which requires that compensation costs related to employee share based payment transactions are measured
in the financial statements at the fair value on the date of grant and are recognized over the vesting period of the award. 

3 .   Fair Value Measurements  

The Company measures certain assets at fair
value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 , Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The guidance in ASC 820 outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to
increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is
broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows: 

Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.   

Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 and quoted prices in active markets for similar assets.   

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable.

STATEMENTS   
 (in thousands, except share and per share data)  
 (unaudited)  

3.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)  

The Company has used Level 1 inputs
to determine the fair value of its cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale. As of September 30, 2016,
cost represented fair value of the Company's cash equivalents and marketable securities. 

4.    BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE  

Basic loss per share (EPS) is computed by
dividing net loss available for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS, except that the dilutive effect of converting or exercising all potentially dilutive securities
is also included in the denominator such as stock options and restricted stock units. Basic loss per share excludes potentially
dilutive securities. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, outstanding common stock options representing
674,570 and 1,034,570 shares, respectively, and 342,500 and 15,000 unvested restricted shares, respectively, were excluded from
the computation of diluted EPS. 

5.    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  

Under various plans, executives, key employees
and outside directors receive awards of options to purchase common stock. The Company has a stock option plan (the  2000
Plan ) which authorizes the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units. Incentive stock
options are granted at not less than 100% of fair market value at the date of grant (110% for stockholders owning more than 10%
of the Company s common stock). Nonqualified stock options are granted at not less than 85% of fair market value at the date
of grant. A maximum of 8,000,000 shares of common stock are issuable under the 2000 Plan. Certain additional options have been
granted outside the 2000 Plan. These options generally follow the provisions of the 2000 Plan. The Company issues new shares to
satisfy option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock awards. 

The Company also has an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ). The ESPP allows eligible full-time employees to purchase shares of common stock at 90 percent
of the lower of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the first or last day of the quarter. Eligible employees are
provided the opportunity to acquire Company common stock during each quarter. No more than 661,157 shares of common stock may be
issued under the ESPP. Such stock may be unissued shares or treasury shares of the Company or may be outstanding shares purchased
in the open market or otherwise on behalf of the ESPP. The Company s ESPP is compensatory and therefore, the Company is required
to recognize compensation expense related to the discount from market value of shares sold under the ESPP. The Company issues new
shares to satisfy shares purchased under the ESPP.

Share-based compensation expense recorded
in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows: 

Share-based compensation expense is a component
of selling, general and administrative expense, and is recorded as a non-cash expense in the operating activities section of the
Company s consolidated statements of cash flows. 

No options were exercised in the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Information with respect to the activity of outstanding stock options granted under
the 2000 Plan and options granted separately from the 2000 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is summarized as follows:

5.    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)  

The following table provides additional
information about the Company s stock options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016: 

The Company grants restricted stock awards ( RSA ),
which is the right to receive shares of common stock. In May 2016, the Company issued to non-employee directors RSA's aggregating
340,000 shares with performance based vesting. These shares vest upon the achievement of certain corporate goals within 18 months
of the grant date. No expense has been recognized for these awards at September 30, 2016; the expense will be recognized when the
corporate goals are achieved.  

The Company had 342,500 and 7,500 shares
of unvested restricted stock as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

6.     INCOME
TAXES   

The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets
on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required. The Company had a full
valuation allowance offsetting its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets which primarily represent net operating loss
carryforwards ( NOLs ) at December 31, 2015. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company s
management concluded that the full valuation allowance for U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets is appropriate as the
facts and circumstances during the first nine months of 2016 did not change management s conclusion that a full valuation
allowance is necessary. 

The Company is subject to U.S. federal
income tax, as well as income taxes of multiple state jurisdictions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain
tax positions in income tax expense. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no interest or penalties accrued related to uncertain
tax positions due to the available NOLs. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
approximately $628 of unrecognized tax benefits, $622 of which were recorded as a reduction to existing net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards, and therefore require no accrual for interest or penalty. The remaining $6 includes de minimis interest
and penalties where required. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits did not change. For federal
purposes, post-1992 tax years remain open to examination as a result of earlier net operating losses being utilized in subsequent
years. For state purposes, the statute of limitations remains open in a similar manner for states that have generated net operating
losses. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken in prior periods
will change significantly during the next 12 months.

7.    DISGORGEMENT OF SHORT SWING PROFIT  

On February 29, 2016, the Company was informed
by B. Riley   Co., LLC ( B. Riley ) that it had sold 3,504,172 shares of the Company's common stock in a transaction
that is matchable against B. Riley's purchase of 742,344 shares of the Company's common stock in December 2015. In accordance with
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which provides that any profit realized by an insider on short-swing transactions
must be disgorged to the Company, B. Riley paid the Company $133 for the disgorgement of profits in connection with these matchable
transactions. This amount was credited to additional paid-in capital during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 

8.    RIGHTS PLAN  

On April 27, 2016 (the  Rights Dividend
Declaration Date ), the Company's Board of Directors (the  Board of Directors ) adopted a Section 382 rights
plan (the  Section 382 Rights Plan ) and declared a dividend distribution of one Right (as defined below) for
each outstanding share of common stock of the Company to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2016. 

The Section 382 Rights Plan is intended
to act as a deterrent to any person (an  Acquiring Person ) acquiring (together with all affiliates and associates
of such person) beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company s outstanding Common Stock within the meaning of Section
382 of the Code, without the approval of the Board of Directors. Stockholders who beneficially own 4.99% or more of the Company s
outstanding Common Stock as of the Rights Dividend Declaration Date will not be deemed to be an Acquiring Person, but such person
will be deemed an Acquiring Person if such person (together with all affiliates and associates of such person) becomes the beneficial
owner of securities representing a percentage of the Common Stock that exceeds by 1.0% or more the lowest percentage of beneficial
ownership of the Common Stock that such person had at any time since the Rights Dividend Declaration Date. 

The Rights .  On the Rights
Dividend Declaration Date, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of one right (a  Right ) for each outstanding
share of the Common Stock to the Company s stockholders of record as of May 16, 2016. Subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Section 382 Rights Agreement, if the Rights become exercisable, each Right would initially represent the right
to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company s Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, for a purchase price of $5.00 per Right (the  Purchase Price ). If issued, each fractional
share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation
rights as does one share of the Common Stock. However, prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder
of the Company, including any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.

Forward-Looking Statements   

This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking
statements reflecting the current expectations of Special Diversified Opportunities Inc. and its subsidiary (the  Company 
or  SDOI ). In addition, when used in this quarterly report, the words  anticipate,   enable, 
 estimate,   intend,   expect,   believe,   potential,   may, 
 will,   should,   project  and similar expressions as they relate to the Company are intended
to identify said forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties,
which may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated at this time. Such risks and uncertainties include factors more
fully described in the Company s public filings with the SEC including, without limitation, the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Introductory Note  

On April 5, 2013, Special Diversified Opportunities
Inc. (f/k/a Strategic Diagnostics Inc.) ( SDOI  or the  Company ), SDIX LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the  Purchaser ) and OriGene Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the sole equity holder of the
Purchaser, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company
agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions including approval of the Company's stockholders, to sell to Purchaser substantially
all of the Company s rights, title and interest in substantially all of the Company s non-cash assets related to the
Life Sciences Business (the  Asset Sale ). 

At a special meeting of the stockholders
of the Company held on July 10, 2013, the stockholders approved the Asset Sale as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.
On July 12, 2013 the Company completed the Asset Sale. 

Overview  

The Company is presently a shell company
and the Company's board of directors has been exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value going forward, including
deploying the proceeds of the Asset Sale in business acquisition opportunities, merging with another company, or other actions
to redeploy our capital, including, without limitation, distribution of cash to our shareholders. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Selling, general and administrative  

Selling, general and administrative expenses
include personnel costs, professional fees and other expenses related to the Company's current level of activity while the Company
explores its future direction and opportunities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $268,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 to $274,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable
to increased legal expenses and management and board costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions. This increase
was offset by lower personnel costs in the 2016 period as well as the absence of costs associated with the 2015 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders as the 2016 annual meeting has not occurred yet.  

Income taxes  

The Company recorded no income tax provision
for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The Company has a full valuation allowance offsetting
its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. 

Table of Contents   

Net loss  

Net loss was $266,000, or $0.01 per diluted
share, for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $268,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for
the same period in 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Selling, general and administrative  

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased from $810,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to $610,000 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs as well as the absence of costs associated with the
2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders as the 2016 annual meeting has not occurred yet. This decrease was partially offset by an increase
in professional fees and management and board costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions. 

Income taxes  

The Company recorded no income tax provision
for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The Company has a full valuation allowance offsetting
its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. 

Net loss  

Net loss was $601,000, or $0.03 per diluted
share, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $810,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for
the same period in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The net cash used in operating activities
was $507,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $910,000 for the first nine
months of 2015. The net cash used in operating activities for the 2016 period was primarily the result of the net loss incurred
partially offset by a increase in accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid expenses. The net cash used in operating activities
for the 2015 period was primarily the result of the net loss incurred, combined with an increase in other current assets and a
decrease in accrued expenses. 

The Company used $9,981,000 to purchase
marketable securities, available for sale in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. There was no cash used in investing activities
in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
of $133,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 represents cash received from B. Riley for the disgorgement of profits
on matchable transactions as discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. There was no cash
provided by financing activities in the nine months ended June 30, 2015. 

The Company s working capital (current
assets less current liabilities) was $22.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $23.2 million at December 31, 2015.  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company satisfied all of its cash requirements from cash available and on-hand. Based upon its cash and cash equivalents
on hand, the Company believes it has sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements through at least the next 12 months.
The Company has invested a portion of its cash balance in short term investment instruments as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company's ability to meet its long-term
capital needs will depend on a number of factors, including government regulation, its successful sale of additional common stock
and/or the Company successfully locating and obtaining other financing, and the success of the Company's plan to make future acquisitions
or enter into a merger transaction. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to meet the future liquidity
requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our management, with the participation

controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

(b)  Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
