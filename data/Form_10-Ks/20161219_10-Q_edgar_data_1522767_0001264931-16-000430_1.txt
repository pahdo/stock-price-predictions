 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 

 (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

 Description of Business 

 We currently operate in two separate
segments with one segment being a 3D entertainment portal which leverages its proprietary licensed technology to offer visitors
a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call  worlds  and the second segment being a management company
in the medical cannabis industry. 

 We were formed on January 25,
2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Worlds Inc. (formerly known as Worlds.com Inc.). Effective May 16, 
 2011 Worlds   Inc.   transferred 
 to   us   the 
 majority   of   its 
 operations   and   related 
 operational   assets,   except 
 for   its   patent 
 portfolio. Worlds Inc. has also given us a perpetual world-wide license to its patented technology. Pursuant to the license
we have the right to issue   unlimited sublicenses to 
 the   licensed   technology, 
 subject   to   Worlds 
 Inc. s   reasonable consent. 

 The assets transferred to us include:
Worlds Inc. s technology platform, Worlds Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related
revenue, the following URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D
objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures. 

 The transfer   of   assets   occurred   in   the   context   of   the   spin-off   by   Worlds   Inc.   of   its   online   and   operational   technologies   businesses   to   us.
The spin-off was effectuated by Worlds Inc. declaring a dividend of its shares of its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Worlds
Online, Inc. with each share of Worlds Inc. to receive 1/3 of a share of Worlds Online with all fractional   shares   rounded   up.   Worlds   Inc.   did   not   want   a   trading   market   to   develop   for   its   shares   until   the   SEC   completed   its   review   of
its registration statement on Form 10. Accordingly, the actual distribution of the dividend did not occur until the
payment date of March 12, 2012. Our stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Approximately 23,859,248 shares were issued as
part of the dividend distribution and immediately following the distribution Worlds Inc. continued to own approximately 19.6%
of our outstanding shares. Worlds Inc. intends to dispose of its stock in an orderly fashion into the open market or in
private sales, in either case   in   ways   designed   not   to   impact   the   market,   but   in   any   event   within   five   years   of   the   dividend   payment   debt
to the extent reasonable practical.   While   it
holds   any   of our   shares   it   will   vote   them   in   proportion   to   the   votes   by   other   stockholders. 

 On May 19, 2014, We entered
into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) between MariMed Advisors Inc.
( MariMed ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Sigal Consulting LLC ( Sigal ),
a Massachusetts limited liability company, and the Members of Sigal ( Sellers ). The transaction closed on
September 29, 2014. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company, through MariMed, acquired all of the assets of Sigal and the
Sellers received the aggregate amount of (i) the Company s common stock (WORX) equal to 50% of the Company s
outstanding common stock on the Closing Date; (ii) three million options to purchase shares of the Company s common
stock which are exercisable over five years with various exercise prices ranging from $0.15 to $0.35 and (iii) 49% of
MariMed s outstanding common stock. As a result, the Company s ownership of MariMed was reduced from 100% to
51%. 

 The transaction was accounted
for as a purchase acquisition/merger wherein the Company is both accounting acquirer and legal acquirer. Accordingly, the company
recorded the assets purchased and liabilities assumed as part of the merger and the portion that the fair value 
 of   the   common 
 stock   issued   and 
 options   granted   for 
 acquisition   over   the 
 book   value   of 
 Sigal   was   recorded 
 as   goodwill, which was subsequently impaired in 
 full. 

Table of Contents           

Basis of Presentation 

 The accompanying financial 
 statements   have been   prepared 
 in   conformity   with 
 accounting   principles   generally
accepted   in the   United States of America
( US GAAP ), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company will require substantial
additional funds for development and marketing of its products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain
the substantial additional capital resources necessary to pursue its business plan or that any assumptions relating to its business
plan will prove to be accurate. We were not able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain sufficient financing which 
 had   a   material 
 adverse   effect   on 
our ability to grow our business . These factors raise   substantial 
 doubt about   the   Company's 
 ability   to   continue 
 as   a   going 
 concern.   

 Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

 Trading Securities 

 Trading securities
are common stock in publicly traded companies. We currently have securities from two entities, one that was received as
compensation for performing consulting services and the other was purchased as an investment. The carrying value of the
investments is the market price of the shares at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Any unrealized gain or loss are
recorded under other income/(expense) in the accompanying statements of operations. 

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 Cash and cash equivalents are comprised
of highly liquid money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. 

 Revenue Recognition 

 The Company has the following source
of revenue: VIP subscriptions to our Worlds Ultimate 3-D Chat service and consulting and other revenues from MariMed. The Company
recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: evidence of an arrangement exists such as a signed contract, delivery
has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonable assured. This will usually be in the form of
a receipt of a customer s acceptance indicating the product has been completed to their satisfaction except for development
work and service revenue which is recognized when the services have been performed. Deferred revenue represents cash payments received
in advance to be recorded as revenue when earned. The corresponding cost associated with those contracts is also deferred as deferred
costs until the revenue is ultimately recognized. 

 Research and Development Costs  

 Research and development costs
will be charged to operations as incurred.  

Table of Contents           

Intangible Asset - Websites  

 The Company
purchased several medical marijuana related websites in 2014. The cost of these websites were being amortized using the
straight line method over a period of five years. It was determined that the websites were not generating a deal flow for us
and was not generating any expected future economic benefit so the balance was written off at the end of 2015. 

 Property and Equipment 

 Property and equipment will be
stated at cost.   Depreciation will be provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets ranging from three to five years.  When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income.  Maintenance and repairs will
be charged to expense in the period incurred. 

 Impairment of Long Lived Assets  

 The Company evaluates the recoverability
of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Disclosure requires recognition of impairment of long-lived
assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is considered to be impaired and
is written down to fair value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values.  

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 The Company follows paragraph
825-10-50-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB
ASC ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes
a framework for measuring fair value in US GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  

Level 1  
      Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   
 
      Level 2  
      Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.   
 
      Level 3  
      Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

The carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity
of these instruments.  

Table of Contents           

Accounts Payable Related Party 

 Accounts payable related party
is comprised of cash payments made by Worlds Inc. on our behalf for shared operating expenses. 

 Deferred Revenue 

 Deferred revenue represents advance
payments for the license, the design and development of the software, content and related technology for the creation of an interactive,
3D entertainment portal on the internet. 

 Extinguishment of liabilities 

 The Company 
 accounts   for   extinguishment 
 of   liabilities in   accordance 
 with   the   guidance 
 set   forth   in 
 section   405-20   of 
 the   FASB   ASC 405-20. 
  Extinguishments of   Liabilities  When 
 the   conditions   are 
 met   for   the 
 extinguishment   accounting, the   liabilities 
 are derecognized and   the   gain 
 or   loss   on 
 the   extinguishment   is 
 recognized. 

 Stock-Based Compensation 

 The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosure about
Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). 
 That   cost   will 
 be   recognized   over 
 the   period   during 
 which   an   employee 
 is   required   to 
 provide   service   in 
 exchange for   the   award- 
 the   requisite   service 
 period   (usually   the 
 vesting   period).   No 
 compensation   cost   is 
 recognized   for   equity 
 instruments   for which   employees
do   not   render 
 the   requisite   service. 

 Income Taxes 

 The Company accounts for income
taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB ASC ( ASC 740 ). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are 
 reduced   by   a 
 valuation   allowance   to 
 the   extent   management 
 concludes   it   is 
 more   likely   than 
 not   that   the 
 assets   will   not 
 be   realized. Deferred   tax 
 assets   and   liabilities 
 are   measured   using 
 enacted   tax   rates 
 expected   to   apply 
 to   taxable   income 
 in   the   years 
 in   which   those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is 
 recognized   in the   consolidated
statements   of   operations 
 in   the   period 
 that   includes   the 
 enactment   date. 

 ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive
model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements
when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax 
 positions   must   initially 
 and   subsequently   be 
 measured   as   the 
 largest   amount   of 
 tax   benefit   that 
 has   a   greater 
 than 50%   likelihood   of 
 being   realized   upon 
 ultimate   settlement   with 
 the   tax   authority 
 assuming   full   knowledge 
 of   the   position 
 and   relevant facts.

Related Party Transactions 

 The Company follows subtopic 850-10
of the FASB ASC for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. 

 Pursuant to Section 850-10-20
the Related parties include a. affiliates of the Company; b. Entities for which investments in their equity securities would be
required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825 10 15,
to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing
trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company;
f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating
policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests; and g. Other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties
or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that
one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

 The financial statements shall
include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, 
 and   other   similar 
 items   in   the 
 ordinary   course   of 
 business.   However,   disclosure 
 of   transactions   that 
 are   eliminated in the preparation of financial statements is not required in
those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions,
including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements
are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial
statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects
of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related
parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise   apparent, 
 the   terms   and 
 manner   of   settlement. 

 Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

 The Company reports comprehensive
income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB ASC which establishes standards for the reporting
and display of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements. 
 There   were   no 
 items   of   comprehensive 
 income   (loss)   applicable 
 to   the   Company 
 during   the   period 
 covered   in   the 
 financial statements. 

 Loss Per Share 

 Net loss per common share
is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB ASC. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net   loss   by   the   weighted   average   number   of   shares   of   common   stock   outstanding   during   the   period.   Diluted   net   loss   per   share
is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares
of common stock during each period. As of June 30, 2015, there were 9,250,000 options whose effect is anti-dilutive and not
included   in   diluted   net   loss   per   share   at   June
30   ,   2015.   The   options   may   dilute   future   earnings   per   share.  

Table of Contents           

Commitments and Contingencies 

 The Company follows subtopic 450-20
of the FASB ASC to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are
issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail
to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result
in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 

 If the 
 assessment   of   a 
 contingency   indicates   that 
 it   is   probable 
 that   a   material 
 loss   has   been 
 incurred   and   the 
 amount   of   the 
 liability   can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in
the Company s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially   material 
 loss   contingency   is 
 not   probable   but 
 is   reasonably   possible, 
 or   is   probable 
 but   cannot   be 
 estimated,   then   the 
 nature of   the   contingent 
 liability,   and   an 
 estimate   of   the 
 range   of   possible 
 losses,   if   determinable 
 and   material,   would 
 be   disclosed. 

 Loss contingencies considered
remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees 
 would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have
a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no
assurance that such matters   will not   materially
and   adversely   affect 
 the   Company s   business, 
 financial position,   and   results
of   operations   or 
 cash   flows. 

 Risk and Uncertainties 

 The Company is subject to risks
common to companies in the technology industries, including, but not limited to, litigation, development of new technological innovations
and dependence on key personnel. The Company is also subject to risks arising from its medical marijuana related business inasmuch
as marijuana is still a federally prohibited substance. 

 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 The Company does not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements. 

 Uncertain Tax Positions 

 The Company did not take any
uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to unrecognized income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of
Section 740-10-25 for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Acquisition 

 On September 29, 2014 our wholly-owned
subsidiary, MariMed Advisors Inc. ( MariMed ), acquired all of the outstanding assets of Sigal Consulting LLC ( Sigal )
from its members, The purchase price consisted of 31,954,236 shares of the Company's common stock, 3 million five-year options
to purchase additional shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $0.15 - $0.35 per share and which vest over two years
and 49% of MariMed's outstanding equity. The fair value of the common stock issued was $5,911,534 determined by the fair value
of the Company s Common Stock on the closing date, at a price of approximately $0.185 per share. The fair value of the stock
options was $569,682 measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the grant date, assuming approximately 1.56% risk-free
interest, 0% dividend yield, 311% volatility, and expected life of five years. The fair value of common stock issued and options
granted for acquisition over the book value of Sigal is recorded as goodwill, which was subsequently impaired in full. One of the
owners of Sigal, Robert Fireman, is a director of the Company. 

 Subsequent Events 

 The Company evaluated for subsequent
events through the issuance date of the Company s financial statements. 

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This amendment outlines 
 a   single   comprehensive 
 model   for   entities 
 to   use   in 
 accounting   for   revenue 
 arising   from   contracts 
 with   customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including
industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model   is 
 that    an   entity 
 recognizes   revenue   to 
 depict   the   transfer 
 of   promised   goods 
 or   services   to 
 customers   in   an 
 amount   that   reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance applies to all contracts
with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in GAAP. This amendment is effective for annual reporting 
 periods,   including interim   reporting 
 periods   within   those 
 periods,   beginning   after 
 December   15,   2016, 
 and   is   not 
 expected   to have   a 
 material   impact   on 
 the   Company s   unaudited 
 interim Consolidated Financial   Statements. 

 The Company has reviewed all recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements up to ASU 2015-16, and does not believe the future adoption of any such
pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has had only minimal revenues from
operations, has a negative working capital, has a negative stockholders deficit and negative cash flows from operations. There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the substantial additional capital resources necessary to fully implement
its business plan or that any assumptions relating to its business plan will prove to be accurate. The Company is pursuing sources
of additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to the Company on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. Any inability to obtain additional financing will likely have a material adverse effect on the Company,
including possibly requiring the Company to reduce and/or cease operations. 

These factors raise substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

filings by the Company with the Commission, the words or phrases such as  anticipate,   believe,   could, 
 estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   plan,   predict,   project, 
 will  or similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking
statements, each of which speak only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The Company has
no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated
or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements. 

These forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different. These factors
include, but are not limited to, changes that may occur to general economic and business conditions; changes in current pricing
levels that we can charge for our services or which we pay to our suppliers and business partners; changes in political, social
and economic conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate; changes to regulations that pertain to our operations; changes
in technology that render our technology relatively inferior, obsolete or more expensive compared to others; changes in the business prospects of our business partners and customers; increased competition, including from our business partners;
delays in the delivery of broadband capacity to the homes and offices of persons who use our services; general disruptions to Internet
service; the loss of customer faith in the Internet as a means of commerce; and the legality of marijuana. 

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes which are included under Item 1. 

We do not undertake to update our forward-looking
statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances. 

Overview   

General   

We currently operate in two separate
segments with one segment being a 3D entertainment portal which leverages its proprietary licensed technology to offer visitors
a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call  worlds  and the second segment being a management company
in the medical cannabis industry operating through a subsidiary, MariMed. 

 We were formed on January 25,
2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Worlds Inc. (formerly known as Worlds.com Inc.). Effective May 16, 2011 Worlds Inc. transferred
to us the majority of its operations and related operational assets, except for its patent portfolio. Worlds Inc. has also given
us a perpetual world-wide license to its patented technology. Pursuant to the license and we have the right to issue unlimited
sublicenses to the licensed technology, subject to Worlds Inc. s reasonable consent. 

 The assets transferred to us include:
Worlds Inc. s technology platform, Worlds Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related
revenue, the following URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D
objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures. 

 The transfer of assets occurred
in the context of the spin-off by Worlds Inc. of its online and operational technologies businesses to us. The spin-off was effectuated
by Worlds Inc. declaring a dividend of its shares of its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Worlds Online, Inc. with each share of Worlds
Inc. to receive 1/3 of a share of Worlds Online with all fractional shares rounded up. Worlds Inc. did not want a trading market
to develop for its shares until the SEC completed its review of its registration statement on Form 10. Accordingly, the actual
distribution of the dividend did not occur until the payment date of March 12, 2012. Our stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.
Approximately 23,859,248 shares were issued as part of the dividend distribution and immediately following the distribution Worlds
Inc. continued to own approximately 19.6% of our outstanding shares. Worlds Inc. intends to dispose of its stock in an orderly
fashion into the open market or in private sales, in either case in ways designed not to impact the market, but in any event within
five years of the dividend payment debt if reasonably practical. While it holds any of our shares it will vote them in proportion
to the votes by other stockholders. 

 On May 19, 2014, Worlds Online
Inc. (the  Company ) entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) between MariMed
Advisors Inc. ( MariMed ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Sigal Consulting LLC ( Sigal ), a
Massachusetts limited liability company, and the Members of Sigal ( Sellers ). The transaction closed on September
29, 2014. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company, through MariMed, acquired all of the assets of Sigal and the Sellers received
the aggregate amount of (i) the Company s common stock (WORX) equal to 50% of the Company s outstanding common stock
on the Closing Date; (ii) three million options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock which are exercisable over
five years with various exercise prices ranging from $0.15 to $0.35 and (iii) 49% of MariMed s outstanding common stock.
As a result, the Company s ownership of MariMed was reduced from 100% to 51%.

Revenues   

Revenues are primarily generated
by our cannabis consulting business with our 3D business contributing just a negligible amount. 

 With our acquisition of Sigal
by our MariMed subsidiary, revenue was generated through sub leasing agreements with medical marijuana companies and consulting
agreements with services being performed during the period. MariMed enters into consulting agreements to help entities attain medical
marijuana licenses and provides services in the development and management of state licensed medical marijuana facilities. Our
professional management team has developed best practices and standard operating procedures for cultivation and dispensing of medical
cannabis. We also enter into rental agreements whereby we purchase or sublease space which we then rent to medical marijuana companies
who would otherwise not have the resources to finance their operations. 

 Our 3D business receives revenues
from VIP membership fees, typically $2 - $6 per month, charged to users for either an enhanced avatar with additional virtual clothes
and virtual goods or access to VIP only areas of the virtual World. To illustrate, in Worlds Inc. creation of Aerosmith World,
only VIP members have access to Steven Tyler s studio and his secret world, providing VIP members a greater opportunity to
meet Mr. Tyler when he is online as well as mingle with other VIP guests and watch Aerosmith music videos in the VIP media lounge.
Our 3D business can also potentially derive revenues from the entry into development agreement with clients in which a development,
license and maintenance fee is paid for the creation and administration of a 3D virtual world to be offered to a select user base. 

 Our financial statements currently
reflect an entry called  deferred revenue . This is specific to the conversion of a note Worlds Inc. issued to Pearson
PLC in 1996 in the initial face amount of $1,263,900. Pearson has agreed to forgive 50% of the note and convert the balance of
the note into deferred revenue for products and services Worlds Inc. develops for Pearson in the form of virtual worlds for training
and distant learning. Each product Worlds Inc. develops for Pearson has been reviewed and accepted by a senior Pearson executive
as part of an ongoing internal sales and capabilities program between various divisions within Pearson. As part of the Spinoff
we assumed this obligation and intend to continue to pay down the debt by providing additional products and services.    

  Expenses   

We classify our expenses into two broad
groups: 

 o cost of revenues; and 

 o selling, general and administration.     

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We raised $950,000
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 from issuing notes payable and we converted $589,332 in notes payable and
interest payable into equity in Mia Development Class A shares in order to fund MariMed s business
operations.  We expect to continue to pursue additional sources of capital though we have no current arrangements
with respect to, or sources of, additional financing at this time and there can be no assurance that any such financing will
become available.  

 MariMed raised $1.525 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to fund business operations.

 Other expenses include options expense
to directors and an officer of the Company of $77,820 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0 for the three months
ended June 30, 2016. Decrease is due to the Directors receiving their options during the three months ended June 30, 2015 whereby
the directors have not received their options yet for 2016. 

We had an unrealized gain on trading
securities of $314 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to an unrealized loss on trading securities of $375 during

 Payroll and related taxes for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $91,029 to $239,452 from $330,481. The decrease is primarily due to two less
