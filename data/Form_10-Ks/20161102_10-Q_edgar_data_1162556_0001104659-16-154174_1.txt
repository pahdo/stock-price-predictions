  References in this document to  we,   us  and  our  mean Dover Downs Gaming   Entertainment, Inc. and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, as appropriate.  
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and accordingly do not include all of the information and disclosures required for audited financial statements.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 4, 2016.  In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  Operating results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
     
   NOTE 2 - Business Operations   
     
  We are a premier gaming and entertainment resort destination whose operations consist of:  
     
                        Dover Downs Casino   a 165,000-square foot casino complex featuring popular table games, including craps, roulette and card games such as blackjack, Spanish 21, baccarat, 3-card and pai gow poker, the latest in slot machine offerings, multi-player electronic table games, a poker room, a Race   Sports Book operation, the Dover Downs  Fire   Ice Lounge, the Festival Buffet, Doc Magrogan s Oyster House, Frankie s Italian restaurant, as well as several bars, restaurants and four retail outlets; 
     
                        Dover Downs Hotel and Conference Center   a 500 room AAA Four Diamond hotel with a fine dining restaurant, full-service spa/salon, conference, banquet, ballroom and concert hall facilities; and 
     
                        Dover Downs Raceway   a harness racing track with pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races. 
     
  All of our gaming operations are located at our entertainment complex in Dover, the capital of the State of Delaware.  
     
  Dover Downs, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, is authorized to conduct video lottery, sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations as one of three  Licensed Agents  under the Delaware State Lottery Code.  Licensing, administration and control of gaming operations in Delaware is under the Delaware State Lottery Office and Delaware s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement.  
     
  Our license from the Delaware Harness Racing Commission (the  Commission ) to hold harness race meetings on our premises and to offer pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races must be renewed on an annual basis.  In order to maintain our gaming license, we are required to maintain our harness horse racing license.  We have received an annual license from the Commission for the past 47 consecutive years and management believes that our relationship with the Commission remains good.  
     
  Due to the nature of our business activities, we are subject to various federal, state and local regulations.  As part of our license arrangements, we are subject to various taxes and fees which are subject to change by the Delaware legislature.  
     
 5   

In recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced an unprecedented expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings.  This has had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability.  Management has estimated that approximately 30% of our gaming win comes from Maryland patrons and approximately 63% of our Capital Club  member gaming win comes from out of state patrons.  
     
  In 2013, the State enacted a bond and capital improvements bill which, among other things, created a Lottery   Gaming Study Commission responsible for examining the competitive marketplace confronting the Delaware gaming industry, including the business performance and business plans of existing lottery agents, the marketing efforts and investments made by Delaware video lottery agents, and the division of revenue from the video lottery, sports lottery, table games and internet gaming.  In 2014, the Delaware legislature approved the Commission s recommendation for the State to share certain vendor costs that the three Delaware video lottery agents pay associated with slot machines.  
     
  The Commission reconvened in September 2014 to consider previous and make further recommendations relative to the gaming industry.  The Commission s findings and recommendations were released in January 2015 and included: increasing the State s share of vendor costs associated with slot machines; eliminating the annual table game license fee; reducing the State s share of table game win; and providing each video lottery agent a credit of up to 5% of video lottery proceeds to be used for marketing expenditures and a credit of up to 5% of video lottery proceeds to be used for capital expenditures.  Delaware State Senate Bill 30 was introduced in January 2015 in order to implement the Commission s recommendations, but it was not released from the Senate Finance Committee for action.  In January 2016, Senate Bill 183 was introduced to phase in some of the Commission s recommendations over the next four years and to authorize internet sports betting in Delaware, but it was not acted upon prior to the end of the 2016 legislative session.  
     
  Without legislative relief, we may be unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our credit facility on favorable terms or may default on our obligations, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to marketing and promotions in order to compete effectively in the regional marketplace, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to maintaining our facility, and we may be required to take other actions in order to manage expenses - especially with respect to operations that have operated at a loss, such as table games.  Such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  
     
   NOTE 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Property and equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the asset s estimated useful life.  Accumulated depreciation was $135,928,000 and $130,869,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
     
  We perform reviews for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows.  
     
   Point loyalty program   We currently have a point loyalty program for our customers which allows them to earn points based on the volume of their gaming activity.  All reward points earned by customers are expensed in the period they are earned.  The estimated amount of points redeemable for cash is recorded as a reduction of gaming revenue and the estimated amount of points redeemable for services and merchandise is recorded as gaming expense.  In determining the amount of the liability, which was $1,649,000 and $1,660,000, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we estimate a redemption rate, a cost of rewards to be offered and the mix of cash, goods and services for which reward points will be redeemed.  We use historical data to estimate those amounts. 
     
   Revenue and expense recognition   Gaming revenues represent (i) the net win from slot machine, table games, internet gaming and sports wagering and (ii) commissions from pari-mutuel wagering.  Other operating revenues consist of hotel rooms revenue, food and beverage sales and other miscellaneous income.  Revenues do not include the retail amount of hotel rooms, food and beverage and other miscellaneous goods and services provided without charge to customers as promotional items of $4,998,000 and $14,152,000, and $5,074,000 and $13,368,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The estimated direct cost of providing these items has been charged to the casino through interdepartmental allocations and is included in gaming expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
     
 6   

For the casino operations, the difference between the amount wagered by bettors and the amount paid out to bettors is referred to as the win.  The win is included in the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as gaming revenue.  The Delaware State Lottery Office sweeps the win from the casino operations, collects the State s share of the win and the amount due to the vendors under contract with the State who provide the slot machines and associated computer systems, collects the amount allocable to purses for harness horse racing and remits the remainder to us as our commission for acting as a Licensed Agent.  Gaming expenses include the amounts collected by the State (i) for the State s share of the win, (ii) for remittance to the providers of the slot machines and associated computer systems, and (iii) for harness horse racing purses.  We recognize revenues from sports wagering commissions when the event occurs.  We recognize revenues from pari-mutuel commissions earned from live harness horse racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks when the race occurs. Revenues from hotel rooms, food and beverage sales and other miscellaneous income are recognized at the time the service is provided.  Amounts received in advance for hotel rooms, convention bookings and advance ticket sales are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are provided to the customer, at which point revenue is recognized.  
     
   Advertising costs   Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred.  Advertising expenses were $642,000 and $1,673,000, and $625,000 and $1,687,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
     
   Net earnings per common share   Nonvested share-based payment awards that include rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities, and the two-class method of computing basic and diluted net earnings per common share ( EPS )  is applied for all periods presented.  The following table sets forth the computation of EPS (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

There were no options outstanding and we paid no dividends during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  
     
   Accounting for stock-based compensation   We recorded stock-based compensation expense for our restricted stock awards of $75,000 and $252,000, and $90,000 and $285,000 as general and administrative expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We recorded income tax benefit (expense) of $31,000 and $(16,000), and $37,000 and ($56,000) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to our restricted stock awards. 
     
   Recent accounting pronouncements   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a five step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition.  This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently analyzing the impact of ASU No. 2014-09 on our results of operations and, at this time, we are unable to determine the impact on the new standard, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. 
     
 7   

NOTE 4   Credit Facility   
     
  On September 1, 2016, we modified our credit agreement with our bank group.  The credit facility was modified to: extend the maturity date to September 30, 2017; adjust the maximum borrowing limit from $40,000,000 to $35,000,000 as of March 31, 2017 and through the date of maturity; modify the maximum ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (the  leverage ratio  and delete the minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirement and the minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization requirement.  The credit facility also contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.  Material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to satisfy these requirements.  Interest is based upon LIBOR plus a margin that varies between 150 and 350 basis points (200 basis points at September 30, 2016) depending on the leverage ratio.  The credit facility is secured by a mortgage on and security interest in all real and personal property owned by Dover Downs, Inc.  In addition, the credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause and prohibits the payment of dividends.  The credit facility provides for seasonal funding needs, capital improvements and other general corporate purposes.  At September 30, 2016, there was $27,500,000 outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.53% and $12,500,000 was available pursuant to the facility.  Additionally, we were in compliance with all terms of the facility at September 30, 2016 and we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants, and all other covenants, for all measurement periods through September 30, 2017, the expiration date of the facility.  
     
  The credit facility is classified as a current liability as of September 30, 2016 in our consolidated balance sheets as the facility expires on September 30, 2017.  We will seek to refinance or extend the maturity of this obligation prior to its expiration date; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to execute this refinancing or extension or, if we are able to refinance or extend this obligation, that the terms of such refinancing or extension would be as favorable as the terms of our existing credit facility.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  
     
   NOTE 5   Pension Plans   
     
  We maintain a non-contributory, tax qualified defined benefit pension plan that has been frozen since July 2011.  All of our full time employees were eligible to participate in this qualified pension plan.  Benefits provided by our qualified pension plan were based on years of service and employees  remuneration over their term of employment.  Compensation earned by employees up to July 31, 2011 is used for purposes of calculating benefits under our pension plan with no future benefit accruals after this date.  We also maintain a non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, the excess plan, for certain employees that has been frozen since July 2011.  This excess plan provided benefits that would otherwise be provided under the qualified pension plan but for maximum benefit and compensation limits applicable under federal tax law.  The cost associated with the excess plan is determined using the same actuarial methods and assumptions as those used for our qualified pension plan. The assets for the excess plan aggregate $303,000 and $287,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets (see NOTE 7   Fair Value Measurements).  
     
  The components of net periodic pension benefit for our defined benefit pension plans are as follows:  

8   

We contributed $70,000 and $160,000 to our defined benefit pension plans during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  We expect to contribute an additional $50,000 to our defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2016.  We contributed $283,000 and $353,000 to our defined benefit pension plans during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  We also maintain a non-elective, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan ( SERP ) which provides deferred compensation to certain highly compensated employees that approximates the value of benefits lost by the freezing of the pension plan which are not offset by our enhanced matching contribution in our 401(k)  plan.  The SERP is a discretionary defined contribution plan and contributions made to the SERP in any given year are not guaranteed and will be at the sole discretion of our Compensation and Stock Incentive Committee.  During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded expenses of $20,000 and $66,000, and $30,000 and $90,000, respectively, related to the SERP.  During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we contributed $0 and $99,000, and $0 and $126,000 to the plan, respectively.  The liability for SERP pension benefits was $64,000 and $97,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  We maintain a defined contribution 401(k) plan which permits participation by substantially all employees.  Our matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $216,000 and $601,000, and $230,000 and $658,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   NOTE 6   Stockholders  Equity   
     
  Changes in the components of stockholders  equity are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of the following:  

On January 23, 2013, our Board of Directors suspended the quarterly dividend.  In addition, our credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends.  See NOTE 4   Credit Facility.  
     
  On October 23, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3,000,000 shares of our outstanding common stock.  The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as conditions warrant.  The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time.  No purchases of our equity securities were made pursuant to this authorization during the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.  At September 30, 2016, we had remaining repurchase authority of 1,653,333 shares.  At present we are not permitted to make such purchases under our credit facility.  
     
 9   

We have a stock incentive plan which provides for the grant of up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock to our officers and key employees through stock options and/or awards valued in whole or in part by reference to our common stock, such as nonvested restricted stock awards.  Under the plan, nonvested restricted stock vests an aggregate of twenty percent each year beginning on the second anniversary date of the grant.  The aggregate market value of the nonvested restricted stock at the date of issuance is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the six-year period.  We granted 220,500 and 227,000 stock awards under this plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,258,465 shares available for granting options or stock awards.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we purchased and retired 67,555 and 73,453 shares of our outstanding common stock for $66,000 and $65,000, respectively.  These purchases were made from employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards under our stock incentive plan and were not pursuant to the aforementioned repurchase authorization.  Since the vesting of a restricted stock award is a taxable event to our employees for which income tax withholding is required, the plan allows employees to surrender to us some of the shares that would otherwise have vested in satisfaction of their tax liability.  The surrender of these shares is treated by us as a purchase of the shares.  
     
   NOTE 7   Fair Value Measurements   
     
  Our financial instruments are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  
     
  Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;  
     
  Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;  
     
  Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).  
     
  The following table summarizes the valuation of our financial instrument pricing levels as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Our investments in available-for-sale securities consist of mutual funds.  These investments are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.  
     
  The carrying amounts of other financial instruments reported in our consolidated balance sheets for current assets and current liabilities approximates their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $27,500,000 and $31,500,000, respectively, outstanding under our revolving credit agreement.  The borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at the variable rate described in NOTE 4   Credit Facility and therefore we believe approximate fair value.  
     
 10   

NOTE 8 - Related Party Transactions   
     
  During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we allocated costs of $487,000 and $1,482,000, and $453,000 and $1,399,000, respectively, to Dover Motorsports, Inc. ( DVD ), a company related through common ownership, for certain administrative and operating services, including leased space.  DVD allocated certain administrative and operating service costs of $24,000 and $135,000, and $39,000 and $168,000, respectively, to us for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The allocations were based on an analysis of each company s share of the costs.  In connection with DVD s 2016 and 2015 NASCAR event weekends at Dover International Speedway, we provided certain services, primarily catering, for which DVD was invoiced $71,000 and $497,000, and $4,000 and $426,000 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Additionally, DVD invoiced us $25,000 and $116,000, and $8,000 and $119,000 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, for tickets, their commission for suite catering and other services to the NASCAR events.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheets included a $44,000 receivable from and a $44,000 payable to DVD for the aforementioned items.  These items were settled in October 2016 and January 2016, respectively.  The net costs incurred by each company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the companies had been unrelated entities and/or had otherwise independently managed these functions; however, management believes that these costs are reasonable.  
     
  Prior to our spin-off from DVD in 2002, both companies shared certain real property in Dover, Delaware.  At the time of the spin-off, some of this real property was transferred to us to ensure that the real property holdings of each company was aligned with its past uses and future business needs.  During our harness racing season, we have historically used the 5/8-mile harness racing track that is located on DVD s property and is on the inside of its one-mile motorsports superspeedway.  In order to continue this historic use, DVD granted a perpetual easement to the harness track to us at the time of the spin-off.  This perpetual easement allows us to have exclusive use of the harness track during the period beginning November 1 of each year and ending April 30 of the following year, together with set up and tear down rights for the two weeks before and after such period.  The easement requires that we maintain the harness track but does not require the payment of any rent.  
     
  Various easements and agreements relative to access, utilities and parking have also been entered into between us and DVD relative to our respective Dover, Delaware facilities.  DVD pays rent to us for the lease of its principal executive office space.  We also allow DVD to use our indoor grandstands in connection with DVD s two annual motorsports weekends.  We do not assess rent for this nominal use and may discontinue the use at our discretion.  
     
  Henry B. Tippie, Chairman of our Board of Directors, controls in excess of fifty percent of our voting power.  Mr. Tippie s voting control emanates from his direct and indirect holdings of common stock and Class A common stock, from his status as trustee of the RMT Trust, our largest stockholder, and from certain shares as to which he has voting rights pursuant to a voting agreement with R. Randall Rollins, one of our directors.  This means that Mr. Tippie has the ability to determine the outcome of our election of directors and to determine the outcome of many significant corporate transactions, many of which only require the approval of a majority of our voting power.  
     
  Patrick J. Bagley, Timothy R. Horne, Denis McGlynn, Jeffrey W. Rollins, R. Randall Rollins, Richard K. Struthers and Henry B. Tippie are all Directors of ours and DVD.  Denis McGlynn is the President and Chief Executive Officer of both companies, Klaus M. Belohoubek is the Senior Vice President   General Counsel and Secretary of both companies and Timothy R. Horne is the Senior Vice President   Finance and Chief Financial Officer of both companies.  Mr. Tippie controls in excess of fifty percent of the voting power of DVD.  
     
   NOTE 9   Commitments and Contingencies   
     
  We are a party to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business.  Management does not believe that the resolution of any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Item 2.                                        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
     
  The following discussion is based upon and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.  
     
  Dover Downs Gaming   Entertainment, Inc. is a premier gaming and entertainment resort destination whose operations consist of:  
     
                        Dover Downs Casino   a 165,000-square foot casino complex featuring popular table games, including craps, roulette and card games such as blackjack, Spanish 21, baccarat, 3-card and pai gow poker, the latest in slot machine offerings, multi-player electronic table games, a poker room, a Race   Sports Book operation, the Dover Downs  Fire   Ice Lounge, the Festival Buffet, Doc Magrogan s Oyster House, Frankie s Italian restaurant, as well as several bars, restaurants and four retail outlets; 
     
                        Dover Downs Hotel and Conference Center   a 500 room AAA Four Diamond hotel with a fine dining restaurant, full-service spa/salon, conference, banquet, ballroom and concert hall facilities; and 
     
                        Dover Downs Raceway   a harness racing track with pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races. 
     
  All of our gaming operations are located at our entertainment complex in Dover, the capital of the State of Delaware.  
     
  Approximately 87% of our revenue is gaming revenue.  Several factors contribute to the win for any gaming company, including, but not limited to:  
     
                        Proximity to major population bases, 
                        Competition in the market, 
                        The quantity and types of slot machines and table games available, 
                        The quality of the physical property, 
                        Other amenities offered on site, 
                        Customer service levels, 
                        Marketing programs, and 
                        General economic conditions. 
     
  Our entertainment complex is located in Dover, the capital of the State of Delaware.  We draw patrons from several major metropolitan areas. Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. are all within a two hour drive.  According to the 2010 United States Census, approximately 36.8 million people live within 150 miles of our complex.  There are significant barriers to entry related to the gaming business in Delaware.  By law, currently only the three existing horse racing facilities in the State are allowed to have a video lottery gaming license.  In recent years, additional gaming venues have opened in Maryland and Pennsylvania and more are expected to open.  These venues are having a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability.  Our property is similar to properties found in the country s largest gaming markets.  Our luxury hotel is the only casino-hotel in Delaware, providing a strong marketing tool, especially to higher-end players.  We also utilize our recently enhanced slot marketing system to allow for more efficient marketing programs and the highest levels of customer service.  Our facility offers approximately 41,500 square feet of multi-use event space   the most space of any hotel in Delaware.  
     
  Because all of our gaming operations are located at one facility, we face the risk of increased competition from the legalization of new or additional gaming venues.  We have therefore focused on creating a premier gaming and entertainment resort destination and building and rewarding customer loyalty through innovative marketing efforts, unparalleled customer service and a variety of amenities.

Results of Operations   
     
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
  Gaming revenues decreased by $717,000, or 1.7%, to $41,295,000 in the third quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of lower slot machine play.  
     
  Other operating revenues were $5,815,000 in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $5,184,000 in the third quarter of 2015.  Rooms revenue increased $198,000 to $1,494,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from $1,296,000 in the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to the timing of Dover International Speedway s fall NASCAR race weekend which was held on September 30   October 2 of 2016 but was held on October 2   4 of 2015, as well as increased transient and tour   travel sales.  Food and beverage revenues increased $363,000 to $3,034,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from $2,671,000 in the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to higher banquet sales and the opening of a new food and beverage outlet in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Other operating revenues do not include the retail amount of promotional allowances which are provided to customers on a complimentary basis of $4,998,000 and $5,074,000 in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Gaming expenses decreased slightly as a result of the lower gaming revenues, partially offset by increased marketing and employee benefit costs.  
     
  Other operating expenses increased to $3,895,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from $3,551,000 in the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to higher expenses in our food and beverage operations.  
     
  General and administrative expenses decreased to $1,228,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from $1,331,000 in the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower employee wage and benefit costs and lower legal fees.  
     
  Depreciation expense decreased to $1,959,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from $2,030,000 in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated.  
     
  Interest expense decreased by $45,000 primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2016.  
     
  Our effective income tax rate was 34.9% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 13.7% in the third quarter of 2015.  The lower effective rate in the third quarter of 2015 resulted from a discrete item relating to a federal income tax credit for payroll taxes incurred on customer tips paid to our employees.  
     
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
  Gaming revenues increased by $865,000, or 0.7%, to $119,711,000 in the first nine months of 2016 primarily as a result of a higher table game hold percentage, as well as smaller increases in other gaming revenues.  These increases were partially offset by lower slot machine play.  
     
  Other operating revenues were $18,340,000 in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to $17,989,000 in the first nine months of 2015.  Food and beverage revenues increased $378,000 to $10,423,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $10,045,000 in the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to the opening of a new food and beverage outlet in the fourth quarter of 2015 and higher sales in our Festival Buffet and higher banquet sales.  These increases were partially offset by lower revenues in other food and beverage outlets.  Rooms revenue decreased $241,000 to $4,442,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $4,683,000 in the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to lower convention sales, partially offset by higher sales as a result of the aforementioned timing of Dover International Speedway s fall NASCAR race weekend, as well as increased tour   travel and transient sales.  During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized revenue of $269,000 in connection with the termination and settlement of a lease related to retail space at our facility.  As a result of terminating the lease, we subsequently began operating the five existing retail outlets.  Revenues from these outlets increased $222,000 in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Additionally, other casino revenues were higher in the first nine months of 2016.  Other operating revenues do not include the retail amount of promotional allowances which are provided to customers on a complimentary basis of $14,152,000 and $13,368,000 in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
 13   

Gaming expenses increased by $1,547,000, or 1.4%, primarily as a result of the higher gaming revenues, increased marketing and higher employee benefit costs.  
     
  Other operating expenses increased to $12,594,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $11,957,000 in the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to higher expenses in our food and beverage operations and expenses related to the retail operations we began to operate in the second quarter of 2015.  
     
  General and administrative expenses decreased to $3,851,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $4,165,000 in the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to employee separation costs and higher legal fees incurred in the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  Depreciation expense decreased to $5,799,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $6,353,000 in the first nine months of 2015 as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated.  
     
  Interest expense decreased by $276,000 primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings and a lower average interest rate in the first nine months of 2016.  
     
  Our effective income tax rate was 43.2% in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 35.7% in the first nine months of 2015.  The rates were primarily impacted by the non-deductible portion of the restricted stock awards that vested during the first quarter of 2016 and 2015.  Additionally, the effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2015 was impacted by a discrete item relating to a federal income tax credit for payroll taxes incurred on customer tips paid to our employees.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $7,346,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $5,337,000 in the first nine months of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors and lower income tax and interest payments during the first nine months of 2016.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities was $2,472,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1,121,000 in the first nine months of 2015 and was primarily related to capital improvements in both periods.  Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 related primarily to information systems and facility and equipment upgrades.  
     
  Net cash used in financing activities was $4,106,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $5,508,000 in the first nine months of 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, we had net repayments of $4,000,000 on our credit facility compared to $5,350,000 during the first nine months of 2015.  We repurchased and retired $66,000 and $65,000 of our outstanding common stock during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These purchases were made from employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards under our stock incentive plan.  As a result of amending our credit agreement in September 2016 and 2015, we paid $40,000 and $93,000 in bank fees, respectively.  
     
  On October 23, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3,000,000 shares of our outstanding common stock.  The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as conditions warrant.  The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time.  No purchases of our equity securities were made pursuant to this authorization during the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.  At September 30, 2016, we had remaining repurchase authority of 1,653,333 shares. At present we are not permitted to make such purchases under our credit facility.  
     
  Based on current business conditions, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $500,000 - $1,000,000 during the remainder of 2016.  Additionally, we expect to contribute an additional $50,000 to our defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2016.  
     
 14   

On September 1, 2016, we modified our credit agreement with our bank group.  The credit facility was modified to: extend the maturity date to September 30, 2017; adjust the maximum borrowing limit from $40,000,000 to $35,000,000 as of March 31, 2017 and through the date of maturity; modify the maximum ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (the  leverage ratio  and delete the minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirement and the minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization requirement.  The credit facility also contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.  Material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to satisfy these requirements.  Interest is based upon LIBOR plus a margin that varies between 150 and 350 basis points (200 basis points at September 30, 2016) depending on the leverage ratio.  The credit facility is secured by a mortgage on and security interest in all real and personal property owned by Dover Downs, Inc.  In addition, the credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause and prohibits the payment of dividends.  The credit facility provides for seasonal funding needs, capital improvements and other general corporate purposes.  At September 30, 2016, there was $27,500,000 outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.53% and $12,500,000 was available pursuant to the facility.  Additionally, we were in compliance with all terms of the facility at September 30, 2016 and we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants, and all other covenants, for all measurement periods through September 30, 2017, the expiration date of the facility.  
     
  The credit facility is classified as a current liability as of September 30, 2016 in our consolidated balance sheets as the facility expires on September 30, 2017.  We will seek to refinance or extend the maturity of this obligation prior to its expiration date; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to execute this refinancing or extension or, if we are able to refinance or extend this obligation, that the terms of such refinancing or extension would be as favorable as the terms of our existing credit facility.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  
     
  While we believe that our net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future, we will need to refinance or extend the maturity of our outstanding credit facility prior to its expiration on September 30, 2017.  
     
  In recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced an unprecedented expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings.  These new venues   particularly a large casino at Arundel Mills Mall in Maryland which opened in June 2012 with slot machines and subsequently added table games in April 2013   have had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability. Management has estimated that approximately 30% of our gaming win comes from Maryland patrons and approximately 63% of our Capital Club  member gaming win comes from out-of-state patrons.  
     
  The Delaware legislature has worked with the gaming industry in recent years to increase the State s gaming offerings, but it has done so while steadily increasing the State s share of the industry s gaming revenues and adding to various costs that the industry incurs to do business.  In July 2008, the State s share of our gaming revenues was increased.  In May 2009, an additional and significant increase in the State s share of our gaming revenues was legislated in connection with the reintroduction of limited sports betting in the State.  This was the fifth increase in the State s share of gaming revenues.  In January 2010, the State authorized table games, but imposed a license fee and a high tax rate on table game revenues.  During this period, our revenues declined and our ability to compete with the growing number of competitors in the mid-Atlantic region was impeded.  In recognition of the State s high gaming tax burden and its effect on the industry, legislators have attempted several times since 2011 to reduce this tax burden in an effort to stabilize the industry, preserve jobs and protect the State s revenue stream.  
     
  In June 2012, the State enacted the Delaware Gaming Competitiveness Act of 2012 (the  Act ), under which Delaware s video lottery agents are authorized to offer, through their websites, internet versions of their table games (including poker and bingo) and video lottery offerings.  All games remain under the control and operation of the Delaware Lottery.  Revenues from the internet versions of table games and video lottery games are distributed generally pursuant to the formula currently applicable to those games physically located within our casino, with the exception that internet service provider costs are deducted first, and the Delaware Lottery retains the first $3.75 million of state-wide net proceeds.  We began offering internet gaming in the fourth quarter of 2013; to date operating results from internet gaming have not been material.  Internet lottery games are, at least initially, offered solely to persons located within the State of Delaware.  This territorial limitation would not apply to gaming pursuant to an interstate compact, such as the one announced in February 2014 between Delaware and Nevada.  Internet gaming participation is limited to persons who meet the age requirements for equivalent non-internet games.  The Act also eliminated the gaming license fee and restructured the table game license fee currently paid by video lottery agents to incentivize agents to make capital expenditures, spend on marketing and promotions, and make debt service payments.  
     
 15   

In 2013, the State enacted a bond and capital improvements bill which, among other things, created a Lottery   Gaming Study Commission responsible for examining the competitive marketplace confronting the Delaware gaming industry, including the business performance and business plans of existing lottery agents, the marketing efforts and investments made by Delaware video lottery agents, and the division of revenue from the video lottery, sports lottery, table games and internet gaming.  In 2014, the Delaware legislature approved the Commission s recommendation for the State to share certain vendor costs that the three Delaware video lottery agents pay associated with slot machines.  
     
  The Commission reconvened in September 2014 to consider previous and make further recommendations relative to the gaming industry.  The Commission s findings and recommendations were released in January 2015 and included: increasing the State s share of vendor costs associated with slot machines; eliminating the annual table game license fee; reducing the State s share of table game win; and providing each video lottery agent a credit of up to 5% of video lottery proceeds to be used for marketing expenditures and a credit of up to 5% of video lottery proceeds to be used for capital expenditures.  Delaware State Senate Bill 30 was introduced in January 2015 in order to implement the Commission s recommendations, but it was not released from the Senate Finance Committee for action.  In January 2016, Senate Bill 183 was introduced to phase in some of the Commission s recommendations over the next four years and to authorize internet sports betting in Delaware, but it was not acted upon prior to the end of the 2016 legislative session.  
     
  Without legislative relief, we may be unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our credit facility on favorable terms or may default on our obligations, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to marketing and promotions in order to compete effectively in the regional marketplace, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to maintaining our facility, and we may be required to take other actions in order to manage expenses - especially with respect to operations that have operated at a loss, such as table games.  Such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  
     
   Contractual Obligations   
     
  At September 30, 2016, we had the following contractual obligations:  

(a) Our current credit facility expires on September 30, 2017.  
     
  (b) The future interest payments on our revolving credit agreement were estimated using the current outstanding principal as of September 30, 2016 and current interest rates through the expiration date.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.

   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
     
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   Part II   Other Information   
     
    Item 1.                                        Legal Proceedings

Documents incorporated by reference into this report may also contain forward-looking statements.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.

  These factors and cautionary statements apply to all future forward-looking statements we make.  Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Do not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements or project any future results based on such statements or on present or prior earnings levels.  
     
  Additional information concerning these, or other factors, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in our other SEC filings.  Copies of those filings are available from us and/or the SEC.  
     
   We Have a Significant Amount of Indebtedness   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had total outstanding long-term debt of $27,500,000 under our credit facility.  The facility is classified as a current liability as of September 30, 2016 in our consolidated balance sheets as the facility expires on September 30, 2017.  We will seek to refinance or extend the maturity of this obligation prior to its expiration date; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to execute this refinancing or extension or, if we are able to refinance or extend this obligation, that the terms of such refinancing or extension would be as favorable as the terms of our existing credit facility.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  This indebtedness and any future increases in our outstanding borrowings or decreases in our results of operations could:  
     
                        make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations; 
                        increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business; 
                        increase our costs or create difficulties in refinancing or replacing our outstanding obligations; 
                        require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes; 
                        limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
                        subject us to the risks that interest rates and our interest expense will increase; and 
                        place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less relative debt. 
     
  In addition, our credit facility contains financial ratios that we are required to meet and other restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to borrow additional funds, make acquisitions, create liens on our properties and make investments.  Our ability to meet these financial ratios and covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet them.  If there were an event of default under our credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable.  
     
  In recent years, additional gaming venues have had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability.  
     
 18   

Our Gaming Activities Compete Directly With Other Gaming Facilities And Other Entertainment Businesses   
     
  We compete in local and regional markets with casinos, horse tracks and racinos, off-track betting parlors, state run lotteries, internet gambling and other forms of gaming.  In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, collegiate and professional athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel.  Many of our gaming competitors are in jurisdictions with a closer proximity to large population bases and with a lower tax burden.  As gambling opportunities in the region continue to proliferate, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our state or regional market share or be able to compete effectively with our competitors and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and overall profitability.  
     
  The introduction or expansion of gaming in neighboring jurisdictions, particularly Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania or New Jersey, the proliferation of internet gaming or the legalization of additional gaming venues in Delaware, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.  Delaware is surrounded by jurisdictions which permit slot machines and table games, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia.  
     
  In recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced an unprecedented expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings and many analysts believe that the market is showing signs of saturation, in part due to the fact that new gaming venues often result in a substantial loss of business to existing locations.  This has had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability. Management has estimated that approximately 30% of our gaming win comes from Maryland patrons and approximately 63% of our Capital Club  member gaming win comes from out of state patrons.  
     
  All states in our geographic region have state-run lotteries.  State run lotteries are no longer prohibited by federal law from offering lottery products or other gaming opportunities over the internet or through mobile applications if permitted by state law.  
     
  Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have passed legislation authorizing internet gaming and other states are pursuing or exploring the legalization of internet gaming in various forms   from state run lotteries to privately run casino games, including online poker.  States are aggressively seeking new revenue streams through gaming.  New Jersey is also pursuing sports betting despite a federal law that prohibits it from doing so.  
     
   All Of Our Facilities Are In One Location   
     
  Our gaming facilities are located adjacent to one another at a single location in Dover, Delaware.  Any prolonged disruption of operations at these facilities due to damage or destruction, inclement weather, natural disaster, work stoppages or other reasons could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We maintain property and business interruption insurance to protect against certain types of disruption, but there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be adequate to repair or rebuild our facilities or to otherwise compensate us for lost profits.  
     
   The Revocation, Suspension Or Modification Of Our Gaming Licenses Would Adversely Affect Our Gaming Business   
     
  Licensing, administration and control of gaming operations in Delaware is under the Delaware State Lottery Office and Delaware s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement.  Our gaming license has no expiration date and does not need to be renewed annually.  However, to maintain our gaming license, we must remain licensed for harness horse racing by the Delaware Harness Racing Commission and conduct at least 80 live race days each racing season, subject to the availability of harness race horses.  Our license from the Racing Commission must be renewed on an annual basis.  The Racing Commission has broad discretion to reject any application for a license or suspend or revoke a license once it is issued.  The Director of the Delaware State Lottery Office has broad discretion to revoke, suspend or modify the terms of our gaming license.  Any modification or termination of existing licensing regulations or any revocation, suspension or modification of our licenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and overall profitability.  
     
 19   

Our Gaming Activities Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Any Additional Government Regulation Or Taxation Of Gaming Activities Could Substantially Reduce Our Revenue Or Profit   
     
  We believe that the prospect of significant additional tax revenue is one of the primary reasons why jurisdictions have legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes.  These taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time.  We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations and the State s share of our gaming win has been increased several times.  In addition, any material increase in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, may have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.  
     
  Slot machine gaming, table games, sports betting, internet gaming, harness horse racing and pari-mutuel wagering are subject to extensive government regulation.  Delaware law regulates the win we are entitled to retain and the percentage of commission we are entitled to receive from our gaming revenues, which comprises a significant portion of our overall revenues.  The State granted us a license to conduct our gaming operations and a license to conduct harness horse races and pari-mutuel wagering.  The laws under which these licenses are granted could be modified or repealed at any time and we could be required to terminate our gaming operations.  If we are required to terminate our gaming operations or if the amount of the commission we receive from the State for conducting our gaming operations is decreased, our business operations and overall profitability would be significantly impaired.  
     
  The Delaware legislature has worked with the gaming industry in recent years to increase the State s gaming offerings, but it has done so while steadily increasing the State s share of the industry s gaming revenues and adding to various costs that the industry incurs to do business.  In July 2008, the State s share of our gaming revenues was increased.  In May 2009, an additional and significant increase in the State s share of our gaming revenues was legislated in connection with the reintroduction of limited sports betting in the State.  This was the fifth increase in the State s share of gaming revenues.  In January 2010, the State authorized table games, but imposed a license fee and a high tax rate on table game revenues.  During this period, our revenues declined and our ability to compete with the growing number of competitors in the mid-Atlantic region was impeded.  In recognition of the State s high gaming tax burden and its effect on the industry, legislators have attempted several times since 2011 to reduce this tax burden in an effort to stabilize the industry, preserve jobs and protect the State s revenue stream.  
     
  Without legislative relief, we may be unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our credit facility on favorable terms or may default on our obligations, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to marketing and promotions in order to compete effectively in the regional marketplace, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to maintaining our facility, and we may be required to take other actions in order to manage expenses - especially with respect to operations that have operated at a loss, such as table games.  Such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  
     
  In June 2012, the State enacted the Delaware Gaming Competitiveness Act of 2012 (the  Act ), under which Delaware s video lottery agents are authorized to offer, through their websites, internet versions of their table games (including poker and bingo) and video lottery offerings.  There have been discussions in Congress to regulate various forms of internet gaming and it is possible that new federal laws may preempt state laws relative to the regulation or taxation of internet gaming.  Internet gaming may even be proscribed entirely by federal law much as sports betting is proscribed by federal law in all but four states.  
     
  We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations.  These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.  Laws and regulations governing the use and development of real estate may delay or complicate any improvements we choose to make and/or increase the costs of any improvements or our costs of operating.  
     
  If it is determined that damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment has been caused or exacerbated by the operation or conduct of our business or by pollutants, substances, contaminants or wastes used, generated or disposed of by us, or if pollutants, substances, contaminants or wastes are found on our property, we may be held liable for such damage and may be required to pay the cost of investigation and/or remediation of such contamination or any related damage.  
     
 20   

Laws and regulations are always subject to change, can be interpreted differently in the future, and new laws and regulations may be enacted which could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of our gaming operations.  Furthermore, noncompliance with one or more of these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial penalties against us or adversely affect our gaming license.  
     
   We Do Not Own Or Lease Our Slot Machines And Related Technology   
     
  We do not own or lease the slot machines or computer systems used by the State in connection with our video lottery gaming operations.  The Lottery Director enters into contracts directly with the providers of the slot machines and computer systems and we are not a party to those negotiations.  The State purchases or leases all equipment and the Lottery Director licenses all technology providers and we share in the expense.  Similarly, but at no expense to us, the Lottery Director contracts directly with service providers for internet gaming.  Our operations could be disrupted if a licensed technology provider violates its agreement with the State or ceases to be licensed for any reason.  Such an event would be outside of our control and could adversely affect our gaming revenues.  
     
   Due to Our Concentrated Stock Ownership, Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In Our Management   
     
  We have elected to be treated as a  controlled corporation  as defined by New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A.  We are a controlled corporation because a single person, Henry B. Tippie, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, controls in excess of fifty percent of our voting power.  This means that he has the ability to determine the outcome of the election of directors at our annual meetings and to determine the outcome of many significant corporate transactions, many of which only require the approval of a majority of our voting power.  Such a concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us at a premium.  In addition, as a controlled corporation, we are not required to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange rules.  
     
   Our Success Depends on the Availability and Performance of Key Personnel   
     
  Our continued success depends upon the availability and performance of our senior management team which possesses unique and extensive industry knowledge and experience.  Our inability to retain and attract key employees in the future could have a negative effect on our operations and business plans.  
     
  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments, events or conditions.  New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward-looking statements as an indication of our actual future results.  
     
    Item 2.                                        Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   
     
  On October 23, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3,000,000 shares of our outstanding common stock.  The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as conditions warrant.  The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time.  No purchases of our equity securities were made pursuant to this authorization during the first nine months of 2016.  At September 30, 2016, we had remaining repurchase authority of 1,653,333 shares.  At present we are not permitted to make such purchases under our credit facility.  
     
    Item 3.                                        Defaults Upon Senior Securities   
     
  None.
