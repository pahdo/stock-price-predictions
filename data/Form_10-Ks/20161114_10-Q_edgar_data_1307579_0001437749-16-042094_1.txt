FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
     
  Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements  regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations and market trends and expectations.  Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.  Our plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of our business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.  Although we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (   Continued)    
     
     Accounts Receivable     --  Accounts receivables consist of trade receivables arising in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects the Company s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.   
     
  The roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:  

Inventory     --  Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, as determined on the first-in, first-out method.  
     
   Property and Equipment     --  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized, upon being placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to ten years (See Note 4).  
     
   Long-Term Investments     --  Investments in non-consolidated companies are included in long-term investments in the consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for under the cost method and equity method. For these non-quoted investments, we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information requested from these privately held companies. Generally, this information may be more limited, may not be as timely as and may be less accurate than information available from publicly traded companies. Assessing each investment's carrying value requires significant judgment by management. If it is determined that there is an-other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of a non-public equity security, we write-down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in the consolidated statement of operations.  
     
   Intangible Assets     --  Definite life intangible assets include patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification, ( ASC ) Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  and amortized the patents on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of two to ten years.   
     
   Goodwill --  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of goodwill or a significant decrease in expected cash flows.  
     
   Revenue Recognition and Sales Incentives     --  The Company accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  (SAB 101), FASB ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when rights and risk of ownership have passed to the customer, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, product has been shipped or delivered to the customer, the price and terms are finalized, and collections of resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Products are primarily shipped FOB shipping point at which time title passes to the customer. In some instances, the Company uses common carriers for the delivery of products. In these arrangements, sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer. The Company's revenue arrangements with its customers often include early payment discounts and such sales incentives are recorded against sales.  
     
  The Company has received long-term contracts for the installation of various water filtrations systems and grants from government entities for development and use of silicon carbide membranes in various water filtration and treatment applications. Revenues from long-term contracts and grants are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of project costs incurred to date to estimated total project costs for each long-term contract or grant multiplied by the long-term contract or grant income on a project-by-project basis. This method is used because management considers costs incurred to be the best available measure of progress on contracts in process.  
          
  Project costs of the long-term contracts and grants include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to the project. Project costs are capitalized and accreted into cost of sales based on the percentage of the project completed. Should a loss be estimated on an incomplete project it would be recorded in the period in which such a loss is determined. Changes in estimated profitability of a project are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. The aggregate of costs incurred and income recognized on incomplete projects are recorded as costs in excess of billings and are shown as a current asset.  

11

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (   Continued)    
         
  The aggregate of billings in excess of related costs incurred and income recognized on projects is shown as a current liability.    
     
  In Denmark, Value Added Tax ( VAT ) of 25% of the invoice amount is collected in respect of the sales of goods on behalf of tax authorities. The VAT collected is not revenue of the Company; instead, the amount is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until such VAT is paid to the authorities.   
     
   Advertising Cost     --  Cost incurred in connection with advertising of the Company s products is expensed as incurred. Such costs amounted to $21,307 and $30,045 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   Research and Development Cost     --  The Company expenses research and development costs for the development of new products and systems as incurred. Included in operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $  476,734 and $536,614, respectively, of research and development costs.  
     
   Income Taxes     --  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes.  
     
   Income (Loss) Per Share     --  The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share (EPS) are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per common share are based on shares outstanding (computed as under basic EPS) and potentially dilutive common shares. Potential common shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation include in-the-money stock options and warrants that have been granted but have not been exercised.  
     
   Stock Options and Awards     --  The Company has granted stock options and awards to certain key employees and directors. See Note 13. The Company accounts for options in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. Non-cash compensation costs of $272,665 and $112,528 have been recognized for the vesting of options granted to employees with an associated recognized tax benefit of $43,699 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments     -- The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820. The authoritative guidance, which, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;     

Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and     

Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.     
     
  Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair value of the Company s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital lease obligations and notes payable approximates their recorded values due to their short-term maturities.  
      
   Accounting Estimates     --  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, cost in excess of billings, reserve for obsolete inventory, depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment and impairment of goodwill and liabilities billings in excess of cost commitment and contingencies, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements     --  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity  expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 

12

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (   Continued)    
         
  On July 9 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date by one year; accordingly, the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and we expect to adopt it at that time. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method, nor have we determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.   
      
  In 2015, the FASB issued an amended standard requiring that we classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and non-current. The amended standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is permitted and we are evaluating whether we will adopt early. The amended standard may be adopted on either a prospective or a retrospective basis. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting for leases that primarily affect presentation and disclosure requirements. The new standard will require the recognition of a right to use asset and underlying lease liability for operating leases with an initial life in excess of one year. This standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We have not yet determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.   
     
   NOTE 2 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   
      
  During March 2015, an officer of LiqTech NA provided $25,000 in non-interest bearing advances to the Company. These advances were repaid in May 2015.

Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of goodwill or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. Key variables included in evaluating goodwill for impairment include the pipeline of proposed potential customer sales, budgeted reoccurring sales, risk free interest rate and risk premium rate and future budgeted operating results. The Company recorded no impairment charge on goodwill, during the year ended December 31, 2015 as managements estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.

   NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES   
     
  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes; which requires the Company to provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to the expected future tax benefit or expense of temporary reporting differences between book and tax accounting and any available operating loss or tax credit carry forwards. The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the deferred tax assets for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the Company s future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which cannot be determined. In accordance with prevailing accounting guidance, the Company is required to recognize and disclose any income tax uncertainties. The guidance provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring tax benefits and liabilities when realization of the tax position is uncertain. The first step is to determine whether the tax position meets the more-likely-than-not condition for recognition and the second step is to determine the amount to be recognized based on the cumulative probability that exceeds 50%, Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
     
  Current tax planning strategies, including our new Business Plan strategy, have management estimating that it is more likely than not that the Danish business units will be able to generate pretax profit equal to or in excess of the net operating loss carryforwards. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carryovers of approximately $  11,411,643 for U.S. Federal purposes expiring through 2035  , approximately $3,073,833 for Danish tax purposes which do not expire  , approximately $464,002 for German tax purposes which do not expire and approximately $602,860 for Singapore tax purposes which do not expire.      
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company established a valuation allowance of $3,631,910 and $228,170, respectively for the tax paying components of LiqTech International Inc., LiqTech NA, LiqTech Singapore and LiqTech Germany as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that sufficient income could be generated by these components to realize the resulting net operating loss carry forwards of these components.  The change in the valuation for the period ended September 30, 2016 was $3,518,828.  
     
  The Company is not relying on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities to realize the deferred tax assets. The same variable used by the Company in evaluating goodwill for impairment was used in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets (See Note 7).    

16

The Company further considered the following positive and negative evidence:  
     
   Positive Evidence   
     
  1) The Company acquired LiqTech Systems AS on July 2014. LiqTech Systems designs water treatment system for pool filtration around the silicon carbide manufactured by LiqTech International AS. Synergies realized by the acquisition include accelerating the change of business strategy to manufacture and offer full water treatment systems.  
     
  2) The Company expects significant growth in the marine waste water industries.   
     
  3) In September 2016, the Company executed a Diesel Particular Filtration supplier contract in China.  
     
  4) For Danish tax purposes the Company is able to obtain tax refunds for research and development expenditures.  
     
   Negative Evidence    
     
  1) The Company has noted a longer than anticipated sales cycle from proposals to signing filtration systems orders.  
     
  2) The Company has a net loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  3) The Company has a net loss from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The temporary differences, tax credits and carry forwards gave rise to the following deferred tax asset (liabilities) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      

A reconciliation of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to income tax expense at the Company s effective rate is as follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

17

The components of income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:  

Deferred income tax expense / (benefit) results primarily from the reversal of temporary timing differences between tax and financial statement income.   
      
  The Company files Danish, U.S. federal and Minnesota state income tax returns. LiqTech International AS is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2010 for their Danish tax returns. LiqTech NA is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2012 for U.S. federal and U.S. states tax returns.

Kailong will invest a minimum of $2.5 million in LiqTech, condition on Chinese government approval. In the event that government approval is not obtained, the letter of intent will terminate. In addition, the letter of intent is conditional on execution of definitive agreements. On October 6, 2016, we announced that due to regulatory issues it has not been possible for Kailong to meet the September 30, 2016 deadline for an investment in LiqTech. The parties have therefore agreed to amend the agreement, so that the joint venture is increasing the payment to the Company for the technology of producing Silicon Carbide Filters.  
     
  On September 7, 2016, we     announced that the Company has entered into a non-binding letter of intent to supply a $1.8 million filtration system for a 100,000 tons per year bioethanol plant to be located in Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. The letter of intent is subject to execution of definitive documents and financing of the project from a Chinese Investment bank.  
     
  On September 27, 2016, we     announced that the Company has received an order for silicon carbide diesel particulate filters from Kailong for $2,360,000 as part of the framework agreement made between the parties earlier this year.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
     
    Revenues     
     
  Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,689,511 compared to $6,933,197 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of 3,243,686 or 46.8%. The decrease in sales consisted of a decrease in sales of DPFs of $527,691 and a decrease in sales of liquid filters and systems of $2,835,470 and an increase in sales of kiln furniture of $119,475. The decrease in demand for our DPFs is mainly due to a decrease in market activity in general compared to the same period last year. The decrease in demand for our liquid filters and systems is mainly due to a decrease in market activity in general compared to the same period last year. The increase in demand for our kiln furniture is due to an increase in market activity compared to the same period last year. We have decided not to focus on this product line anymore and expect very limited activity if any in 2017 and forward  .

Gross Profit    
     
  Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $386,469 compared to a gross profit of $2,314,594 for same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $1,928,125 or 83.3%. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower sales activity compared to the same period in 2015. Included in gross profit is depreciation of $325,990 and $364,230 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
    Expenses    
     
  Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,285,044 representing a decrease of $294,920 or 18.7%, compared to $1,579,964 for the same period in 2015. This decrease in operating expenses is attributable to a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $88,164, or 13.6%, a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $157,732, or 24..0%, a decrease in non-cash compensation expenses of $2,032, or 1.9% and a decrease in research and development expenses of $46,992, or 27.5%, compared to the same period in 2015.      
     
  Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $558,105 compared to $646,269 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $88,164, or 13.6%. This decrease is attributable to a cost reduction in selling expenses in general and a centralization of the sales structure compared to the same period in 2015  .  
     
  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $498,358 compared to $656,090 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $157,732, or 24.0%. This decrease is attributable to a general cost reduction in general expenses.  
     
  Non-cash compensation expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $104,416 compared to $106,448 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $2,032, or 1.9%. This decrease is attributable to decreased non-cash compensation expense for options, shares and warrants for services performed granted to directors, employees and management.  
       
  The following is a summary of our non-cash compensation:   

Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $124,165 compared to $171,157 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $46,992, or 27.5%. This decrease is attributable to a cost reduction in research and development expenditures in general for the three months ending September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
     
    Net Income Attributable to the Company    
     
  Net loss attributable to the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $937,628 compared to a profit of $621,438 for the comparable period in 2015, representing a decrease of $  1,559,066, or 250.9%. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales, lower gross profit and partly offset by lower total operating expenses.   
     
    Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
     
    Revenues    
         
  Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $11,338,817 compared to $10,738,753 for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $600,064, or 5.6%. The increase in sales consisted of an increase in sales of DPFs of $133,967 and an increase in sales of liquid filters and systems of $521,174 and a decrease in sales of kiln furniture of $55,077. The increase in demand for our DPFs is mainly due to an increase in market activity in general compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in demand for our liquid filters and systems was a result of increased order inflow that is now starting to materialize into revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in demand for our kiln furniture is due to our decision not to focus on this product line anymore.  

25

Gross Profit    
         
  Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,260,781 compared to a profit of $1,709,186 for same period in 2015, representing an increase of $551,595, or 32.3%. The increase in gross profit was due to higher sales activity and improved gross margin compared to the same period in 2015. Included in the gross profit is depreciation of $995,687 and $1,055,555 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
    Expenses    
  Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,345,486 representing a decrease of $694,644, or 13.8% compared to $5,040,130 for the same period in 2015. This decrease in operating expenses is attributable to a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $422,852, or 20.3%, a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $324,958, or 15.1%, an increase in non-cash compensation expenses of $113,046, or 42.8% and a decrease in research and development expenses of $59,880, or 11.2% compared to the same period in 2015.  
     
  Selling expenses for the nine months September 30, 2016 were $1,661,352 compared to $2,084,204 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $422,852, or 20.3%. This decrease is attributable to a cost reduction in selling expenses in general and a centralization of our sales structure compared to the same period in 2015.  
       
  General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,830,260 compared to $2,155,218 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $324,958, or 15.1%. This decrease is attributable to a general cost reduction in general expenses.  
     
  Non-cash compensation expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $377,140 compared to $264,094 for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $113,046, or 42.8%. This increase is attributable to increased non-cash compensation expense for options, shares and warrants for services performed granted to directors, employees and management.  
     
  The following is a summary of our non-cash compensation:   

Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $476,734 compared to $536,614 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $59,880, or 11.2%. This decrease is attributable to a cost reduction in research and development expenditures in general for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
     
  In the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company established a valuation allowance of $3.0 million for the tax-paying entities of LiqTech International Inc., LiqTech NA, LiqTech Singapore and LiqTech Germany. As a part of our revised business strategy, the Company is producing and invoicing all membranes and systems from our Danish operations. As North American sales of DPF products continue to decrease, management has determined that it is unlikely that sufficient DPF sales income would be generated in North America to realize the resulting net operating loss carry forwards.  
         
    Net Loss Attributable to the Company    
     
  Net income attributable to the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $5,020,699 compared to a loss of $2,343,881 for the comparable period in 2015, representing an increase in loss of $2,676,818, or 114.2%. This increase in loss was primarily attributable to an increase in income tax expense of 3,734,358. This was partly offset by an increase in sales, higher gross profit and lower total operating expenses.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  We have historically satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements through offerings of equity instruments, internally generated cash from operations and our available lines of credit. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any available lines of credit with any lender. At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $237,683 and working capital of $6,963,217 and at December 31, 2015, we had cash and restricted cash of $1,663,417 and working capital of $7,642,314. At September 30, 2016, our working capital decreased by $679,097 compared to December 31, 2015. Total current assets were $11,497,267 and $12,983,004 at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015, respectively, and total current liabilities were $4,534,050 and $5,340,690 at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015, respectively.  

26

In connection with certain orders, we have to give the customer a working guarantee or a prepayment guarantee or security bond. For that purpose, we previously had a guarantee credit line of DKK 473,100 (approximately $70,900 at September 30, 2016) with a bank, subject to certain base limitations. As of September 30, 2016, we had DKK473,100 (approximately $70,900) in working guarantee against the line. This line of credit is guaranteed by V kstfonden (the Danish state's investments fund) and is secured by certain assets of LiqTech Systems such as receivables, inventory and equipment.   
      
  We believe that our cash flow and other potential sources of funds, including cash raised from the sale of common stock of the Company, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital requirements for the next twelve months.  However, if we were to incur any unanticipated expenditures, including an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts or the negative trend of our operating cash flow continues, this could have a negative effect on our operations and put a substantial burden on our cash resources.  
     
  We may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or debt securities. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business.  
       
  The Company is actively pursuing to raise up to an additional $7,500,000 in cash through the sales of Common stock of the Company in a private placement.  The Company has met with several potential investors and anticipates securing additional equity financing.  
   
    Cash Flows  
     
    Nine months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015    
     
  Cash provided (used) by operating activities is net income (losses) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,102,679, representing a decrease of $831,938 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1,934,617 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $831,938 decrease in cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly due to an increase of $3,193,214 in deferred tax asset / liability, an increase of $1,271,781 in long-term contracts and a decrease of $292,826 in   restricted cash. This was partially offset by a net loss of $5,020,699, an increase of $1,026,055 in   accounts receivable, an increase of $572,709 in inventory and a decrease of $649,056 in accounts payable.  
     
  The increase in deferred tax asset / liability, increase in long-term contracts, increase of in inventory, increase in accounts receivable and the decrease in accounts payable were all due to normal variations in the ordinary course of business.  
     
  Cash used in investing activities was $129,411 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $409,093 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $279,682 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was due to a period over period decrease of $279,682 in the purchase of property.  
     
  Cash used by financing activities was $133,776 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used by financing activities of $176,153 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change of $42,377 in cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 2015, was mainly due to a decrease in payments proceeds on capital lease obligations offset by   payments from loans payable.  
     
   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases. We are not aware of any material transactions, which are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.   
     
   Operating Leases   
       
  The Company leases office and production facilities under operating lease agreements expiring in August 2018, May 2018, February 2017, June 2017 and December 2016. In some of these lease agreements, the Company has the right to extend.  
     
  The future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates   
     
  There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.   
     
   Recently Enacted Accounting Standards   
     
  For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see  Note 1: Recently Enacted Accounting Standards  in the accompanying Financial Statements.  
     
   Subsequent Events   
     
  On November 8, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Hunan Yonker Water Co., Ltd. ( HYW ), pursuant to which the Company and HYW agreed to set up a joint venture company in China relating to filtration systems based on the Company s Silicon Carbide Membrane technology used in water and wastewater treatment for industrial municipal facilities.  Furthermore, on November 8, 2016, the Company and Hunan Yonker Investment Group Co., Ltd ( Hunan Yonker ) entered into an agreement pursuant to which Hunan Yonker agreed to purchase 4,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company at $1.00 per share (the  Shares ). The closing of the purchase of the shares is subject to receipt of all US and China government approvals. Such approvals are expected to be received by February 28th, 2017.  
   
   ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
     
  Not applicable.   
     
   ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
   (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  Our management, under supervision and with the participation of both of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, both of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   
     
  We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.   
     
   (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1.   
 
  I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 of Liqtech International, Inc.;    

2. 
 Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  

3. 
 Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  

4. 
 I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   
     
  (a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
     
  (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
     
  (c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
     
  (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  

5.   
 
  The registrant s other certifying officer (s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):     
     
  (a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
     
  (b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
