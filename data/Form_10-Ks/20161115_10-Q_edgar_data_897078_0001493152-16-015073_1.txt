These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America for interim financial information and the SEC instructions to Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the interim period ended September 30,

NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read
in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s most recent Annual Financial
Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been
reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited
financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.  

Going
concern   

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to
a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,749,998. The company s ability
to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability
to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While the Company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there
is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Cash

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

The
Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial
institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. At September 30, 2016 no cash balances exceeded the federally
insured limit.  

Accounts
receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts    

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect. The Company generally does not require collateral to support
customer receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts
receivable, historical collection information and existing economic conditions. As of September 30, 2016   2015 the allowance
for doubtful accounts was $0 and bad debt expense of $0 and $0, respectively.  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ( ASC ), 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize
revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service
has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection
of our fees is reasonably assured.  

Thus,
we recognize subscription revenue on a monthly basis, as services are provided. Customers are billed for the subscription on a
monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, at the customer s option.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the respective fair
values due to the short maturities of these items.  

As
required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly
or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions.  

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  

Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;  

Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that is observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability;  

Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).  

The
fair value of the accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their
value is considered fair value.  

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below for the nine months ended September 30,
2016:  

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below for the year ended December 31, 2015:

following table presents details of the Company s level 3 derivative liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,

Net
income (loss) per Common Share   

Basic
net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss
per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation  
Stock Compensation which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation
expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.  

The
Company follows ASC Topic 505-50, formerly EITF 96-18,  Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services,  for stock options and warrants issued to consultants
and other non-employees. In accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services
provided to the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value
of the option or warrant, whichever can be more clearly determined. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly
to compensation expense and additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.  

Investments
in Securities    

Investments
in securities are accounted for using the equity method if the investment provides the Company the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership
interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee s
Board of Directors, are considered in determining whether the equity method is appropriate.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

No
new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the
financial statements.  

NOTE
4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has advances due to a related party. The loans are due on demand and have no interest. Amounts
outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were approximately $11,750 and $11,750, respectively.

Litigations,
Claims and Assessments   

The
Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.  

Included
in this litigation is a dispute over a $36,363 note secured by 59,400,000 shares of the Company s common stock. In the view
of management, there are significant issues of fact regarding the proper issuance and assumption of this note by the Company.
Additionally, there are issues over the validity of the prior debt. Regardless, the Company is in discussions to settle this note,
and while no guarantee can be given as to the successful resolution of this matter, the Company believes it will be resolved without
litigation.  

However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise that may harm its business.
The Company is currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that they believe will have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.

July 7, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to settle the note and accrued interest for 2,000,000 shares  of common
stock valued at $146,000. (See Note 6).

Forward-Looking
Statements   

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking
statements.  These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believes,   project, 
 expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends,   strategy,   plan, 
 may,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely

subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our
ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have
a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes
in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted
accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue
reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Results
of Operation for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenues

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we earned revenues in the amount of $129,943, as compared with revenues of $80,289
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we earned revenues in the amount
of $321,802, as compared with revenues of $236,912 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
increase in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the prior year periods is due to more customer
accounts achieved from a change in our pricing model to become more competitive. We expect to achieve greater revenues for the
rest of 2016 and into 2017.  

Cost
of Revenues     

Cost
of revenues was $13,560 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $73,494 for the same period ended September
30, 2015. Cost of revenues was $64,079 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $101,190 for the same period
ended September 30, 2015.  

Our
cost of revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same periods ended September
30, 2015 and was mainly attributable to a lack of costs associated with SMS messaging, offset by an increase in web hosting costs.
We expect to continue paying similar web hosting costs and perhaps more as traffic to our website increases.  

Operating
Expenses     

Our
operating expenses were $619,698 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $116,299 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Our operating expenses were $997,476 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with
$3,069,358 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Our
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly consisted of consulting expenses of $451,755, contract
labor of $111,122, management compensation of $81,846, directors fees of $51,500, legal fees of $50,907, accounting fees of 49,598
and professional fees of $39,305. Our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  mainly consisted of
consulting fees of $2,772,805. Absent this expense, a comparison of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 shows across the board increases in every major category. This is attributable to increased operations. We expect
similar results in future quarters as we continue to grow our business.  

Other
Expenses     

We
had other expenses of $534,174 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $814,245 for the same period ended
September 30, 2015. We had other expenses of $1,845,359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1,009,577
for the same period ended September 30, 2015.  

Other
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $1,046,435 due to the loss on change of derivative liabilities,
$423,313 in amortization of debt discount, $242,016 for the loss on the settlement of notes payable and $133,595 in interest expenses.
Other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of $830,750 due to the loss on change of derivative liabilities,
$143,487 in amortization of debt discount and $35,340 in interest expenses.  

All
referenced categories were increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period ended 2015.  

Net
Loss     

We
had a net loss of $1,037,560 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net loss of $923,749 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. We had a net loss of $2,572,904 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with
net loss of $3,943,213 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $112,529, consisting mostly of cash and prepaid expenses. Our total current
liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $1,363,725. We had a working capital deficit of $1,251,196 as of September 30, 2016.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities     

Operating
activities used $347,484  in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $258,012 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Our net loss of $2,572,904 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, offset mainly by the loss on derivative liabilities of $1,046,435, amortization of debt discount of
$423,313 and prepaid expenses of $32,811.  Our net loss of $3,943,213 and accounts payable and accrued expenses of $37,627
were the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, offset mainly by share
based compensation of $2,748,000 the loss on derivative liabilities of $830,750 and amortization of debt discount of $143,487.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities    

Investing
activities provided $24,335 in cash the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $0 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Our positive investing cash flow was entirely attributable to cash we received in distributions from Aspire.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities    

Cash
flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $337,980 , compared with
$260,382 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted mostly
of proceeds from the sale of convertible promissory notes, offset by payments on loans payable and payments on convertible notes
payable. Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted mostly of proceeds from the sale of convertible
promissory notes and loans payable, offset by payments on loans payable and payments on convertible notes payable.  

On
July 18, 2016, we entered a convertible promissory note pursuant to which we borrowed $237,750 including a debt discount of $20,000.
Interest under the convertible promissory note is 10% per annum, and the principal and all accrued but unpaid interest is due
on April 18, 2017. The note is convertible at any date after the issuance date at noteholders option into shares of our common
stock at a variable conversion price of 55% of the lowest day market price of our common stock during the previous 25 days immediately
preceding the conversion date.  

On
August 22, 2016, we entered into an agreement to settle certain convertible notes payable issued on September, 10, 2013, September
27, 2013, November 7, 2013, and November 17, 2013 with balances of $90,762, including interest for $33,000. Upon the settlement
of the notes, we recorded a $57,762 gain related to the difference between the note balances and the settlement price.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 35,359,380 shares of common stock with a fair value of $526,852  for
the partial conversion of convertible notes payable. The converted portion of the notes also had associated derivative liabilities
with fair values on the date of conversion of $1,405,616. The conversion of the derivative liabilities has been recorded through
additional paid-in capital.  

Subsequent
to quarter end, we issued 35,307,536 shares of common stock valued at $32,515 in settlement of certain convertible note payable
and accrued interest issued on July 10, 2015.  

Our
optimum level of growth for success will be achieved if we are able to raise $250,000 in the next twelve months. However, funds
are difficult to raise in today s economic environment. If we are unable to raise $250,000 our ability to implement our
business plan and achieve our goals will be significantly diminished.  

We
have experienced a history of losses. With our revenues increasing, however, we are less reliant on outside capital as we have
been in the past. We will need at a minimum $120,000 in capital to operate in the next 12 months.  

We
are dependent on investment capital to continue our survival. We have raised money through convertible debt, almost always on
unfavorable terms. There is no guarantee that these small convertible loans will be available to us in the future or on terms
acceptable to us.  

We
do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sales of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There
can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.  

Going
Concern    

As
of September 30, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of $6,749,998. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent
upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.
While we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate
funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

As
of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of our audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

No
new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the
financial statements.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

We
conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified and described below.  

Our
principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.
Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of
the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual
a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.  

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following three material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude
that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, were
not effective at the reasonable assurance level:  

1.  
      We
    do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
    over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the period ending September 30, 2016.
    Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our
    assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented
    a material weakness.   

2.  
      We
    do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size
    and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However,
    to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be
    performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment
    of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material
    weakness.   

3.  
      Effective
    controls over the control environment were not maintained. Specifically, a formally adopted written code of business conduct
    and ethics that governs our employees, officers, and directors was not in place. Additionally, management has not developed
    and effectively communicated to employees its accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices.
    Further, our Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee
    financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect
    across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.   

To
address these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial
statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all
material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

To
remediate the material weakness in our documentation, evaluation and testing of internal controls we plan to engage a third-party
firm to assist us in remedying this material weakness once resources become available.  

We
intend to remedy our material weakness with regard to insufficient segregation of duties by hiring additional employees in order
to segregate duties in a manner that establishes effective internal controls once resources become available.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the period
ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
