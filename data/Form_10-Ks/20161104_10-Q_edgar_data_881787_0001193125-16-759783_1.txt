  PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION       
 Item 1. Financial Statements.     The condensed financial statements included herein are presented, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the trustee believes
that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Trust s latest Annual
Report on Form  10-K.  In the opinion of the trustee, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Cross
Timbers Royalty Trust at September 30, 2016, and the distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been included. Distributable income for such interim
periods is not necessarily indicative of distributable income for the full year. The condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been
subjected to a review by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm, whose report is included herein.

     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 To the Unitholders of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust and    Southwest
Bank, Trustee:    We have reviewed the accompanying condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust (the
 Trust ) as of September 30, 2016, and the related condensed statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim financial
statements are the responsibility of the Trustee.    We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion.    As described in Note 1, these financial statements were prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive
basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    Based on our review, we are not aware of any
material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 1.  
 We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of assets, liabilities
and trust corpus as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated March 11, 2016, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus as of December 31, 2015 is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to
the statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus from which it has been derived.    /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

   CROSS TIMBERS ROYALTY TRUST   
        Notes to Condensed
Financial Statements  (Unaudited)        

1.  
  Basis of Accounting       The financial statements of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust are
prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ):  

- 
 Net profits income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by XTO Energy Inc., the owner of the underlying properties, to Southwest Bank, as trustee for the Trust. XTO Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Exxon Mobil Corporation. Net profits income consists of net proceeds received by XTO Energy from the underlying properties in the prior month, multiplied by net profit percentages of 90% for the 90% net profits interests, and 75% for the 75% net
profits interests.      Costs deducted in the calculation of net proceeds for the 90% net profits interests generally include
applicable taxes, transportation, marketing and legal costs, and do not include production expense or development costs. For the 75% net profits interests, costs deducted in the calculation of net proceeds include production expense, development
costs, applicable taxes, transportation, marketing and legal costs, operating charges and other costs.      

- 
 Net profits income is computed separately for each of five conveyances under which the net profits interests were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess costs must be
recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from the other conveyances.        

- 
 Interest income, interest to be received and distribution payable to unitholders include interest to be earned on net profits income from the monthly record date (last business day of the month) through the date of the
next distribution to unitholders.        

- 
 Trust expenses are recorded based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established by the trustee for liabilities and contingencies.    

- 
 Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the trustee.        

- 
 The trustee reviews the Trust s net profits interests ( NPI ) in oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the NPI may not be recoverable.
In general, the trustee does not view temporarily low prices as a trigger event for conducting an impairment test. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and though prices will occasionally drop
significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. If a trigger event occurred, the trustee would use the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the NPI to evaluate the recoverability
of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted future net cash flows from the NPI are less than the NPI carrying value, the Trust would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the NPI carrying value and the estimated fair value of the NPI.
The determination as to whether the NPI is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by the trustee and is based on the best information available to the trustee at the time of the evaluation. There was no impairment of the assets as of
September 30, 2016.    
      9

  The financial statements of the Trust differ from those prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP
because revenues are recognized when received rather than accrued in the month of production, expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred, and certain cash reserves may be established by the trustee for contingencies which would not
be recorded under U.S. GAAP. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,
Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.    Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the Trust s financial statements are prepared on the modified
cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust s financial statements.    The initial
carrying value of the net profits interests of $61,100,449 represents XTO Energy s historical net book value for the interests on February 12, 1991, the creation date of the Trust. Amortization of the net profits interests is calculated on
a  unit-of-production  basis and is charged directly to trust corpus. Accumulated amortization was $51,032,872 as of September 30, 2016 and $50,558,213 as of December 31, 2015.  

2.  
  Income Taxes       For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed investment
trust that is taxed as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made in the financial statements. The unitholders are considered to own the Trust s income and
principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust and not when distributed by the Trust.  
 All revenues from the Trust are from sources within Texas, Oklahoma or New Mexico. Because it distributes all of its net income to unitholders,
the Trust has not been taxed at the Trust level in New Mexico or Oklahoma. While the Trust has not owed tax, the trustee is required to file a return with Oklahoma reflecting the income and deductions of the Trust attributable to properties located
in that state, along with a schedule that includes information regarding distributions to unitholders. Texas does not impose a state income tax, so no part of the Trust s income will be subject to income tax at the trust level in Texas.  
 Each unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding income tax requirements, if any, applicable to such person s ownership
of Trust units.    Unitholders should consult the Trust s latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of federal and
state tax matters.      

3.  
  Contingencies       Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax
withholding from nonresident recipients of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its tax counsel, the trustee believes that it is not required to withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the
various states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments made to the Trust or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the filing of a claim for refund by
the Trust or unitholders for such amount.

4.  
  Excess Costs         
   If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued
interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from other conveyances.    XTO Energy advised the
trustee that continued lower oil prices resulted in net excess costs of $23,597 ($17,698 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, $163,954 ($122,966 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and $392,377
($294,283 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 on properties underlying the Texas working interest.    XTO Energy
advised the trustee that improved oil prices and decreased costs resulted in the partial recovery of excess costs of $316,303 ($237,227 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and $63,820 ($47,865 net to the Trust) for the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices resulted in net excess costs of $115,984 ($86,988 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31,
2016 on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest.    XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices and increased costs
caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $108,730 ($81,548 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Texas working interest for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that decreased costs in August 2015
led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $20,126 ($15,095 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $310,588 ($232,941
net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Texas working interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices and increased costs caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $410,337 ($307,753
net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Texas working interest for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.    XTO Energy advised the
trustee that a missing payment from a purchaser, lower oil prices and decreased oil production caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $155,439 ($116,579 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased oil production and decreased costs in August 2015 led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $145,804 ($109,353 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended
September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices, decreased oil production and increased costs caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $807,158 ($605,369 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma
working interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Lower oil prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $43,414 ($32,560 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest for the quarter ended March 31,
2015.

  Cumulative excess costs for the Texas and Oklahoma working interest conveyances remaining as of
September 30, 2016 totaled $2,341,860 ($1,756,395 net to the Trust).       Item 2. Trustee s Discussion and
Analysis.     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trustee s discussion and analysis contained in the Trust s 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the condensed financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
 10-Q,  current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available on the Trust s web site at  www.crt-crosstimbers.com .  
  Distributable Income      Quarter   
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, net profits income was $1,513,537 compared to $1,894,473 for third quarter 2015. This 20% decrease in net
profits income is primarily the result of lower oil and gas prices ($0.8 million) and net excess costs in 2015 ($0.3 million), partially offset by decreased production expenses ($0.4 million) and decreased development costs ($0.3 million). See
 Net Profits Income  below.    After considering interest income of $356, administration expense of $88,981 and additions to the cash reserve of
$125,000, distributable income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $1,299,912, or $0.216652 per unit of beneficial interest. Administration expense for the quarter decreased $44,836 from the prior year quarter. For third quarter 2015,
distributable income was $1,760,664, or $0.293444 per unit.    Distributions to unitholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were:  
   
    Nine Months     For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, net profits income was $5,610,716 compared to $6,570,157 for the same 2015 period. This 15% decrease in net profits income is primarily the result of lower oil and gas prices ($2.8 million) and net excess costs
in 2015 ($1.0 million), partially offset by lower development costs ($1.2 million), decreased production expenses ($1.0 million) and increased gas production ($0.7 million). See  Net Profits Income  below.  
 After considering interest income of $597, administration expense of $430,239 and additions to the cash reserve of $725,000, distributable income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,456,074, or $0.742679 per unit of beneficial interest. Administration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $48,333 from the prior year nine-month period. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, distributable income was $6,063,282, or $1.010547 per unit.

Table of Contents  

   Net Profits Income   
 Net profits income is recorded when received by the Trust, which is the month following receipt by XTO Energy and generally two months after oil production and
three months after gas production. Net profits income is generally affected by three major factors:      

oil and gas sales volumes,        

oil and gas sales prices, and        

costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income.      Because properties underlying the 90% net profits
interests are royalty and overriding royalty interests, the calculation of net profits income from these interests only includes deductions for production and property taxes, legal costs, and marketing and transportation charges. In addition to
these costs, the calculation of net profits income from the 75% net profits interests includes deductions for production expense and development costs since the related underlying properties are working interests.  
      13  

Table of Contents  

  The following is a summary of the calculation of net profits income received by the Trust:  

(a)  
   Because of the interval between time of production and receipt of royalty income by the Trust, (1) oil and gas sales for the quarter ended September 30 generally represent oil production for the period
May through July and gas production for the period April through June and (2) oil and gas sales for the nine-months ended September 30 generally represent oil production for the period November through July and gas production for the
period October through June.        

(b)  
   Oil and gas sales volumes are allocated to the net profits interests based upon a formula that considers oil and gas prices and the total amount of production expense and development costs. As product prices
change, the Trust s share of the production volumes is impacted as the quantity of production to cover expenses in reaching the net profits break-even level changes inversely with price. As such, the underlying property production volume
changes may not correlate with the Trust s net profit share of those volumes in any given period. Therefore, comparative discussion of oil and gas sales volumes is based on the underlying properties.    

(c)  
   Production expense is primarily from seven working interest properties in the 75% net profits interest. Six of these properties are not operated by XTO Energy or ExxonMobil. Production expense includes an
overhead charge which is deducted and retained by the operator. As of September 30, 2016, this charge was $37,200 per month (including a monthly overhead charge of $5,314 which XTO Energy deducts as operator of the Hewitt Unit) and is subject
to adjustment each May based on an oil and gas industry index.

  The following are explanations of significant variances on the underlying properties from third quarter 2015 to
third quarter 2016 and from the first nine months of 2015 to the comparable period in 2016:     Sales Volumes   
  Oil     Oil sales volumes decreased 4% for third quarter and
2% for the first nine months of 2016 primarily because of natural production decline, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts.     Gas   
 Gas sales volumes were relatively flat for third quarter 2016 as natural production decline was offset by the timing of cash receipts. Gas sales volumes
increased 39% for the first nine months of 2016 primarily because of the timing of cash receipts related to purchaser payments covering production back to 2013, partially offset by natural production decline.  
 The estimated rate of natural production decline on the underlying oil and gas properties is approximately 6% to 8% a year.  
  Sales Prices      Oil   
 The average oil price decreased 22% to $42.06 per Bbl for the third quarter and decreased 34% to $36.73 per Bbl for the nine-month period. Oil prices are
expected to remain volatile. The third quarter 2016 oil price is primarily related to production from May through July 2016, when the average NYMEX price was $46.89 per Bbl. The average NYMEX price for August and September 2016 was $45.00 per Bbl.
At October 19, 2016, the average NYMEX futures price for the following twelve months was $53.05 per Bbl.     Gas   
 Gas prices for the third quarter decreased 12% to $3.37 per Mcf and for the nine-month period decreased 20% to $3.58 per Mcf. Excluding the impact of the prior
period production payments received in third quarter 2016 and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 the adjusted gas price was $2.82 and $2.83 respectively. Natural gas prices are affected by natural gas liquids prices, the level of North
American production, weather, crude oil prices, the U.S. economy, storage levels and import levels of liquefied natural gas. Natural gas prices are expected to remain volatile. The third quarter 2016 gas price is primarily related to production from
April through June 2016, when the average NYMEX price was $1.95 per MMBtu. The average NYMEX price for July through September 2016 was $2.81 per MMBtu. At October 19, 2016, the average NYMEX futures price for the following twelve months was
$3.37 per MMBtu.     Costs      Taxes, Transportation and
Other     Taxes, transportation and other costs decreased 19% for the third quarter and 11% for the nine-month period primarily because of lower oil and
gas production taxes related to lower oil and gas revenues and decreased property taxes related to lower valuations, partially offset by increased other deductions as a percentage of oil and gas revenues.

   Production Expense   
 Production expense decreased 32% for the third quarter and 29% for the nine-month period primarily because of decreased outside operated and repairs and
maintenance costs.     Development Costs     Development
costs decreased 63% for the third quarter and 67% for the nine-month period primarily because of decreased activity and costs related to non-operated Texas and Oklahoma oil properties underlying the 75% net profits interest.  
  Excess Costs     If monthly costs exceed revenues for any
conveyance, such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from other conveyances.  
 XTO Energy advised the trustee that continued lower oil prices resulted in net excess costs of $23,597 ($17,698 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, $163,954 ($122,966 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and $392,377 ($294,283 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 on properties underlying the Texas working interest.  
 XTO Energy advised the trustee that improved oil prices and decreased costs resulted in the partial recovery of excess costs of $316,303 ($237,227 net to the
Trust) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and $63,820 ($47,865 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices
resulted in net excess costs of $115,984 ($86,988 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest.  
 XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices and increased costs caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $108,730 ($81,548 net to the Trust) on
properties underlying the Texas working interest for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that decreased costs in August 2015 led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $20,126 ($15,095 net to the Trust) for
the quarter ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $310,588 ($232,941 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Texas working interest for the quarter
ended June 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices and increased costs caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $410,337 ($307,753 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Texas working interest for the quarter
ended March 31, 2015.    XTO Energy advised the trustee that a missing payment from a purchaser, lower oil prices and decreased oil production caused
costs to exceed revenues by a total of $155,439 ($116,579 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased oil production and
decreased costs in August 2015 led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $145,804 ($109,353 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower oil prices, decreased oil production and
increased costs caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $807,158 ($605,369 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Lower oil prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a
total of $43,414 ($32,560 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.

  Cumulative excess costs for the Texas and Oklahoma working interest conveyances remaining as of
September 30, 2016 totaled $2,341,860 ($1,756,395 net to the Trust).     Contingencies   
 Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax withholding from nonresident recipients of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its
tax counsel, the trustee believes that it is not required to withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the various states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments
made to the Trust or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the filing of a claim for refund by the Trust or unitholders for such amount.  
  Forward-Looking Statements     Statements in this report

     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   
 There have been no material changes in the Trust s market risks from the information disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Trust s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the trustee concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a
timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the trustee to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the trustee has
relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by XTO Energy. There has not been any change in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
