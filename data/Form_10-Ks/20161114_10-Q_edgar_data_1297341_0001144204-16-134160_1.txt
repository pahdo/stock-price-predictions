The Kentucky First Federal Bancorp ( Kentucky
First  or the  Company ) was incorporated under federal law in March 2005, and is the mid-tier holding company
for First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard, Hazard, Kentucky ( First Federal of Hazard ) and Frankfort
First Bancorp, Inc. ( Frankfort First ). Frankfort First is the holding company for First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky,
Frankfort, Kentucky ( First Federal of Kentucky ). First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky (hereinafter
collectively the  Banks ) are Kentucky First s primary operations, which consist of operating the Banks as two
independent, community-oriented savings institutions. 

In December 2012, the Company acquired
CKF Bancorp, Inc., a savings and loan holding company which operated three banking locations in Boyle and Garrard Counties in Kentucky.
In accounting for the transaction the assets and liabilities of CKF Bancorp were recorded on the books of First Federal of Kentucky
in accordance with accounting standard ASC 805, Business Combinations. 

1.  Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which represent the consolidated balance sheets and results of operations of the Company, were prepared in
accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete
presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which are
necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for an entire
fiscal year. The consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet as
of that date. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form
10-K annual report for 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Principles of Consolidation  
- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Frankfort First, and its wholly-owned banking subsidiaries,
First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications   - Certain amounts
presented in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no
impact on prior years  net income or shareholders  equity.

2.  Earnings Per Share  

Diluted earnings per share is computed
taking into consideration common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares to be issued or released under the Company s
share-based compensation plans. The factors used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations follow: 

There were no stock option shares
outstanding for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and 309,800 stock option shares outstanding for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2015. The stock option shares outstanding were antidilutive for the prior year period.

3.   Investment Securities  (continued) 

The Company s equity securities consist
of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company (FHLMC or Freddie Mac) stock, while our debt securities consist of agency bonds and mortgage-backed
securities. Mortgage-backed securities do not have a single maturity date. The amortized cost and fair value of held-to-maturity
debt securities are shown by contractual maturity. Securities not due at a single maturity date are shown separately. 

Our pledged securities totaled $1.2 and
$1.7 million at September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively. The Company had $1.0 million and $500,000 in time deposits
in other financial institutions pledged at September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively. 

There were no sales of investment securities
during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We evaluated securities in unrealized loss
positions for evidence of other-than-temporary impairment, considering duration, severity, financial condition of the issuer, our
intention to sell or requirement to sell. Those securities were agency bonds, which carry a very limited amount of risk. Also,
we have no intention to sell nor feel that we will be compelled to sell such securities before maturity. Based on our evaluation,
no impairment has been recognized through earnings.

Troubled Debt Restructurings:  

A Troubled Debt Restructuring ( TDR )
is the situation where the Bank grants a concession to the borrower that the Bank would not otherwise have considered due to the
borrower s financial difficulties. All TDRs are considered  impaired.  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
the Company had $1.8 million of loans classified as TDRs. Of the TDRs at September 30, 2016, approximately 26.5% were related to
the borrowers  completion of Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings with no reaffirmation of the debt to the Banks.

Credit Quality Indicators:  

The Company categorizes loans
into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial
information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other
factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on an annual
basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Special Mention.  Loans
classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected,
these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit
position at some future date. 

Substandard.  Loans classified
as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged,
if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized
by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful.  Loans classified
as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses
make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and
improbable. 

Loans not meeting the criteria
above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed
that are not rated are included in groups of homogeneous loans and are evaluated for credit quality based on performing status.
See the aging of past due loan table above. As of September 30, 2016, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk
category of loans by class of loans is as follows:

Purchased Credit Impaired
Loans:  

The Company purchased loans
during fiscal year 2013 for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and
it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. The carrying amount of those
loans, net of a purchase credit discount of $449,000 and $464,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, is as
follows:

Accretable yield, or income expected to be collected,
is as follows 

For those purchased loans disclosed above, the Company
made no increase in allowance for loan losses for the year ended June 30, 2016, nor for the three-month period ended September
30, 2016. Neither were any allowance for loan losses reversed during those periods. 

5.   Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities  

ASC topic 820 defines fair value
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. ASC topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1  - Quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2  - Observable
inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in active markets that
are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3    Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

Following is a description of
the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.    

Securities  

Where quoted market prices are
available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are
not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.
Level 2 securities include agency mortgage-backed securities.

5.   Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities (continued)    

Impaired Loans  

At the time a loan is considered
impaired, it is evaluated for loss based on the fair value of collateral securing the loan if the loan is collateral dependent.
If a loss is identified, a specific allocation will be established as part of the allowance for loan losses such that the loan s
net carrying value is at its estimated fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations
of the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals.
These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income
approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between
the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification
of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s
financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market
conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business,
resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and
adjusted accordingly. 

Other Real Estate  

Assets acquired through or instead
of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These
assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based
on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including
comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers
to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and
typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.

fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

Other real estate owned measured
at fair value less costs to sell, had carrying amounts of $302,000 and $353,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.
Other real estate owned was written down $0 and $18,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The following is a disclosure
of the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance
sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. For financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available,
fair values are based on estimates using present value and other valuation methods. 

The methods used are greatly
affected by the assumptions applied, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Therefore, the fair values
presented may not represent amounts that could be realized in an exchange for certain financial instruments.

5.   Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities (continued)  

The following methods were used
to estimate the fair value of all other financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016: 

Cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits : The carrying amounts presented
in the consolidated statements of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents are deemed to approximate fair value.   

Held-to-maturity securities : For held-to-maturity securities, fair value is estimated by
using pricing models, quoted price of securities with similar characteristics, which is level 2 pricing for the other securities.   

Loans held for sale : Loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are
determined by FHLB pricing schedules.   

Loans : The loan portfolio has been segregated into categories with similar characteristics,
such as one- to four-family residential, multi-family residential and nonresidential real estate. These loan categories were further
delineated into fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. The fair values for the resultant loan categories were computed via discounted
cash flow analysis, using current interest rates offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. For
loans on deposit accounts and consumer and other loans, fair values were deemed to equal the historic carrying values. The fair
values of the loans does not necessarily represent an exit price.   

Loans receivable represents the Company s
most significant financial asset, which is in Level 3 for fair value measurements. A third party provides financial modeling for
the Company and results are based on assumptions and factors determined by management. 

Federal Home Loan Bank stock : It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB
stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.   

Accrued interest receivable : The carrying amount is the estimated fair value.                                                                                                                                                                                             

Deposits : The fair value of NOW accounts, passbook accounts, and money market deposits are
deemed to approximate the amount payable on demand. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit have been estimated using
a discounted cash flow calculation using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.   

Federal Home Loan Bank advances :
The fair value of these advances is estimated using the rates currently offered for similar advances of similar remaining maturities
or, when available, quoted market prices. 

Advances by borrowers for taxes
and insurance and accrued interest payable : The carrying amount presented in the consolidated statement of financial condition
is deemed to approximate fair value. 

Commitments to extend credit :
For fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loan commitments, the fair value estimate considers the difference between current levels of
interest rates and committed rates. The fair value of outstanding loan commitments at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, was
not material.

(continued)  

Discussion of Financial Condition
Changes from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016  

Assets:   At September
30, 2016, the Company s assets totaled $295.1 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 1.1%, from total assets at June 30,
2016. This increase was attributed primarily to increases in loans, cash and cash equivalents and time deposits in other financial
institutions. 

Cash and cash equivalents: 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased $538,000 or 4.1% to $13.6 million at September 30, 2016, primarily as we seek to maintain
the appropriate level of liquidity. Our strategy is to balance our need for liquidity to meet day-to-day operational cash flows
against keeping too much idle cash on hand. We keep a minimum of 8.0% of our liquidity base for normal cash flow needs and borrow
short-term using FHLB advances when cash is low. Likewise, we pay down FHLB advances with any excess funds we might have. 

Time Deposits in Other Financial
Institutions:  Time deposits in other financial institutions increased $988,000 or 26.6% to $4.7 million at September 30, 2016,
as we seek to earn a higher interest rate on short-term liquidity. 

Investment securities:  Investment
securities decreased $665,000 or 15.8% to $3.5 million at September 30, 2016, due to maturity of a $500,000 agency bond and cash
flows associated with mortgage-backed securities. 

Loans   : 
Loans receivable, net, increased by $2.8 million or 1.2% to $241.2 million at September 30, 2016. Management continues to look
for high-quality loans to add to its portfolio and will continue to emphasize loan originations to the extent that it is profitable,
prudent and consistent with our interest rate risk strategies. 

Non-Performing and Classified
Loans:    At September 30, 2016, the Company had non-performing loans (loans 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual
status) of approximately $8.7 million, or 3.6% of total loans (including loans purchased in the acquisition), compared to $7.1
million or 2.9%, of total loans at June 30, 2016.  The Company s allowance for loan losses totaled $1.5 million at both
September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016. The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016, represented 16.9% of nonperforming
loans and 0.6% of total loans (including loans purchased in the acquisition), while at June 30, 2016, the allowance represented
21.2% of nonperforming loans and 0.6% of total loans. 

The Company had $12.8 million
in assets classified as substandard for regulatory purposes at September 30, 2016, including loans ($12.5 million) and real estate
owned ( REO ) ($345,000), including loans acquired in the CKF Bancorp transaction. Classified loans as a percentage
of total loans (including loans acquired on December 31, 2012) were 5.1% at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Of substandard
loans at September 30, 2016, 99.8% were secured by real estate on which the Banks have priority lien position.

Discussion of Financial Condition Changes
from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016  (continued) 

The table below shows the aggregate amounts
of our assets classified for regulatory purposes at the dates indicated: 

At September 30, 2016, the Company s
real estate acquired through foreclosure represented 2.7% of substandard assets compared to 4.0% at June 30, 2016. During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold property with carrying value of $239,000 for $357,000, while during the year
ended June 30, 2016, property with a carrying value of $727,000 was sold for $822,000. During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company made a $110,000 loan to facilitate the purchase of its other real estate owned by qualified borrowers, while
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, $741,000 in loans to facilitate an exchange were made. The Company defers recognition
of any gain on loans to facilitate an exchange until the proper time in the future. Loans to facilitate the sale of other real
estate owned, which were included in substandard loans, totaled $372,000 and $375,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
respectively.

Discussion of Financial Condition Changes
from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016  (continued) 

The following table presents the aggregate
carrying value of REO at the dates indicated: 

At September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016,
the Company had $7.1 million and $7.3 million of loans classified as special mention, respectively (including loans purchased at
December 31, 2012.) This category includes assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification,
but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. The primary reason for this decrease
was related to two larger borrowers who each experienced some weakness in cash flow, but had no delinquency and their loans were
well secured by real estate. 

Liabilities:   At September
30, 2016, the Company s liabilities increased $3.3 million, or 1.5%, to $227.6 million compared to total liabilities at June
30, 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in advances, which increased $5.9 million or 17.9% to $39.1 million at September
30, 2016. The increase in advances was used to fund the growth in assets and to partially offset a decrease of $3.1 million or
1.6% in deposits, which totaled $185.5 million at quarter end. Deposit customers continue seeking higher yields on their funds
after growing impatient in the current low-rate environment and some are turning to non-insured investments. As deposits have continued
to decrease, we have utilized short-term FHLB advances as replacement funding. 

Shareholders  Equity:  
At September 30, 2016, the Company s shareholders  equity totaled $67.5 million, a decrease of $28,000 from the June
30, 2016 total. The change in shareholders  equity was chiefly associated with net profits for the period less dividends
paid on common stock.

from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (continued)  

The Company paid dividends of $372,000
or 125.3% of net income for the three month period just ended. On July 7, 2016, the members of First Federal MHC for the fifth
time approved a dividend waiver on annual dividends of up to $0.40 per share of Kentucky First Federal Bancorp common stock. The
Board of Directors of First Federal MHC applied for approval of another waiver. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland has notified
the Company that there would be no objection to a waiver of dividends paid by the Company to First Federal MHC, and, as a result,
First Federal MHC will be permitted to waive the receipt of dividends for quarterly dividends up to $0.10 per common share through
the third quarter of 2017. Management believes that the Company has sufficient capital to continue the current dividend policy
without affecting the well-capitalized status of either subsidiary bank. Management cannot speculate on future dividend levels,
because various factors, including capital levels, income levels, liquidity levels, regulatory requirements and overall financial
condition of the Company are considered before dividends are declared. However, management continues to believe that a strong dividend
is consistent with the Company s long-term capital management strategy. See  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A,
of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 for additional discussion regarding dividends. 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General  

Net income totaled $297,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $241,000 or 44.8% from net income of $538,000 for the same period in 2015. The
net decrease in net earnings for the recently-ended quarter was primarily attributable to lower net interest income, higher non-interest
expense and higher income tax expense. 

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income after provision for
loan losses decreased $166,000 or 6.3% to $2.5 million for the three month period just ended compared to $2.6 million for the prior
year quarter primarily due to reduced interest income. Interest income decreased $195,000 or 6.5% to $2.8 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, while interest expense decreased $22,000 or 6.3% to $328,000 for the quarter just ended after amortization
of fair value adjustments on interest bearing accounts. Provision for losses on loans decreased $7,000 to $4,000 for the recently-ended
quarter compared to a provision of $11,000 in the prior year period. 

Interest income on loans decreased $199,000
or 6.9% to $2.7 million, due primarily to a decrease in the average rate earned on the loan portfolio, which decreased 24 basis
points to 4.46% for the recently ended quarter compared to the prior year period. The average balance of loans outstanding for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, decreased $4.8 million or 2.0% to $241.5 million. Interest income on mortgage-backed
securities and other securities was largely unchanged, while interest-bearing deposits and other increased $4,000 or 6.3% to $68,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, due to higher balances of time deposits in other financial institutions during the
recently-ended quarter.

  AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS   (continued)  

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

 (continued) 

Interest expense on deposits decreased
$33,000 or 11.8% and totaled $247,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, while interest expense on borrowings
increased $11,000 or 15.7% to $81,000 for the most recently ended period. The decrease in interest expense on deposits was attributed
to a decrease in both the average balance of deposits and the average rate paid on deposits. The average balance of deposits decreased
$11.4 million or 5.8% to $183.7 million for the most recent quarter, while the average rate paid on deposits decreased 3 basis
points to 0.54%. The decrease in average deposits was primarily attributed to rate-sensitive deposit customers withdrawing funds
to seek additional yield as the historically low interest rate environment continues. The increase in interest expense on borrowings
also was attributed to higher outstanding balances of FHLB advances, which were used increase total assets and to offset deposit
funding. The average balance of outstanding borrowings increased $7.3 million or 26.2% to $35.2 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, compared to $27.9 million for the prior year quarterly period. The average rate paid on borrowings decreased 8 basis
points to 92 basis points for the recently ended quarter. 

Net interest margin decreased 22 basis
points from 3.93% for the prior year quarterly period to 3.71% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Provision for Losses on Loans  

The Company recorded $4,000 in provision
for losses on loans during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a $11,000 provision for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. There can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to absorb unidentified losses on loans
in the portfolio, which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations. 

Non-interest Income  

Non-interest income totaled $168,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $54,000 or 47.4% from the same period in 2015 due primarily to positive
experience with other real estate owned ( REO ). Net gains on sales of REO totaled $73,000 for the quarter just ended
compared to $16,000 for the prior year quarter, an increase of $57,000 period over period.  The Company recorded a write-down on REO during
the year ago quarter of $18,000, compared to no write-down on REO in the current year period. There were no sales of loans during
the recently ended quarter compared to gain on sale of loans of $19,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. There were
no sales of investments during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Non-interest Expense  

Non-interest expense increased $103,000
or 5.0% and totaled $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.1 million for the same period in
2015. 

Employee compensation and benefits increased
$65,000 or 5.1% and totaled $1.3 million for the quarterly period, primarily due to higher levels of compensation expense, retirement
contributions and fringe benefits. Employee compensation increased $31,000 quarter over quarter as the Company employed two more
full-time equivalent staff during the recently-ended period compared to the prior year, while pension contributions accounted for
$23,000 of the increase and the balance was primarily related to increased employee benefits. The Company participates in a multiple-employer
pension plan and, like most sponsors of defined benefit plans, is faced with increasing costs associated with the plans. Contributions
to the defined benefit pension plan totaled $174,000 and $151,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS   (continued)  

Occupancy and equipment expense increased
$34,000 or 23.0% to $182,000 for the quarter just ended primarily due to increased costs associated with newly-acquired bank offices
in Hazard and Frankfort. 

Other non-interest expense increased $19,000
or 7.5% to $271,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to increased advertising and communication costs
incurred by the Company. Advertising expense totaled $53,000 for the quarter recently ended as the Company seeks to develop top-of-mind
awareness in its local markets, while communications charges increased $24,000 or 85.7% to $52,000 for the quarter ended recently
to provide faster data transfer speeds. Somewhat offsetting the increased employee compensation, occupancy and equipment and other
non-interest expenses were decreases in legal and outside service fees. Legal fees decreased $16,000 or 55.2% to $13,000 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, while outside service fees decreased $7,000 or 14.6% to $41,000 for the quarter recently ended. 

Federal Income Tax Expense  

Federal income taxes expense
increased $26,000 or 19.4% and totaled $160,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $134,000 in the
prior year quarter primarily due to the reversal of an ASC 740 reserve related to a previously received federal tax refund
in the prior year period. The effective tax rates were 35.0% and 19.9% for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
