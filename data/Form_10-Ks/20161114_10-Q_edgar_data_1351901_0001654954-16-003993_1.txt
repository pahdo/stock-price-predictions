1. Business 

Commonwealth
Income   Growth Fund VI ( CIGF7  or the
 Partnership  or the  Fund ) is a limited
partnership organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on
January 6, 2006. The Partnership offered for sale up to 2,500,000
units of the limited partnership at the purchase price of $20 per
unit (the  offering ). The Partnership reached the
minimum amount in escrow and commenced operations on May 10, 2007.
The offering terminated on March 6, 2009 with 1,810,311 units sold
for a total of approximately $36,000,000 in limited partner
contributions. 

The
Partnership uses the proceeds of the offering to acquire, own and
lease various types of information technology equipment and other
similar capital equipment, which will be leased primarily to U.S.
corporations and institutions. Commonwealth Capital Corp.
( CCC ), on behalf of the Partnership and other
affiliated partnerships, acquires equipment subject to associated
debt obligations and lease agreements and allocates a participation
in the cost, debt and lease revenue to the various partnerships
that it manages based on certain risk factors. 

The
Partnership s General Partner is Commonwealth Income  
Growth Fund, Inc. (the  General Partner ), a
Pennsylvania corporation which is an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of CCC. CCC is a member of the Investment Program
Association (IPA), REISA, Financial Planning Association (FPA), and
the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA). Approximately
ten years after the commencement of operations, the Partnership
intends to sell or otherwise dispose of all of its equipment, make
final distributions to partners, and to dissolve. Unless sooner
terminated or extended pursuant to the terms of its Limited
Partnership Agreement, the Partnership will continue until December
31, 2018. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The
financial information presented as of any date other than December
31, 2015 has been prepared from the books and records without
audit. The following unaudited condensed financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial information as of
December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial
statements of the Partnership, but does not include all disclosures
required by generally accepted accounting principles to be included
in audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for
the periods indicated, have been included. Operating results for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of financial results that may be expected for the full
year ended December 31, 2016. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In June
2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-10,
 Technical Corrections and
Improvements-  Transition guidance varies based on the
amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update that
require transition guidance are effective for all entities for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will
be effective upon the issuance of this Update. The Partnership is
currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on its
financial statements. This was adopted January 1, 2016; however,
adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Partnership s
financial statements during the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

In
January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-01,  Income
Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the
Concept of Extraordinary Items.  Effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments
prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments
retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance
is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The
effective date is the same for both public business entities and
all other entities. The Partnership is currently evaluating the
effect that this ASU will have on its financial statements. This
was adopted January 1, 2016; however, adoption of this ASU had no
impact on the Partnership s financial statements since there
were no extraordinary and unusual items to report during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Estimated
fair value was determined by management using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
judgment was necessary to interpret market data and develop
estimated fair value. Cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities are
carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair values
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 due to the short
term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Partnership s long-term debt consists of notes payable, which
are secured by specific equipment and are nonrecourse liabilities
of the Partnership. The estimated fair value of this debt at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximates the carrying
value of these instruments, due to the interest rates on the debt
approximating current market interest rates. The Partnership
classifies the fair value of its notes payable within Level 2 of
the valuation hierarchy based on the observable inputs used to
estimate fair value. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

We
consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of 90 days or less. At September 30, 2016, cash
and cash equivalents was held in two accounts maintained at one
financial institution with an aggregate balance of approximately
$286,000. Bank accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 by the
FDIC. At September 30, 2016, the total cash balance was as
follows: 

The
Partnership believes it mitigates the risk of holding uninsured
deposits by only depositing funds with major financial
institutions. The Partnership has not experienced any losses in our
accounts, and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk. The amounts in such accounts will fluctuate throughout 2016
due to many factors, including cash receipts, equipment
acquisitions, interest rates and distributions to limited
partners. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
2016-15  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments - The amendments in this Update apply to all
entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit
entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows
under Topic 230. The amendments in this Update are effective for
public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all
other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Partnership
is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on its
financial statements. 

In
March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update-  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606):  No. 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients,  No. 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing  and No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations

respectively.   The
amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting
Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which is not yet
effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the
amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and
transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended
by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14,
 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ,
defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. Public
business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain
employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09
to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. The Partnership is
currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on its
financial statements.

are not public business entities may adopt the amendments in this
Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will

Date  - The amendments in this
Update defer the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities

entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the
guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
The Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU
will have on its financial statements.  

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014 -15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern  , requires management to
determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding the
entity s going concern presumption.  If substantial
doubt exists but is not alleviated by management s plans, the
footnotes must specifically state that  there is substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the financial statements are
issued.   In addition, if substantial doubt exists,
regardless of whether such doubt was alleviated, entities must
disclose (a) principal conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going
concern (before consideration of management s plans, if any);
(b) management s evaluation of the significance of those
conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to
meet its obligations; and (c) management s plans that are
intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise
substantial doubt, or that did alleviate substantial doubt, about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  If
substantial doubt has not been alleviated, these disclosures should
become more extensive in subsequent reporting periods as additional
information becomes available.  In the period that substantial
doubt no longer exists (before or after considering
management s plans), management should disclose how the
principal conditions and events that originally gave rise to
substantial doubt have been resolved.  The ASU applies
prospectively to all entities for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2016, and to annual and interim periods
thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  The
Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will
have on its financial statements.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with
Customers   (ASU 2014-09), which
supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under
U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize
revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an
entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU
2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle
and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required
within the revenue recognition process than are required under
existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein,
using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full
retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard
in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain
practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the
cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at
the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote
disclosures).  The Partnership is currently evaluating
the effect that this ASU will have on its financial
statements.  

3. Information Technology, Medical Technology, Telecommunications
Technology, Inventory Management and Other Business-Essential
Capital Equipment ( Equipment ) 

The
Partnership is the lessor of equipment under leases with periods
that generally will range from 12 to 48 months. In general,
associated costs such as repairs and maintenance, insurance and
property taxes are paid by the lessee. 

9 

Remarketing
fees will be paid to the leasing companies from which the
Partnership purchases leases. These are fees that are earned by the
leasing companies when the initial terms of the lease have been
met. The General Partner believes that this strategy adds value
since it entices the leasing company to remain actively involved
with lessee and encourages potential extensions, remarketing or
sale of equipment. This strategy is designed to minimize any
conflicts the leasing company may have with a new lessee and may
assist in maximizing overall portfolio performance. The remarketing
fee is tied into lease performance thresholds and is a factor in
the negotiation of the fee.    Remarketing fees of approximately
$4,000 were incurred for each of the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, there were no remarketing fees paid with cash or
netted against receivables due from such parties. 

In
December 2014, a significant lessee, ALSC, breached its Master
Lease Agreement ( MLA ) scheduled to terminate in
December 2015 and defaulted on its lease payments for equipment
shared by the Partnership and other affiliated Funds.  On
December 4, 2014, ALSC filed a voluntary petition for relief under
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware.  On April 2, 2015, CCC, on
behalf of the Funds, entered into a settlement agreement with the
parent company of ALSC for $3,500,000.  The
Partnership s share of this settlement was approximately
$84,000 of which $68,000 was recorded as a gain on termination of
leases included in lease revenue in the second quarter of
2015.  In addition, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the
release of all equipment leased to ALSC under the MLA to the
Partnerships.  

In
January 2015, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a Purchase
Agreement for the sale of the equipment to Medshare Technologies
(see note 7 - Medshare). 

Gains from the termination of leases are recognized when the lease
is modified and terminated concurrently.  Gains from lease
termination included in lease revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $4,000 and $79,000,
respectively. 

CCC, on behalf of the Partnership and on behalf of other affiliated
companies and partnerships ( partnerships ), acquires
equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease
agreements and allocates a participation in the cost, debt and
lease revenue to the various companies based on certain risk
factors.  

The Partnership s share of the cost of the equipment in which
it participates with other partnerships at September 30, 2016 was
approximately $4,776,000 and is included in the Partnership s
equipment on its balance sheet. The total cost of the equipment
shared by the Partnership with other partnerships at September 30,
2016 was approximately $10,578,000. The Partnership s share
of the outstanding debt associated with this equipment at September
30, 2016 was approximately $49,000 and is included in the
Partnership s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total
outstanding debt related to the equipment shared by the Partnership
at September 30, 2016 was approximately $139,000. 

The
Partnership s share of the cost of the equipment in which it
participates with other partnerships at December 31, 2015 was
approximately $5,111,000 and is included in the Partnership s
equipment on its balance sheet. The total cost of the equipment
shared by the Partnership with other partnerships at December 31,
2015 was approximately $11,246,000. The Partnership s share
of the outstanding debt associated with this equipment at December
31, 2015 was approximately $214,000 and is included in the
Partnership s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total
outstanding debt related to the equipment shared by the Partnership
at December 31, 2015 was approximately $660,000. 

As the
Partnership and the other programs managed by the General Partner
increase their overall portfolio size, opportunities for shared
participation are expected to continue. Sharing in the acquisition
of a lease portfolio gives the fund an opportunity to acquire
additional assets and revenue streams, while allowing the fund to
remain diversified and reducing its overall risk with respect to
one portfolio. As additional investment opportunities arise during
the remainder of 2016, the Partnership expects total shared
equipment and related debt to trend higher as the Partnership
builds its portfolio.

This
credit risk is assessed using an internally developed model which
incorporates credits scores from third party providers and our own
customer risk ratings and is periodically reviewed. Our internal
ratings are weighted based on the industry that the customer
operates in. Factors taken into consideration when assessing risk
include both general and industry specific qualitative and
quantitative metrics. We separately take in to consideration
payment history, open lawsuits, liens and judgments. Typically, we
will not extend credit to a company that has been in business for
less than 5 years or that has filed for bankruptcy within the same
period. Our internally based model may classify a company as high
risk based on our analysis of their audited financial statements
and their payment history. Additional considerations of high risk
may include history of late payments, open lawsuits and liens or
judgments. In an effort to mitigate risk, we typically require
deposits from those in this category.

leases.

related party receivables and payables are short term, unsecured
and non-interest bearing. 

Nine months ended September 30,

Reimbursable Expenses  

The General Partner
and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement by the Partnership
for the cost of goods, supplies or services obtained and used by
the General Partner in connection with the administration and
operation of the Partnership from third parties unaffiliated with
the General Partner. In addition, the General Partner and its
affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of certain expenses
incurred by the General Partner and its affiliates in connection
with the administration and operation of the
Partnership.  For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Partnership was charged approximately $158,000
and $196,000 in Other LP expense, respectively. 

$  384,000    

$  414,000    

Equipment Acquisition Fee  

The General Partner
earned an equipment acquisition fee of 4% of the purchase price of
each item of equipment purchased as compensation for the
negotiation of the acquisition of the equipment and lease thereof
or sale under a conditional sales contract. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the General Partner earned acquisition
fees from operating and finance leases of approximately $29,000 and
$0, respectively. 

$  29,000    

$  2,000    

Equipment Management Fee  

The General Partner
is entitled to be paid a monthly fee equal to the lesser of (a) the
fees which would be charged by an independent third party in the
same geographic market for similar services and equipment or (b)
the sum of (i) two percent of gross lease revenues attributable to
equipment subject to full payout net leases which contain net lease
provisions and (ii) five percent of the gross lease revenues
attributable to equipment subject to operating leases. Our general
partner, based on its experience in the equipment leasing industry
and current dealings with others in the industry, will use its
business judgment to determine if a given fee is competitive,
reasonable and customary. The amount of the fee will depend upon
the amount of equipment we manage, which in turn will depend upon
the amount we raise in this offering. Reductions in market rates
for similar services would also reduce the amount of this fee we
will receive. 

$  35,000    

$  78,000    

Debt Placement Fee  

As compensation for
arranging term debt to finance our acquisition of equipment, we
will pay the general partner a fee equal to one percent of such
indebtedness; provided, however, that such fee shall be reduced to
the extent we incur such fees to third parties unaffiliated with
the general partner or the lender with respect to such
indebtedness. No such fee will be paid with respect to borrowings
from the general partner or its affiliates. We intend to initially
acquire leases on an all cash basis with the proceeds of this
offering, but may borrow funds after the offering proceeds have
been invested. The amount we borrow, and therefore the amount of
the fee, will depend upon interest rates at the time of a loan, and
the amount of leverage we determine is appropriate at the time. We
do not intend to use more than 30% leverage overall in our
portfolio. Fees will increase as the amount of leverage we use
increases, and as turnover in the portfolio increases and
additional equipment is purchased using leverage. 

$  6,000    

$  400    

Equipment liquidation fee  

Also referred to as
a "resale fee." With respect to each item of equipment sold by the
general partner, we will pay a fee equal to the lesser of (i) 50%
of the competitive equipment sale commission or (ii) three percent
of the sales price of the equipment. The payment of this fee is
subordinated to the receipt by the limited partners of (i) a return
of their capital contributions and a 10% per annum cumulative
return, compounded daily, on adjusted capital contributions and
(ii) the net disposition proceeds from such sale in accordance with
the partnership agreement. Our general partner, based on its
experience in the equipment leasing industry and current dealings
with others in the industry, uses its business judgment to
determine if a given sales commission is competitive, reasonable
and customary. Such fee will be reduced to the extent any
liquidation or resale fees are paid to unaffiliated parties. The
amount of such fees will depend upon the sale price of equipment
sold. Sale prices will vary depending upon the type, age and
condition of equipment sold. The shorter the terms of our leases,
the more often we may sell equipment, which will increase
liquidation fees we receive. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the General Partner earned but waived approximately
$1,000 in equipment liquidation fees.

5. Notes Payable 

Notes payable consisted of the following approximate
amounts: 

The notes are secured by specific equipment with a carrying value
of approximately $896,000 as of September 30, 2016 and are
nonrecourse liabilities of the Partnership. As such, the notes do
not contain any financial debt covenants with which we must comply
on either an annual or quarterly basis. Aggregate maturities of
notes payable for each of the periods subsequent to September 30,
2016 are as follows:

6. Supplemental Cash Flow Information 

Other noncash activities included in the determination of net loss
are as follows: 

No interest or principal on notes payable was paid by the
Partnership because direct payment was made by lessee to the bank
in lieu of collection of lease income and payment of interest and
principal by the Partnership. 

Noncash investing and financing activities include the
following: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Partnership wrote-off fully amortized acquisition and finance fees
of approximately $25,000 and $61,000, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Partnership wrote-off fully depreciated equipment of approximately
$0 and $16,000, respectively.   

7. Commitments and Contingencies 

Allied Health Care Services 

As
previously disclosed in the Partnership s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, management wrote
off the fully reserved accounts receivable and fully impaired
assets related to the lease to Allied Health Care Services, Inc.
( Allied ), due to the bankruptcy of Allied and the
criminal conviction of its founder, Mr. Schwartz, for fraud. There
have been no material changes in the status of Allied s
bankruptcy or in the likelihood of recovering available assets
since the date of the Partnership s annual report. The
deadline for the bankruptcy trustee to pursue adversary claims
against certain creditors has expired, including extensions. The
bankruptcy trustee cannot seek to claim the Partnership's payments
received from Allied, therefore the Partnership has no exposure to
such potential claims. Commonwealth continues to pursue all of our
rights against both Allied and Mr. Schwartz to recover any
available assets to the greatest extent possible. During 2015,
Commonwealth received an Allied bankruptcy settlement of
approximately $448,000. The Partnership s portion was
approximately $242,000, which was included as a bad debt recovery
in the 2015 fourth quarter statement of financial operations. The
bankruptcy proceedings have been finalized and no further recovery
is expected. 

Medshare 

In
January 2015, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a Purchase
Agreement ( Purchase Agreement ) for the sale of the
equipment to Medshare Technologies ( Medshare ) for
approximately $3,400,000.  The Partnership s share of
the sale proceeds was approximately $77,000.  As of June 30,
2016, the Partnership has received approximately $53,000 of the
approximate $77,000 sale proceeds and has recorded a reserve
against the outstanding receivable of approximately $7,000. 
On April 3, 2015 Medshare was obligated to make payment in full and
failed to do so. As a result, Medshare defaulted on its purchase
agreement with CCC and was issued a demand letter for full payment
of the Equipment.  On June 25, 2015, Medshare filed a lawsuit
in Texas state court for breach of contract ( State
Suit ).  On June 26, 2015, Commonwealth filed a lawsuit
in the Northern District of Texas against Medshare seeking payment
in full and/or return of the Equipment and
damages.  

In July
2016, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a $1,400,000
binding Settlement Agreement ( Settlement Agreement )
with Medshare and its principal owner, Chris Cleary (collectively
referred to as  Defendants ), who are held jointly and
severally liable for the entire settlement. On August 2, 2016, the
Defendants made payment to CCC of an initial $200,000 to be
followed by 24 structured monthly payments of approximately $50,000
per month to begin no later than September 15, 2016. The
Partnership s share of the Settlement Agreement is
approximately $23,000 and is to be applied against the net Medshare
receivable of approximately $18,000 as of the settlement date. The
remaining $5,000 will be applied against the $7,000 reserve and
recorded as a bad debt recovery. As of October 31, 2016, the
Partnership received approximately $5,000 of the approximate
$23,000 settlement agreement which was applied against the net
Medshare receivable of approximately $18,000 as of the settlement
date. Should the Defendants default at any time, the settlement
agreement includes a consent judgment that allows CCC to seek
immediate judgment against the Defendants from a court of competent
jurisdiction for the liquidated damage amount of $1.5 million (less
any payment received after execution of the agreement). The
Partnership s share of the judgment would be approximately
$24,000. Based on discussions with counsel, management believes
that the likelihood of loss is remote.  As
such, management believes that the settlement of the lawsuits
will not result in any adverse financial impact on the Funds, but
no assurance can be provided until the proceeding is
resolved.

FINRA 

On May
3, 2013, the FINRA Department of Enforcement filed a complaint
naming Commonwealth Capital Securities Corp. ( CCSC )
and the owner of the firm, Kimberly Springsteen-Abbott, as
respondents; however on October 22, 2013, FINRA filed an amended
complaint that dropped the allegations against CCSC and reduced the
scope of the allegations against Ms. Springsteen-Abbott.  The
sole remaining charge was that Ms. Springsteen-Abbott had approved
the misallocation of some expenses to certain Funds. Management
believes that the expenses at issue include amounts that were
proper and that were properly allocated to Funds, and also
identified a smaller number of expenses that had been allocated in
error, but were adjusted and repaid to the affected Funds when they
were identified in 2012.  During the period in question,
Commonwealth Capital Corp. ( CCC ) and Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott provided important financial support to the
Funds, voluntarily absorbed expenses and voluntarily waived fees in
amounts aggregating in excess of any questioned allocations.
 That Panel ruled on March 30, 2015, that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott should be barred from the securities industry
because the Panel concluded that she allegedly misallocated
$208,000 of expenses involving certain Funds over the course of
three years.  As such, management has allocated approximately
$87,000 of the $208,000 in allegedly misallocated expenses back to
the affected funds as a contingency accrual in CCC s
financial statements and a good faith payment for the benefit of
those Income Funds.  Decisions issued by FINRA's Office of
Hearing Officers may be appealed to FINRA's National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC) pursuant to FINRA Rule 9311.  The NAC Decision
upheld the Panel s ruling.  Ms. Springsteen-Abbott has
appealed the NAC Decision to the SEC.   While a decision is on
appeal with the SEC, the sanctions for disgorgement and fines are
not enforced against the individual.  The bar took effect on
August 23, 2016.  Management believes that resolution of the
appeal will not result in any material adverse financial impact on
the Funds, but no assurance can be provided until the FINRA matter
is resolved.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

The Equipment Leasing and Finance Association's (ELFA) Monthly
Leasing and Finance Index (MLFI-25), which reports economic
activity from 25 companies representing a cross section of the $1
trillion equipment finance sector, showed their overall new
business volume for September was $9.4 billion, up 12%
year-over-year from new business volume in September 2015. Volume
was up 22% month-to-month from $7.7 billion in August. Year to
date, cumulative new business volume decreased 4% compared to
2015.  

ELFA President and CEO Ralph Petta said, "September new business
volume was strong, showing the first double-digit increase in many
months. Perhaps the Fed's decision to keep interest rates low has
contributed to this favorable environment for equipment investment
by businesses. The uncertainty caused by the upcoming Presidential
election, which has acted as a drag on overall economic growth and
low capital spending for most of this year, seems to have waned- at
least in the short term. It will be interesting to see if this
scenario continues into the final quarter.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

We
believe that our critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements. See Note 2 to our condensed financial
statements included herein for a discussion related to recent
accounting pronouncements. 

LEASE INCOME RECEIVABLE 

Lease
income receivable includes current lease income receivable net of
allowances for uncollectible amounts, if any. The Partnership
monitors lease income receivable to ensure timely and accurate
payment by lessees. The Partnership s Lease Relations
department is responsible for monitoring lease income receivable
and, as necessary, resolving outstanding invoices. 

The
Partnership reviews a customer s credit history before
extending credit. When the analysis indicates that the probability
of full collection is unlikely, the Partnership may establish an
allowance for uncollectible lease income receivable based upon the
credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other
information. The Partnership writes off its lease income receivable
when it determines that it is uncollectible and all economically
sensible means of recovery have been exhausted. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

As of September 30, 2016,  the Partnership s lease
portfolio consisted of operating leases and finance leases. For
operating leases, lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line
basis in accordance with the terms of the lease
agreement. 

Finance
lease interest income is recorded over the term of the lease using
the effective interest method. For finance leases, we record, at
lease inception, unearned finance lease income which is calculated
as follows: total lease payments, plus any residual value and
initial direct costs, less the cost of the leased
equipment. 

Upon
the end of the lease term, if the lessee has not met the return
conditions as set out in the lease, the Partnership is entitled in
certain cases to additional compensation from the lessee. The
Partnership s accounting policy for recording such payments
is to treat them as revenue. 

Gains
or losses from sales of leased and off-lease equipment are recorded
on a net basis in the Partnership s Statement of Operations.
Our leases do not contain any step-rent provisions or escalation
clauses nor are lease revenues adjusted based on any
index. 

Gains from the termination of leases are recognized when the lease
is modified and terminated concurrently.  Gains from lease
termination included in lease revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $4,000 and $79,000,
respectively. 

16 

LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

Depreciation
on technology and inventory management equipment for financial
statement purposes is based on the straight-line method estimated
generally over useful lives of two to five years. Once an asset
comes off lease or is released, the Partnership reassesses the
useful life of an asset. 

The
Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets when events or
circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may not be
recoverable. The Partnership determines whether impairment exists
by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each
asset. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the
carrying value of the asset then impairment exists. The amount of
the impairment is determined based on the difference between the
carrying value and the fair value. Fair value is determined based
on estimated discounted cash flows to be generated by the asset,
third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets, as
applicable, based on asset type. Residual values are determined by
management and are calculated using information from both internal
and external sources, as well as other economic
indicators 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

Our primary sources of cash for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, were cash provided by operating activities of approximately
$585,000, payments received from finance leases of approximately
$34,000 and net proceeds from the sale of equipment of
approximately $49,000, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015 where our primary sources of cash were provided by
operating activities of approximately $425,000, payments received
from finance leases of approximately $34,000 and net proceeds from
the sale of equipment of approximately $259,000. 

Our primary uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 were for the distributions to partners of approximately
$178,000, limited partner redemptions of approximately $98,000, the
purchase of new equipment of approximately $95,000 and equipment
acquisition fees of approximately $29,000. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, our primary uses of cash were for the
distributions to partners of approximately $778,000, limited
partner redemptions of approximately $13,000 and for the purchase
of new equipment of approximately $9,000. 

Cash was provided by operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 of approximately $585,000, which includes net
loss of approximately $340,000, depreciation and amortization
expenses of approximately $615,000 and gain on sale of computer
equipment of approximately $31,000.  Other noncash activities
included in the determination of net income include direct payments
to banks by lessees of approximately $250,000 and bad debt expense
of approximately $2,000.   For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, cash was provided by operating activities of
approximately $425,000, which includes net income of approximately
$52,000, depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately
$1,143,000 and gain on sale of computer equipment of approximately
$161,000.  Other noncash activities included in the
determination of net income include direct payments to banks by
lessees of approximately $278,000 and bad debt expense of
approximately $5,000. 

As we
continue to acquire equipment for the equipment portfolio,
operating expenses may increase, but because of our investment
strategy of leasing equipment primarily through triple-net leases,
we avoid operating expenses related to equipment maintenance or
taxes. 

CCC, on
our behalf and on behalf of other affiliated partnerships, acquires
equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease revenue
and allocates a participation in the cost, debt and lease revenue
to the various partnerships based on certain risk
factors. 

Capital expenditures and distributions are expected to continue to
increase overall during the remainder of 2016 as management focuses
on additional equipment acquisitions and funding limited partner
distributions. We intend to invest approximately
$1,000,000 

in additional equipment during the remainder of 2016, primarily
through debt financing. 

17 

We
consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of 90 days or less. At September 30, 2016, cash
and cash equivalents was held in two accounts maintained at one
financial institution with an aggregate balance of approximately
$286,000. Bank accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 by the
FDIC. At September 30, 2016, the total cash balance was as
follows: 

The
Partnership's deposits are fully insured by the FDIC. The
Partnership has not experienced any losses in our accounts, and
believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk. The
amounts in such accounts will fluctuate throughout 2016 due to many
factors, including cash receipts, interest rates and distributions
to limited partners. 

The Partnership s investment strategy of acquiring equipment
and generally leasing it under triple-net leases to operators who
generally meet specified financial standards minimizes our
operating expenses. As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership had
future minimum rentals on non-cancelable operating leases of
approximately $183,000 for the balance of the year ending December
31, 2016 and approximately $674,000 thereafter. As of September 30,
2016, the Partnership had future minimum rentals on non-cancelable
finance leases of approximately $11,000 for the balance of the year
ending December 31, 2016 and approximately $44,000
thereafter. 

As of September 30, 2016, our non-recourse debt was approximately
$689,000 with interest rates ranging from 1.60% to 4.88% and will
be payable through October 2019. 

In
December 2014, a significant lessee, ALSC, breached its Master
Lease Agreement ( MLA ) scheduled to terminate in
December 2015 and defaulted on its lease payments for equipment
shared by the Partnership and other affiliated Funds.  On
December 4, 2014, ALSC filed a voluntary petition for relief under
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware.  On April 2, 2015, CCC, on
behalf of the Funds, entered into a settlement agreement with the
parent company of ALSC for $3,500,000.  The
Partnership s share of this settlement was approximately
$84,000 of which $68,000 was recorded as a gain on termination of
leases included in lease revenue in the second quarter of
2015.  In addition, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the
release of all equipment leased to ALSC under the MLA to the
Partnerships. 

In
January 2015, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a Purchase
Agreement ( Purchase Agreement ) for the sale of the
equipment to Medshare Technologies ( Medshare ) for
approximately $3,400,000.  The Partnership s share of
the sale proceeds was approximately $77,000.  As of June 30,
2016, the Partnership has received approximately $53,000 of the
approximate $77,000 sale proceeds and has recorded a reserve
against the outstanding receivable of approximately $7,000. 
On April 3, 2015 Medshare was obligated to make payment in full and
failed to do so. As a result, Medshare defaulted on its purchase
agreement with CCC and was issued a demand letter for full payment
of the Equipment.  On June 25, 2015, Medshare filed a lawsuit
in Texas state court for breach of contract ( State
Suit ).  On June 26, 2015, Commonwealth filed a lawsuit
in the Northern District of Texas against Medshare seeking payment
in full and/or return of the Equipment and
damages.  

In July
2016, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a $1,400,000
binding Settlement Agreement ( Settlement Agreement )
with Medshare and its principal owner, Chris Cleary (collectively
referred to as  Defendants ), who are held jointly and
severally liable for the entire settlement. On August 2, 2016, the
Defendants made payment to CCC of an initial $200,000 to be
followed by 24 structured monthly payments of approximately $50,000
per month to begin no later than September 15, 2016. The
Partnership s share of the Settlement Agreement is
approximately $23,000 and is to be applied against the net Medshare
receivable of approximately $18,000. The remaining $5,000 will be
applied against the $7,000 reserve and recorded as a bad debt
recovery. As of October 31, 2016, the Partnership received
approximately $5,000 of the approximate $23,000 settlement
agreement which was applied against the net Medshare receivable of
approximately $18,000. Should the Defendants default at any time,
the settlement agreement includes a consent judgment that allows
CCC to seek immediate judgment against the Defendants from a court
of competent jurisdiction for the liquidated damage amount of $1.5
million (less any payment received after execution of the
agreement). The Partnership s share of the judgment would be
approximately $24,000. Based on discussions with counsel,
management believes that the likelihood of loss is remote.  As
such, management believes that the settlement of the lawsuits
will not result in any adverse financial impact on the Funds, but
no assurance can be provided until the proceeding is
resolved.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

Lease Revenue 

Our lease revenue declined to approximately $239,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $431,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The Partnership
had 52 and 70 active operating leases for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This decline was
primarily due to fewer acquisitions of new leases during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the termination of
leases in the third quarter of 2015.  Management expects to
add new leases to the Partnership s portfolio during the
fourth quarter of 2016, primarily through debt
financing. 

Sale of Equipment 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership sold
equipment, held under operating leases, with net book value of
approximately $18,000 for a net gain of approximately $11,000.
 This compares to the three months ended September 30, 2015,
when the Partnership sold fully depreciated equipment with zero net
book value for a net gain of approximately $141,000. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses, excluding depreciation, primarily consist
of accounting and legal fees, outside service fees and
reimbursement of expenses to CCC for administration and operation
of the Partnership. These expenses increased to approximately
$109,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from
approximately $103,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015.   This increase is primarily attributable to an
increase in other LP expenses of approximately $2,000 and
accounting/legal fees of approximate approximately
$4,000. 

Equipment Management Fees 

We pay an equipment management fee to our general partner for
managing our equipment portfolio. The equipment management fee is
approximately 5% of the gross lease revenue attributable to
equipment that is subject to operating leases and approximately 2%
of the gross lease revenue attributable to equipment that is
subject to direct financing leases. The equipment management fee
decreased to approximately $12,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, from approximately $22,000 for the three months
ended 

September 30, 2015. This decline in equipment management fees is
consistent with the decrease in lease revenue as described
above. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on
equipment and amortization of equipment acquisition fees. These
expenses decreased to approximately $200,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $347,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was due to the
higher frequency in the termination of leases and equipment being
fully depreciated as compared to the acquisition of new leases for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net (Loss) Income 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized
revenue of approximately $252,000 and expenses of approximately
$323,000, resulting in net loss of approximately $71,000.  For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized revenue of
approximately $575,000 and expenses of approximately $476,000,
resulting in net income of approximately $99,000.  This change
in net (loss) income is due to the changes in revenue and expenses
as described above. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2015 

Lease Revenue 

Our lease revenue declined to approximately $687,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $1,542,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Partnership had
61 and 78 active operating leases for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   This
decrease was primarily due to fewer acquisitions of new leases
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
termination of leases and the default of a significant lessee in
the second quarter of 2015 (note 3   ALSC disclosure).
Management expects to add new leases to the Partnership s
portfolio throughout 2016, primarily through debt
financing. 

19 

Sale of Equipment 

We sold equipment, held under operating leases, with net book value
of approximately $18,000 for a net gain of approximately $31,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This compares
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, when we sold
equipment, held under operating leases, with net book value of
approximately $98,000 for a net gain of approximately
$161,000. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses, excluding depreciation, primarily consist
of accounting and legal fees, outside service fees and
reimbursement of expenses to CCC for administration and operation
of the Partnership. These expenses decreased to approximately
$403,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from
approximately $420,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015.  This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease
in Other LP expense of approximately $38,000 and Partnership taxes
of approximately $11,000, offset by an increase in legal fees of
approximately $13,000 as a result of the Medshare Settlement
Agreement (see Note 8),  and an
allocation from CCC of approximately $21,000 recorded as a
reduction in 2015 operating expenses . 

Equipment Management Fees 

We pay an equipment management fee to our general partner for
managing our equipment portfolio. The equipment management fee is
approximately 5% of the gross lease revenue attributable to
equipment that is subject to operating leases and approximately 2%
of the gross lease revenue attributable to equipment that is
subject to direct financing leases. The equipment management fee
decreased to approximately $35,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from approximately $78,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  This decline is consistent with the
overall decrease in lease revenue. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on
equipment and amortization of equipment acquisition fees. These
expenses decreased to approximately $615,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $1,143,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was due
to the higher frequency in the termination of leases and equipment
being fully depreciated as compared to the acquisition of new
leases  for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Net (Loss) Income 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized revenue
of approximately $722,000 and expenses of approximately $1,062,000,
resulting in a net loss of approximately $340,000.  For the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized revenue of
approximately $1,713,000 and expenses of approximately $1,661,000,
resulting in a net income of approximately $52,000. This change in
net (loss) income is due to the changes in revenue and expenses as
described above. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

N/A 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of
the General Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures related to our reporting and
disclosure obligations as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the
General Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016,
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
that information relating to us which is required to be disclosed
in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (b) accumulated
and communicated to management, including the General
Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. There were no changes in the
Partnership s internal control over financial reporting
during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control
over financial reporting.

Part II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.   Legal
Proceedings  

Allied Health Care Services 

As
previously disclosed in the Partnership s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, management wrote
off the fully reserved accounts receivable and fully impaired
assets related to the lease to Allied Health Care Services, Inc.
( Allied ), due to the bankruptcy of Allied and the
criminal conviction of its founder, Mr. Schwartz, for fraud. There
have been no material changes in the status of Allied s
bankruptcy or in the likelihood of recovering available assets
since the date of the Partnership s annual report. The
deadline for the bankruptcy trustee to pursue adversary claims
against certain creditors has expired, including extensions. The
bankruptcy trustee cannot seek to claim the Partnership's payments
received from Allied, therefore the Partnership has no exposure to
such potential claims. Commonwealth continues to pursue all of our
rights against both Allied and Mr. Schwartz to recover any
available assets to the greatest extent possible. During 2015,
Commonwealth received an Allied bankruptcy settlement of
approximately $448,000. The Partnership s portion was
approximately $242,000, which was included as a bad debt recovery
in the 2015 fourth quarter statement of financial operations. The
bankruptcy proceedings have been finalized and no further recovery
is expected. 

Medshare 

In
January 2015, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a Purchase
Agreement ( Purchase Agreement ) for the sale of the
equipment to Medshare Technologies ( Medshare ) for
approximately $3,400,000.  The Partnership s share of
the sale proceeds was approximately $77,000.  As of June 30,
2016, the Partnership has received approximately $53,000 of the
approximate $77,000 sale proceeds and has recorded a reserve
against the outstanding receivable of approximately $7,000. 
On April 3, 2015 Medshare was obligated to make payment in full and
failed to do so. As a result, Medshare defaulted on its purchase
agreement with CCC and was issued a demand letter for full payment
of the Equipment.  On June 25, 2015, Medshare filed a lawsuit
in Texas state court for breach of contract ( State
Suit ).  On June 26, 2015, Commonwealth filed a lawsuit
in the Northern District of Texas against Medshare seeking payment
in full and/or return of the Equipment and
damages.  

In July
2016, CCC, on behalf of the Funds, entered into a $1,400,000
binding Settlement Agreement ( Settlement Agreement )
with Medshare and its principal owner, Chris Cleary (collectively
referred to as  Defendants ), who are held jointly and
severally liable for the entire settlement. On August 2, 2016, the
Defendants made payment to CCC of an initial $200,000 to be
followed by 24 structured monthly payments of approximately $50,000
per month to begin no later than September 15, 2016. The
Partnership s share of the Settlement Agreement is
approximately $23,000 and is to be applied against the net Medshare
receivable of approximately $18,000 as of the settlement date. The
remaining $5,000 will be applied against the $7,000 reserve and
recorded as a bad debt recovery. As of October 31, 2016, the
Partnership received approximately $5,000 of the approximate
$23,000 settlement agreement which was applied against the net
Medshare receivable of approximately $18,000 as of the settlement
date. Should the Defendants default at any time, the settlement
agreement includes a consent judgment that allows CCC to seek
immediate judgment against the Defendants from a court of competent
jurisdiction for the liquidated damage amount of $1.5 million (less
any payment received after execution of the agreement). The
Partnership s share of the judgment would be approximately
$24,000. Based on discussions with counsel, management believes
that the likelihood of loss is remote.  As
such, management believes that the settlement of the lawsuits
will not result in any adverse financial impact on the Funds, but
no assurance can be provided until the proceeding is
resolved. 

21 

FINRA 

On May
3, 2013, the FINRA Department of Enforcement filed a complaint
naming Commonwealth Capital Securities Corp. ( CCSC )
and the owner of the firm, Kimberly Springsteen-Abbott, as
respondents; however on October 22, 2013, FINRA filed an amended
complaint that dropped the allegations against CCSC and reduced the
scope of the allegations against Ms. Springsteen-Abbott.  The
sole remaining charge was that Ms. Springsteen-Abbott had approved
the misallocation of some expenses to certain Funds. Management
believes that the expenses at issue include amounts that were
proper and that were properly allocated to Funds, and also
identified a smaller number of expenses that had been allocated in
error, but were adjusted and repaid to the affected Funds when they
were identified in 2012.  During the period in question,
Commonwealth Capital Corp. ( CCC ) and Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott provided important financial support to the
Funds, voluntarily absorbed expenses and voluntarily waived fees in
amounts aggregating in excess of any questioned allocations.
 That Panel ruled on March 30, 2015, that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott should be barred from the securities industry
because the Panel concluded that she allegedly misallocated
$208,000 of expenses involving certain Funds over the course of
three years.  As such, management has allocated approximately
$87,000 of the $208,000 in allegedly misallocated expenses back to
the affected funds as a contingency accrual in CCC s
financial statements and a good faith payment for the benefit of
those Income Funds.  Decisions issued by FINRA's Office of
Hearing Officers may be appealed to FINRA's National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC) pursuant to FINRA Rule 9311.  The NAC Decision
upheld the Panel s ruling.  Ms. Springsteen-Abbott has
appealed the NAC Decision to the SEC.   While a decision is on
appeal with the SEC, the sanctions for disgorgement and fines are
not enforced against the individual.  The bar took effect on
August 23, 2016.  Management believes that resolution of the
appeal will not result in any material adverse financial impact on
the Funds, but no assurance can be provided until the FINRA matter
is resolved.
