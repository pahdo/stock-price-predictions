Note 1   Organization 
  Evercore Partners Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") is an investment banking and investment management firm, incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 2005 and headquartered in New York, New York. The Company is a holding company which owns a controlling interest in Evercore LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Evercore LP"). Subsequent to the Company s initial public offering, the Company became the sole general partner of Evercore LP. The Company operates from its offices and through its affiliates in North America, Europe, South America and Asia. 
  The Investment Banking business includes the advisory business through which the Company provides advice to clients on significant mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic corporate transactions, with a particular focus on advising prominent multinational corporations and substantial private equity firms on large, complex transactions. The Company also provides restructuring advice to companies in financial transition, as well as to creditors, shareholders and potential acquirers. In addition, the Company provides its clients with capital markets advice, underwrites securities offerings, raises funds for financial sponsors and provides advisory services focused on secondary transactions for private funds interests. The Investment Banking business also includes the Evercore ISI business through which the Company offers macroeconomic, policy and fundamental equity research and agency-based equity securities trading for institutional investors. 
  The Investment Management business includes the institutional asset management business through which the Company, directly and through affiliates, manages financial assets for sophisticated institutional investors and provides independent fiduciary services to corporate employee benefit plans and high net-worth individuals, the wealth management business through which the Company provides investment advisory and wealth management services for high net-worth individuals and associated entities, and the private equity business through which the Company, through affiliates, manages private equity funds. 
   
  Note 2   Significant Accounting Policies 
  For a further discussion of the Company's accounting policies, refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain certain condensed financial information and exclude certain footnote disclosures normally included in audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, necessary to fairly present the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The   December 31, 2015   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
  The accompanying   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   of the Company are comprised of the consolidation of Evercore LP and Evercore LP s wholly-owned and majority-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Evercore Group L.L.C. ("EGL"), a registered broker-dealer in the U.S. The Company s policy is to consolidate all subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial interest, as well as any variable interest entities ("VIEs") where the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, when it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb significant losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment is a VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by the Company. The consolidation analysis is generally performed qualitatively. This analysis, which requires judgment, is performed at each reporting date.

In February 2015, Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-02,   "Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,"   ("ASU 2015-02")     was issued. This ASU eliminates the deferral of ASU No. 2010-10,   "Amendments for Certain Investment Funds,"   which allows reporting entities with interests in certain investment funds to follow the consolidation guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") No. 810,   "Consolidation,"   ("ASC 810") and makes other changes to the variable interest model and the voting model. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation performed by reporting entities on limited partnerships and similar entities and also impacts the evaluation performed by reporting entities on VIE determination, and determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.   
  The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2015-02, Evercore LP is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company consolidated Evercore LP as a voting interest entity. Specifically, the Company has the majority economic interest in Evercore LP and has decision making authority that significantly affects the economic performance of the entity while the limited partners have no kick-out or substantive participating rights. The assets and liabilities of Evercore LP represent substantially all of the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Company with the exception of U.S. corporate taxes and related items, which are presented on the Company's (Parent Company Only) statements of financial position in Note 23 to the Company s consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  International Strategy   Investment (UK) Limited ("ISI UK") is also a VIE pursuant to ASC 810 and the Company is the primary beneficiary of this VIE. Specifically, the Company provides financial support through a transfer pricing agreement with this entity, which exposes the Company to losses that are potentially significant to the entity, and has decision making authority that significantly affects the economic performance of the entity. The Company previously concluded that Evercore Asia Limited ("Evercore Asia") and Evercore Asia (Singapore) PTE. LTD. ("Evercore Singapore") were also VIEs; on July 1, 2016, the Company terminated the transfer pricing arrangements with Evercore Asia and Evercore Singapore. The Company viewed this modification as a reconsideration event under ASC 810-10 and concluded that Evercore Asia and Evercore Singapore are not VIEs and will continue to be consolidated as voting interest entities. Following the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company also concluded that Evercore Partners International LLP ("EPI LLP") is a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of this VIE. The Company has the majority economic interest in EPI LLP and has decision making authority that significantly affects the economic performance of this entity. The Company included in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition ISI UK and EPI LLP assets of   $111,905   and liabilities of   $73,781   at September 30, 2016 and Evercore Asia, Evercore Singapore, ISI UK and EPI LLP assets of   $151,583   and liabilities of   $110,424   at December 31, 2015. See Note 8 for further information on the Company's VIEs. 
  All intercompany balances and transactions with the Company s subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.

The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a

performance condition.

  ASU 2015-02   - In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis"   ("ASU 2015-02").

Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, 3. Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and 4.

The amendments in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.

  ASU 2015-03   - In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs"   ("ASU 2015-03"). ASU 2015-03 provides amendments to Subtopic 835-30,   "Interest - Imputation of Interest,"   which require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in this update are effective retrospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.

ASU 2015-16 provides amendments to ASC No. 805, "  Business Combinations,"   which simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments and require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments also require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this update are effective prospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.

This update will result in excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the delivery of Class A common stock under share-based payment arrangements being recognized in the Company's Provision for Income Taxes, rather than in Additional Paid-In-Capital under the current standard, which will result in greater volatility in the effective tax rate and could be material to the results of operations and the classifications of cash flows in future periods depending upon the level of earnings and stock price of the Company, among other things. 
  ASU 2016-13   - In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"   ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 provides amendments to ASC No. 326,   "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,"   which amend the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments and adds an impairment model (the current expected credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Entities will recognize an allowance for its estimate of expected credit losses as of the end of each reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or disclosures thereto. 
  ASU 2016-15 -   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments"   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 provides amendments to ASC No. 230, "  Statement of Cash Flows,  " which provide guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective retrospectively, or prospectively, if retrospective application is impracticable, during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or disclosures thereto.

Scheduled maturities of the Company s available-for-sale debt securities within the Securities Investments portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:   

Since the Company has the ability and intent to hold available-for-sale securities until a recovery of fair value is equal to an amount approximating its amortized cost, which may be at maturity, and has not incurred credit losses on its securities, it does not consider such unrealized loss positions to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

  Note 7       Financial Instruments Owned and Pledged as Collateral at Fair Value, Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
  The Company, through Evercore Casa de Bolsa, S.A. de C.V. ("ECB"), enters into repurchase agreements with clients seeking overnight money market returns whereby ECB transfers to the clients Mexican government securities in exchange for cash and concurrently agrees to repurchase the securities at a future date for an amount equal to the cash exchanged plus a stipulated premium or interest factor. ECB deploys the cash received from, and acquires the securities deliverable to, clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market, which the Company reflects as Financial Instruments Owned and Pledged as Collateral at Fair Value on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition  , or by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties. The Company accounts for these repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing transactions, which are carried at their contract amounts, which approximate fair value given that the contracts mature the following business day. The Company records a liability on its   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition   in relation to repurchase transactions executed with clients as Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase. The Company records as assets on its   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition  , Financial Instruments Owned and Pledged as Collateral at Fair Value (where the Company has acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market) and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell (where the Company has acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase agreements by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties). These Mexican government securities had an estimated average time to maturity of approximately   1.6

years  ,   as of September 30, 2016  , and are pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements. Generally, collateral is posted equal to the contract value at inception and is subject to market changes. These repurchase agreements are primarily with institutional customer accounts managed by ECB and permit the counterparty to pledge the securities. 
  ECB has procedures in place to monitor the daily risk limits for positions taken, as well as the credit risk based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against their contract value from inception to maturity date. The daily risk measure is Value at Risk ("VaR"), which is a statistical measure, at a   98%   confidence level, of the potential daily losses from adverse market movements in an ordinary market environment based on a historical simulation using the prior year s historical data. ECB s Risk Management Committee (the "Committee") has established a policy to maintain VaR at levels below   0.1%   of the value of the portfolio. If at any point in time the threshold is exceeded, ECB personnel are alerted by an automated interface with ECB s trading systems and begin to make adjustments in the portfolio in order to mitigate the risk and bring the portfolio in compliance. Concurrently, ECB personnel must notify the Committee of the variance and the actions taken to reduce the exposure to loss. 
  In addition to monitoring VaR, ECB periodically performs discrete stress tests to assure that the level of potential losses that would arise from extreme market movements that may not be anticipated by VaR measures are within acceptable levels.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a summary of the Company s assets, liabilities and collateral received or pledged related to these transactions was as follows:

("G5   Evercore"), ABS Investment Management, LLC ("ABS") and Atalanta Sosnoff Capital, LLC ("Atalanta Sosnoff"), which are voting interest entities. The Company s share of earnings (losses) on its investments in G5   Evercore, ABS and Atalanta Sosnoff (after its deconsolidation on December 31, 2015) are included within Income from Equity Method Investments on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . 
  Investments in Private Equity 
  Private Equity Funds 
  The Company s investments related to private equity partnerships and associated entities include investments in Evercore Capital Partners II, L.P. ("ECP II"), Discovery Americas I, L.P. (the "Discovery Fund"), Glisco Mexico Capital Partners II, L.P. ("GMCP II," formerly Evercore Mexico Capital Partners II, L.P., or EMCP II), Glisco Mexico Capital Partners III, L.P. ("GMCP III," formerly Evercore Mexico Capital Partners III, L.P., or EMCP III), Trilantic Capital Partners Associates IV, L.P. ("Trilantic IV") and Trilantic Capital Partners V, L.P. ("Trilantic V").

value. Additionally, the Company reflects its pro rata share of realized gains, losses and carried interest associated with any investment realizations. 
  On December 31, 2014, ECP II was terminated. The Company's investment at   September 30, 2016   of   $945   is comprised of its remaining interest in the general partner, including   $863   in cash and   $82   in securities. In addition, on September 12, 2016 the final distribution related to CSI Capital, L.P. ("CSI Capital") was made. 
  A summary of the Company s investment in the private equity funds as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

Net realized and unrealized gains on private equity fund investments were   $171   and   $6,302     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $1,933   and   $3,259     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Trilantic IV made distributions of   $3,092   and   $3,304  , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, ECP II, GMCP II, CSI Capital and Trilantic IV made distributions of   $3,000  ,   $3,194  ,   $2,909   and   $1,650  , respectively.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1,400   of previously distributed carried interest that may be subject to repayment. 
  General Partners of Private Equity Funds which are VIEs 
  The Company has concluded that Evercore Partners II, L.L.C. ("EP II L.L.C."), the general partner of ECP II, is a VIE pursuant to ASC 810. The Company owned   8%  -  9%   of the carried interest earned by the general partner of ECP II. The Company's assessment of the design of EP II L.L.C. resulted in the determination that the Company is not acting as an agent for other members of the general partner and is a passive holder of interests in the fund, evidenced by the fact that the Company is a non-voting, non-managing member of the general partner and, therefore, has no authority in directing the management operations of the general partner. Furthermore, the Company does not have the obligation to absorb significant losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially have a significant impact to EP II L.L.C. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of EP II L.L.C. and has not consolidated EP II L.L.C. in the Company's   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
  Glisco Transaction 
  On July 19, 2016, the Company and the principals of its Mexican Private Equity business entered into an agreement to transfer ownership of its Mexican Private Equity business and related entities to Glisco Partners Inc. ("Glisco"), which assumed all responsibility for the management of the existing funds GMCP II and GMCP III, and is controlled by the principals. These principals ceased to be employed by the Company following this transaction. An SMD of the Company will continue to serve on the Investment Committee for the funds. This transaction received consent from the Limited Partner Advisory Committee of the funds and regulatory approval in Mexico during the third quarter of 2016 and closed on September 30, 2016. 
  As consideration for this transaction, the Company will receive a fixed percentage of the management fees earned by Glisco for a period of up to   ten years  , as well as a portion of the carried interest in the next   two   successor funds. The Company  committed to invest capital in those successor funds consistent with the level of carried interest it owns and will retain its carried interest and its capital interests in the existing funds. The Company is entitled to   20%   of the carried interest in such successor funds. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company entered into a transition services agreement to provide operational support to Glisco for a period of up to   18 months  .

   (dollars and share / unit amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted) 

Following this transaction, the Company ceased to have a general partner s interest in and deconsolidated Glisco Mexico Partners II and III ("GMP II" and "GMP III," formerly Evercore Mexico Partners II and III, the General Partners of GMCP II and GMCP III) and related subsidiaries. Going forward the Company will maintain a limited partner s interest in the general partners of the funds. 
  In addition, the Company maintains a limited partner s interest in Glisco Manager Holdings LP, from which the Company will receive its portion of the management fees earned by Glisco. The Company s investment in Glisco Manager Holdings LP will be accounted for as a cost method investment.  
  As a result of this transaction, on September 30, 2016 the Company deconsolidated assets and liabilities of   $8,302   and   $2,343  , respectively, and recorded an investment in Glisco Manager Holdings LP of   $2,519  , representing the fair value of the deferred consideration resulting from this transaction. Furthermore, this resulted in a decrease in Noncontrolling Interest of   $5,808   at September 30, 2016 related to GMP III. In addition, the transaction resulted in a gain on deconsolidation of   $406  , included in Other Revenue on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
  Following this transaction, the Company concluded that GMP II, GMP III and Glisco Manager Holdings LP are VIEs and that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. The Company's assessment of the primary beneficiary of these entities included assessing which parties have the power to significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be potentially significant to the entities, or the right to receive benefits from the entities that could be potentially significant. Neither the Company nor its related parties will have the ability to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. Further, as a limited partner in these entities, the Company does not possess substantive participating rights. The Company had assets of   $8,654   included in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   related to these unconsolidated VIEs, representing the carrying value of the Company's investments in the entities. The Company s exposure to the obligations of these VIEs is generally limited to its investments in these entities. The Company's maximum exposure to loss   as of September 30, 2016   was   $10,981  , which represents the carrying value of the Company's investments in these VIEs, as well as any unfunded commitments to the current funds.    
  Investment in Trilantic Capital Partners and Others 
  In 2010, the Company made a limited partnership investment in Trilantic in exchange for   500   Class A limited partnership units of Evercore LP ("Class A LP Units") having a fair value of   $16,090  . This investment gave the Company the right to invest in Trilantic s current and future private equity funds, beginning with Trilantic Fund IV. The Company accounts for this investment under the cost method, subject to impairment. The Company allocates the cost of this investment to its investments in current and future Trilantic funds, as the Company satisfies the capital calls of these funds. The Company bases this allocation on its expectation of Trilantic s future fundraising ability and performance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   $612   and   $50   of this investment was allocated to Trilantic Fund V and IV, respectively. During 2015,   $636   and   $8   of this investment was allocated to Trilantic Fund V and IV, respectively. During 2014,   $689   of this investment was allocated to Trilantic Fund V. From 2010 to 2013,   $825   and   $1,120   of this investment was allocated to Trilantic Fund V and IV, respectively. This investment had a balance of   $12,150   and   $12,812   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company has a   $5,000   commitment to invest in Trilantic Fund V, of which   $2,550   was unfunded at   September 30, 2016  . The Company and Trilantic anticipate that the Company will participate in the successor funds to Trilantic Fund V. The Company further anticipates that participation in the successor fund will be at approximately   $12,000  . 
  In the second quarter of 2015, the Company received an equity security in a private company with a fair value of   $1,079   in exchange for advisory services. This investment is accounted for on the cost basis.

  Note 9   Fair Value Measurements 
  ASC 820, "  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"   ("ASC 820") establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily-available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. 
  Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 
  Level I   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level I include listed equities and listed derivatives. As required by ASC 820, the Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.

   (dollars and share / unit amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted) 

Level II   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. The estimated fair values of the Corporate Bonds, Municipal Bonds, Other Debt Securities and Securities Investments held at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are based on quoted market prices provided by external pricing services. 
  Level III   Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 
  The following table presents the categorization of investments and certain other financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Includes   $9,667   and   $9,653   of treasury bills, municipal bonds and commercial paper classified within Cash and Cash Equivalents on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
     In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 
  The Company had no transfers between fair value levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company determined that the fair value of the goodwill in its Institutional Asset Management reporting unit was   $66,200  . The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated by utilizing both a market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow methodology based on the adjusted cash flows from operations. Goodwill is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as a Level III asset.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities: 
  The fair value of the Company s Closely-held Equity Security is based on recent comparable market transactions executed by the issuer. 
  The fair value of the Company s Loans Receivable, Notes Payable and Subordinated Borrowings is estimated based on a present value analysis utilizing aggregate market yields obtained from independent pricing sources for similar financial instruments. 
  The carrying amounts reported on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition   for Cash and Cash Equivalents, Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Accounts Receivable, Receivable from Employees and Related Parties, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses, Payable to Employees and Related Parties, and Assets Segregated for Bank Regulatory Requirements approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. 
   
  Note 10   Notes Payable and Subordinated Borrowings 
  On March 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of   $170,000   of senior notes, including:   $38,000   aggregate principal amount of its   4.88%   Series A senior notes due 2021 (the "Series A Notes"),   $67,000   aggregate principal amount of its   5.23%   Series B senior notes due 2023 (the "Series B Notes"),   $48,000   aggregate principal amount of its   5.48%   Series C senior notes due 2026 (the "Series C Notes") and   $17,000   aggregate principal amount of its   5.58%   Series D senior notes due 2028 (the "Series D Notes" and together with the Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and the Series C Notes, the "Private Placement Notes"), pursuant to a note purchase agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement") dated as of March 30, 2016, among the Company and the purchasers party thereto in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.  
  Interest on the Private Placement Notes is payable semi-annually and the Private Placement Notes are guaranteed by certain of the Company's material domestic subsidiaries. The Company may, at its option, prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the Private Placement Notes (without regard to Series), in an amount not less than   5%   of the aggregate principal amount of the Private Placement Notes then outstanding at   100%   of the principal amount thereof plus an applicable "make-whole amount." Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the holders of the Private Placement Notes will have the right to require the Company to prepay the entire unpaid principal amounts held by each holder of the Private Placement Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary covenants, including financial covenants requiring compliance with a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum interest coverage ratio, and customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants. 
  The Company used   $120,000   of the net proceeds from the Private Placement Notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. ("Mizuho") on March 30, 2016 and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
  Notes Payable is comprised of the following as of   September 30, 2016  :   
   
   (a)   Carrying value has been adjusted to reflect the presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct reduction from the related  liability.

   (dollars and share / unit amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted) 

(a) 
    The Company has outstanding LP Units in its subsidiary, Evercore LP, which give the holders the right to receive Class A Shares upon exchange on a   one  -for-one basis. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the LP Units were antidilutive and consequently the effect of their exchange into Class A Shares has been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Evercore Partners Inc. common shareholders. The units that would have been included in the denominator of the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to Evercore Partners Inc. common shareholders if the effect would have been dilutive were   6,410   and   6,440     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   6,545   and   6,682     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . The adjustment to the numerator, diluted net income attributable to Class A common shareholders, if the effect would have been dilutive, would have been   $5,972   and   $11,235     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $1,576   and   $4,391     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . In computing this adjustment, the Company assumes that all vested Class A LP Units and all Class E limited partnership units of Evercore LP ("Class E LP Units") are converted into Class A Shares, that all earnings attributable to those shares are attributed to Evercore Partners Inc. and, that it has adopted a conventional corporate tax structure and is taxed as a C

Corporation in the U.S. at prevailing corporate tax rates.  The Company does not anticipate that the LP Units will result in a dilutive computation in future periods.  
           (b) 
    At   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company has outstanding Class G and H limited partnership interests of Evercore LP ("Class G and H LP Interests") which are contingently exchangeable into Class E LP Units, and ultimately Class A Shares, as they are subject to certain performance thresholds being achieved. See Note 14 for a further discussion. For the purposes of calculating diluted net income per share attributable to Evercore Partners Inc. common shareholders, the Company s Class G and H LP Interests will be included in diluted weighted average Class A Shares outstanding as of the beginning of the period in which all necessary performance conditions have been satisfied. If all necessary performance conditions have not been satisfied by the end of the period, the number of shares that will be included in diluted weighted average Class A Shares outstanding will be based on the number of shares that would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the performance period. The interests that were assumed to be converted to an equal number of Class A Shares for purposes of computing diluted EPS were   2,714   and   2,971     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   2,271   and   1,269     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  .  
              (c) 
    In November 2015, Mizuho exercised in full its outstanding Warrants to purchase   5,455   Class A Shares, of which the Company repurchased   2,355   shares.  
     The shares of Class B common stock have no right to receive dividends or a distribution on liquidation or winding up of the Company. The shares of Class B common stock do not share in the earnings of the Company and no earnings are allocable to such class. Accordingly, basic and diluted net income per share of Class B common stock have not been presented. 
   
  Note 14   Share-Based and Other Deferred Compensation 
  Equity Grants 
  During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company granted employees   3,087   RSUs that are Service-based Awards. Service-based Awards granted during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   had grant date fair values of   $44.30   to   $51.98   per share. During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   2,269   Service-based Awards vested and   129   Service-based Awards were forfeited.  
  Compensation expense related to Service-based Awards was   $29,505   and   $86,783     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $25,124   and   $80,083     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company's stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2016 Evercore Partners Inc. Stock Incentive Plan. The amended plan, among other things, authorizes an additional   10,000   shares of the Company's Class A Shares. 
  Deferred Cash Program  
  The Company's deferred compensation program provides participants the ability to elect to receive a portion of their deferred compensation in cash, which is indexed to a notional investment portfolio and vests ratably over   four years   and requires payment upon vesting. During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   $41,147   of deferred cash awards pursuant to the deferred compensation program. Compensation expense related to this deferred compensation program was   $4,281   and   $11,399     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $272   and   $1,154     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . 
  Acquisition-related LP Units 
  Equities business   - In conjunction with the acquisition of the operating businesses of International Strategy   Investment ("ISI") in 2014, the Company issued Evercore LP units and interests which have been treated as compensation, including   710   vested Class E LP Units and an allocation of the value, attributed to post-combination service, of   710   Class E LP Units that were unvested and vest ratably on October 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and become exchangeable once vested, subject to continued employment with the Company. The units will become exchangeable into Class A common shares of the Company subject to certain liquidated damages and continued employment provisions. Compensation expense related to Class E LP Units was   $5,133   and   $15,683     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $6,193   and   $16,155     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  .

   (dollars and share / unit amounts in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted) 

In October 2016,   224   Class E LP Units vested. 
  The Company also issued   538   vested and   540   unvested Class G LP Interests, which vest ratably on February 15, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and   2,044   vested and   2,051   unvested Class H LP Interests, which will vest ratably on February 15, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Company s vested Class G and Class H LP Interests will become exchangeable into Class A common shares of the Company subject to the achievement of certain performance targets. The Company s vested Class G LP Interests become exchangeable in February 2016, 2017 and 2018 if certain earnings before interest and taxes, excluding underwriting, ("Management Basis EBIT") margin thresholds within a range of   12%   to   16%  , are achieved for the calendar year preceding the date the interests become exchangeable. The Company s vested Class H LP Interests will become exchangeable in February 2018, 2019 and 2020 if certain average Management Basis EBIT and Management Basis EBIT margin thresholds, within ranges of   $8,000   to   $48,000   and   7%   to   17%  , respectively, are achieved for the   three   calendar years preceding the date the interests become exchangeable. In the event of death, disability or termination of employment without cause, unvested Class G and H LP Interests will be canceled or may vest based on determination of expected performance, based on a decision by Management. 
  In February 2016,   371   Class G LP Interests achieved their performance targets and were converted to the same number of Class E LP Units. 
  Based on Evercore ISI s results for 2015 and for the first nine months of 2016, the Company determined that the achievement of certain of the remaining performance thresholds for the remaining Class G and H LP Interests was probable at   September 30, 2016  . This determination assumes an average Management Basis EBIT margin of   15.9%   and an average annual Management Basis EBIT of   $37,960   being achieved over the remaining performance period for Evercore ISI which would result in   3,721   Class G and H LP Interests vesting and becoming exchangeable into Class E LP Units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had determined that the achievement of certain of the remaining performance thresholds for the Class G and H LP Interests was probable and assumed a Management Basis EBIT margin of   15.7%   and annual Management Basis EBIT of   $34,600   being achieved over the performance period for Evercore ISI. Accordingly,   $8,629   and   $50,379   of expense was recorded   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $15,657   and   $48,970   of expense was recorded   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  , for the Class G and H LP Interests. 
  Assuming the maximum thresholds for the Class G and H LP Interests were considered probable of achievement at September 30, 2016, an additional   $28,300   of expense would have been incurred in the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the remaining expense to be accrued over the future vesting period extending from October 1, 2016 to February 15, 2020 would be   $126,325  . In that circumstance, the total number of Class G and H LP Interests that would vest and become exchangeable to Class E LP Units would be   4,957  . Conversely, the life to date actual accrued expense related to unvested Class G and H LP Interests as of September 30, 2016 was   $91,899  , which would be reversed if the actual performance falls below, or is deemed probable of falling below, the minimum thresholds prior to vesting. 
  Other Acquisition Related 
  Lexicon   - Compensation expense related to The Lexicon Partnership LLP ("Lexicon") Acquisition-related Awards and deferred cash consideration was   $1,237   and   $301  , respectively,   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Long-term Incentive Plan 
  The Company's Long-term Incentive Plan provides for incentive compensation awards to Advisory Senior Managing Directors, excluding executive officers of the Company, who exceed defined benchmark results over a   four  -year performance period beginning January 1, 2013. These awards will be paid, in cash or Class A Shares, at the Company's discretion, in   three   equal installments on January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, to Senior Managing Directors employed by the Company at the time of payment. These awards are subject to retirement eligibility requirements. The Company periodically assesses the probability of the benchmarks being achieved and expenses the probable payout over the requisite service period of the award. The compensation expense related to these awards was   $6,117   and   $13,595     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $1,547   and   $4,590     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . 
  Employee Loans Receivable 
  Periodically, the Company provides new and existing employees with cash payments in the form of loans and/or other cash awards which are subject to ratable vesting terms with service requirements ranging from   one   to   five   years. Generally, the terms of these awards include a requirement of either full or partial repayment of these awards based on the terms of their

In circumstances where the employee meets the Company's minimum credit standards, the Company amortizes these awards to compensation expense over the relevant service period which is generally the period they are subject to forfeiture. Compensation expense related to these awards was   $4,246   and   $14,777     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $3,483   and   $12,434     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  .

In conjunction with these arrangements, the Company distributed cash payments of   $617   and   $2,379     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  , and   $674   and   $2,205     for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  .

  During the first quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the Company entering into a strategic alliance with Luminis Partners ("Luminis"), the Company committed to loan Luminis   $5,500  . The Company paid Luminis   $3,500   pursuant to the loan agreement during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which is included within Other Assets on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition   as of September 30, 2016  , with the remaining   $2,000   due from the Company on demand. The Company may acquire a   20%   interest in Luminis in 2017. 
  In addition, the Company enters into commitments to pay contingent consideration related to certain of its acquisitions. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a remaining commitment for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of Protego in 2006, as well as commitments related to its acquisition of a boutique advisory business in 2014 and its acquisition of Kuna   Co. KG in July 2015.  
  Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, from time to time the Company and its affiliates are involved in judicial or regulatory proceedings, arbitration or mediation concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its businesses, including contractual and employment matters. In addition, Mexican, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canadian and United States government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings regarding the Company s business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or its directors, officers or employees. In view of the inherent difficulty of determining whether any loss in connection with such matters is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot estimate the amount of such loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that it is not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a material effect on the Company. Provisions for losses are established in accordance with ASC 450, "  Contingencies"   when warranted. Once established, such provisions are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.  
  In January 2015, Donna Marie Coburn filed a proposed class action complaint against Evercore Trust Company ("ETC") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in which she purported to represent a class of participants in the J.C. Penney Corporation Inc. Savings, Profit-Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan (the "Plan") whose participant accounts held J.C. Penney stock at any time between May 15, 2012 and the present. The complaint alleged that ETC breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by causing the Plan to invest in J.C. Penney stock during that period and claimed that the Plan suffered losses of approximately   $300 million   due to declines in J.C. Penney stock. ETC believes that it has meritorious defenses against the plaintiff s claims and intends to vigorously defend the action. ETC is indemnified by J.C. Penney, and ultimately the Plan, for reasonable attorneys  fees and other legal expenses, which would be refunded should ETC not prevail. On April 13, 2015, ETC moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and on February 17, 2016, the district court granted ETC s motion to dismiss. On March 15, 2016, plaintiff noticed an appeal of the district court s decision. The case was argued to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on October 13, 2016, and the parties are awaiting a decision.

Item 2. 
    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Evercore Partners Inc. s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook", "believes", "expects", "potential", "probable", "continues", "may", "should", "seeks", "approximately", "predicts", "intends", "plans", "estimates", "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. 
  Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are based on various underlying assumptions and expectations and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, those described under  Risk Factors  discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included or incorporated by reference in this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can management assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
  Key Financial Measures 
  Revenue 
  Total revenues reflect revenues from our Investment Banking and Investment Management business segments that include fees for services, transaction-related client reimbursements plus other revenue. Net revenues reflect total revenues less interest expense. 
  Investment Banking.   Our Investment Banking business earns fees from our clients for providing advice on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, leveraged buyouts, restructurings and similar corporate finance matters, and from underwriting and private placement activities, as well as commissions from our sales and trading activities. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement or services provided. In general, advisory fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter, during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed. The majority of our investment banking revenue consists of advisory fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a transaction. A transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons, including failure of parties to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals, to secure necessary financing or to achieve necessary regulatory approvals. In the case of bankruptcy engagements, fees are subject to approval of the court. Underwriting fees are recognized when the offering has been deemed to be completed, placement fees are generally recognized at the time of the client s acceptance of capital or capital commitments. Commissions and Related Fees includes commissions, which are recorded on a trade-date basis or, in the case of payments under commission sharing arrangements, on the date earned. Commissions and Related Fees also include subscription fees for the sales of research. Cash received before the subscription period ends is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the remaining subscription period.  
  Revenue trends in our advisory business generally are correlated to the volume of merger and acquisition ("M A") activity and/or restructuring activity, which tends to be counter-cyclical to M A. However, deviations from this trend can occur in any given year or quarter for a number of reasons. For example, changes in our market share or the ability of our clients to close certain large transactions can cause our revenue results to diverge from the level of overall M A or restructuring activity. Revenue trends in our equities business are correlated to market volumes, which generally decrease in periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions.

     Table of Contents                                                       

Investment Management.   Our Investment Management business includes operations related to the management of the Institutional Asset Management, Wealth Management and Private Equity businesses. Revenue sources primarily include management fees, which include fees earned from portfolio companies, fiduciary and consulting fees, performance fees (including carried interest) and gains (or losses) on our investments. 
  Management fees for third party clients generally represent a percentage of assets under management ("AUM"). Fiduciary and consulting fees, which are generally a function of the size and complexity of each engagement, are individually negotiated. Management fees from private equity operations are generally a percentage of committed capital or invested capital at rates agreed with the investment funds we manage or with the individual client. The Company records performance fees upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable. Portfolio company fees include monitoring, director and transaction fees associated with services provided to the portfolio companies of the private equity funds we manage. Gains and losses include both realized and unrealized gains and losses on principal investments, including those arising from our equity interest in investment partnerships. 
  Transaction-Related Client Reimbursements  . In both our Investment Banking and Investment Management segments, we make various transaction-related expenditures, such as travel and professional fees, on behalf of our clients. Pursuant to the engagement letters with our advisory clients or the contracts with the limited partners in the private equity funds we manage, these expenditures may be reimbursable. We define these expenses as transaction-related expenses and record such expenditures as incurred and record revenue when it is determined that clients have an obligation to reimburse us for such transaction-related expenses. Client expense reimbursements are recorded as revenue on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   on the later of the date an engagement letter is executed or the date we pay or accrue the expense. 
  Other Revenue and Interest Expense.   Other revenue and interest expense is derived from investing customer funds in financing transactions. These transactions are principally repurchases and resales of Mexican government and government agency securities. Revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction.  
  Other Revenue also includes income earned on marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents and assets segregated for regulatory purposes, as well as adjustments to amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreements, subsequent to its initial establishment, related to changes in state and local tax rates and gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency fluctuations.  
  Interest Expense also includes interest expense associated with our Notes Payable, subordinated borrowings and the line of credit. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense.   We include all payments for services rendered by our employees, as well as profits interests in our businesses that have been accounted for as compensation, in employee compensation and benefits expense. 
  We maintain compensation programs, including base salary, cash, deferred cash and equity bonus awards and benefits programs and manage compensation to estimates of competitive levels based on market conditions and performance. Our level of compensation reflects our plan to maintain competitive compensation levels to retain key personnel, and it reflects the impact of newly-hired senior professionals, including related grants of equity awards which are generally valued at their grant date. 
  Increasing the number of high-caliber, experienced senior level employees is critical to our growth efforts. In our advisory businesses, these hires generally do not begin to generate significant revenue in the year they are hired. 
  Our annual compensation program includes share-based compensation awards and deferred cash awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain employees. These awards are generally subject to annual vesting requirements over a four-year period beginning at the date of grant, which occurs in the first quarter of each year; accordingly, the expense is generally amortized over the stated vesting period, subject to retirement eligibility. With respect to annual awards, the Company's retirement eligibility criteria stipulates that if an employee has at least five years of continuous service, is at least 55 years of age and has a combined age and years of service of at least 65 years, the employee is eligible for retirement. Retirement eligibility allows for continued vesting of awards after employees depart from the Company, provided they give the minimum advance notice, which is generally one year.

     Table of Contents                                                       

Non-Compensation Expenses.   The balance of our operating expenses includes costs for occupancy and equipment rental, professional fees, travel and related expenses, communications and information technology services, depreciation and amortization, acquisition and transition costs and other operating expenses. We refer to all of these expenses as non-compensation expenses. 
  Other Expenses 
  Other Expenses include the following: 
             
    Amortization of LP Units/Interests and Certain Other Awards   - Includes amortization costs associated with the vesting of Class E LP Units and Class G and H LP Interests issued in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI and certain other related awards.   
                
    Other Acquisition Related Compensation Charges   - Includes compensation charges in 2015 associated with deferred consideration, retention awards and related compensation for Lexicon employees. 
                
    Special Charges   - Includes expenses in 2015 primarily related to an impairment charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Institutional Asset Management reporting unit, separation benefits and costs associated with the termination of certain contracts within the Company s Evercore ISI business and the finalization of a matter associated with the wind-down of the Company s U.S. Private Equity business. 
                
    Acquisition and Transition Costs   - Includes costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and other ongoing business development initiatives, primarily comprised of professional fees for legal and other services, as well as the reversal of a provision for certain settlements in 2016 previously established in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
                
    Fair Value of Contingent Consideration   - Includes expense associated with changes in the fair value of contingent consideration issued to the sellers of certain of the Company s acquisitions. 
                
    Intangible Asset and Other Amortization   - Includes amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting-related amortization associated with certain acquisitions. 
     Income from Equity Method Investments 
  Our share of the income (loss) from our equity interests in G5   Evercore, ABS and Atalanta Sosnoff (after its deconsolidation on December 31, 2015) are included within Income from Equity Method Investments, as a component of Income Before Income Taxes, on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  .  
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "  Income Taxes"   ("ASC 740"), which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. 
  Noncontrolling Interest 
  We record noncontrolling interest relating to the ownership interests of our current and former Senior Managing Directors and other officers and their estate planning vehicles in Evercore LP, as well as the portions of our operating subsidiaries not owned by Evercore. As described in Note 12 to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   herein, Evercore Partners Inc. is the sole general partner of Evercore LP and has a majority economic interest in Evercore LP. As a result, Evercore Partners Inc. consolidates Evercore LP and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in Evercore LP held by the limited partners. 
  We generally allocate net income or loss to noncontrolling interests held at Evercore LP and at the operating entity level, where required, by multiplying the relative ownership interest of the noncontrolling interest holders for the period by the net income or loss of the entity to which the noncontrolling interest relates. In circumstances where the governing documents of the entity to which the noncontrolling interest relates require special allocations of profits or losses to the controlling and noncontrolling interest holders, then the net income or loss of these entities will be allocated based on these special allocations.

Results of Operations 
  The following is a discussion of our results of operations   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the revenue and operating expenses of our Investment Banking and Investment Management business segments in these periods, see the discussion in "Business Segments" below. 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   we employed approximately 1,500 and 1,400 people, respectively, worldwide. 
  Three Months Ended September 30,     2016     versus   September 30,     2015    
  Net Revenues were   $386.3 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $77.4 million  , or   25%  , versus Net Revenues of   $309.0 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Investment Banking Revenue increased   29%   and Investment Management Revenue decreased   28%   compared to the   three months ended September 30,   2015. On December 31, 2015, we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of Atalanta Sosnoff and we accounted for our interest as an equity method investment from that date forward. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the results of Atalanta Sosnoff were consolidated, which included Net Revenues of $5.4 million and Total Expenses of $5.1 million. Other Revenue for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   34%   compared to the   three months ended September 30,   2015, which was partially attributable to a gain resulting from the transfer of ownership of the Mexican Private Equity business on September 30, 2016. 
  Total Operating Expenses were   $283.5 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $238.8 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $44.7 million   or   19%  . Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense, as a component of Operating Expenses, was $217.8 million for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of $42.4 million, or   24%  , versus expense of   $175.4 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs resulting from the expansion of our businesses, including costs from share-based and other deferred and incentive compensation arrangements. Headcount increased 7% from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Non-compensation expenses as a component of Operating Expenses were   $65.7 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of $2.3 million, or 4%, over non-compensation operating expenses of

     Table of Contents                                                       

$63.4 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Non-compensation operating expenses increased compared to the   three months ended September 30,   2015 primarily driven by increased headcount and higher professional fees. 
  Total Other Expenses of   $17.7 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of   $13.9 million  , primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, Acquisition and Transition Costs of   $0.3 million  , changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of   $1.0 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of   $2.5 million  . Total Other Expenses of   $58.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30,   2015 included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of   $22.0 million  , primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, Special Charges   $28.0 million  , related to an impairment charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Institutional Asset Management reporting unit, Acquisition and Transition Costs of   $0.5 million  , changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of   $2.8 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of $4.9 million. 
  Assuming the maximum thresholds for the Class G and H LP Interests were considered probable of achievement at September 30, 2016, an additional   $28.3 million   of expense would have been incurred in the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the remaining expense to be accrued over the future vesting period extending from October 1, 2016 to February 15, 2020 would be   $126.3 million  . In that circumstance, the total number of Class G and H LP Interests that would vest and become exchangeable to Class E LP Units would be   5.0 million  . Conversely, the life to date actual accrued expense related to unvested Class G and H LP Interests as of September 30, 2016 was   $91.9 million  , which would be reversed if the actual performance falls below the minimum thresholds prior to vesting. 
  As a result of the factors noted above, Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense as a percentage of Net Revenues was   60%   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   64%   for the   three months ended September 30,   2015. 
  Income from Equity Method Investments was   $1.2 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   27%   as compared to   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30,   2015. The increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of Atalanta Sosnoff's earnings in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from ABS. 
  The provision for income taxes for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $39.0 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   45%  . The provision for income taxes for the   three months ended September 30,   2015 was   $7.4 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   58%  . The provision for income taxes for 2016 and 2015 reflects the effect of certain nondeductible expenses, including expenses related to Class E LP Units and Class G and H LP Interests, as well as the noncontrolling interest associated with LP Units and other adjustments. 
  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest was   $12.6 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   ($1.8) million   for the   three months ended September 30,   2015. The increase in Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest reflects higher income allocated to Evercore LP during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as well as the impact of the impairment of goodwill in the Institutional Asset Management reporting unit incurred in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015    
  Net Revenues were   $994.7 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $179.7 million  , or   22%  , versus Net Revenues of   $815.0 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Investment Banking Revenue increased   25%   and Investment Management Revenue decreased   18%   compared to   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . For   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the results of Atalanta Sosnoff were consolidated, which included Net Revenues of $16.7 million and Total Expenses of $15.6 million. Other Revenue   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   46%   higher than   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was partially attributable to a gain resulting from the transfer of ownership of the Mexican Private Equity business on September 30, 2016, as well as foreign currency gains resulting from currency fluctuations following the Brexit vote in June 2016. 
  Total Operating Expenses were   $754.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $644.3 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $110.0 million  , or   17%  . Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense, as a component of Operating Expenses, was   $566.6 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $100.6 million  , or   22%  , versus expense of   $466.0 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs resulting from the expansion of our businesses, including costs from share-based and other deferred and incentive compensation arrangements. Non-compensation expenses as a component of Operating Expenses were   $187.6 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $9.3 million  , or   5%  , over non-compensation operating expenses of   $178.3 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Non-compensation operating expenses increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily driven by

increased headcount, increased new business costs associated with higher levels of global transaction activity and higher professional fees. 
  Total Other Expenses of   $76.7 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of   $66.4 million  , primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, Acquisition and Transition Costs of $0.01 million, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of   $1.7 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of   $8.6 million  . Total Other Expenses of $116.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of $66.1 million, primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, other acquisition related compensation costs of $1.5 million, Special Charges of $33.5 million, primarily related to an impairment charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Institutional Asset Management reporting unit, Acquisition and Transition Costs of $1.9 million, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of $2.8 million and intangible asset and other amortization of $10.9 million. 
  As a result of the factors noted above, Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense as a percentage of Net Revenues was   64%     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   65%     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Income from Equity Method Investments was   $4.1 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $4.0 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of Atalanta Sosnoff's earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from ABS and G5 | Evercore. 
  The provision for income taxes   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $79.4 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   47%  . The provision for income taxes   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $30.3 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   52%  .  The provision for income taxes for 2016 and 2015 reflects the effect of certain nondeductible expenses, including expenses related to Class E LP Units and Class G and H LP Interests in 2016, as well as the noncontrolling interest associated with LP Units and other adjustments. 
  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest was   $24.5 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.5 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest reflects higher income allocated to Evercore LP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as well as the impact of the impairment of goodwill in the Institutional Asset Management reporting unit incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

     Investment Banking Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended September 30,     2016   versus   September 30,     2015    
  Net Investment Banking Revenues were   $368.6 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $285.9 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , which represented an increase of   29%  . We earned advisory fees from   211   client transactions for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   168     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , representing a   26%   increase. We had   65   fees in excess of $1.0 million for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   35     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , representing a   86%   increase. The increase in revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects an increase of   $84.2 million  , or   38%  , in Advisory Fees, principally driven by higher volume and value of deals in our U.S. business reflecting increased market share, and an increase of   $3.4 million  , or   76%  , in Underwriting Fees, principally driven by higher volume in our U.S. and Mexico businesses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of   $4.8 million  , or   8%  , in our Commissions and Related Fees, principally driven by lower trading volumes at Evercore ISI compared to the comparable period in the prior year which experienced high volatility in the U.S. equity markets and therefore, higher volumes. 
  Operating Expenses were   $268.7 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $220.6 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $48.1 million  , or   22%  . Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense, as a component of Operating Expenses, was $207.6 million for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $162.4 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of $45.2 million, or   28%  . The increase was primarily due to compensation costs resulting from the expansion of our businesses, including costs from share-based and other deferred and incentive compensation arrangements, as well as increased incentive compensation related to the   29%   increase in Net Revenues. Non-compensation expenses, as a component of Operating Expenses, were   $61.1 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $58.2 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of $2.9 million, or   5%  . Non-compensation operating expenses increased from the prior year primarily driven by increased headcount within the business and higher professional fees. 
  Other Expenses of   $17.4 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of   $13.9 million  , primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, Acquisition and Transition Costs of   $0.04 million  , changes to the

fair value of contingent consideration of   $1.0 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of   $2.5 million  . Other Expenses of   $30.1 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of   $22.0 million  , primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, Acquisition and Transition Costs of   $0.5 million  , changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of   $2.8 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of   $4.8 million  .  
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015    
  Net Investment Banking Revenues were   $936.5 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $746.9 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represented an increase of   25%  . We earned advisory fees from   418   clients   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   354     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , representing a   18%   increase. We had   164   fees in excess of $1.0 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   112     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , representing a   46%   increase. The increase in revenues from   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily reflects an increase of   $190.0 million  , or   34%  , in Advisory fees, principally driven by higher volume and value of deals in our U.S. and U.K. businesses reflecting increased market share, and an increase of   $3.5 million  , or   2%  , in our Commissions and Related Fees, principally driven by higher trading volumes at Evercore ISI. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of   $7.0 million  , or   22%  , in Underwriting Fees, principally related to market conditions during 2016. 
  Operating Expenses were   $707.8 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $586.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $121.6 million  , or   21%  . Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense, as a component of Operating Expenses, was $533.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $425.0 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $108.6 million  , or   26%  . The increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs resulting from the expansion of our businesses, including costs from share-based and other deferred and incentive compensation arrangements, as well as increased incentive compensation related to the   25%   increase in Net Revenues. Non-compensation expenses, as a component of Operating Expenses, were   $174.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $161.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $13.0 million  , or   8%  . Non-compensation operating expenses increased from the prior year primarily driven by increased headcount within the business, increased new business costs associated with higher levels of global transaction activity and higher professional fees. 
  Other Expenses of   $75.9 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of   $66.4 million  , primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, Acquisition and Transition Costs of   ($0.7) million  , primarily reflecting the reversal of a provision for certain settlements in 2016 previously established in the fourth quarter of 2015, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of   $1.7 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of   $8.5 million  . Other Expenses of $85.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   included compensation costs associated with the vesting of LP Units and Interests and certain other awards of $66.1 million, primarily related to Evercore LP Units and Interests granted in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, other acquisition related compensation costs of $1.5 million, Special Charges of $2.2 million, Acquisition and Transition Costs of $1.9 million, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of $2.8 million and intangible asset and other amortization of $10.6 million.

Investment Management 
  The following table summarizes the operating results of the Investment Management segment.

    Includes an impairment charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Institutional Asset Management reporting unit of $28.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

    Equity in G5   Evercore, ABS and Atalanta Sosnoff (after its deconsolidation on December 31, 2015) is classified as Income from Equity Method Investments.  
     Investment Management Results of Operations 
  Our Wealth Management business includes the results of EWM. Our Institutional Asset Management business includes the results of ETC, ECB and Atalanta Sosnoff (prior to its deconsolidation on December 31, 2015). Fee-based revenues from EWM, Atalanta Sosnoff and ECB are primarily earned on a percentage of AUM, while ETC primarily earns fees from negotiated trust services and fiduciary consulting arrangements.  
  On July 19, 2016, the Company and the principals of its Mexican Private Equity business entered into an agreement to transfer ownership of its Mexican Private Equity business and related entities to Glisco. This transaction closed on September 30, 2016. See Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
  Prior to the Glisco transaction, we earned management fees on GMCP II and GMCP III of 2.25% and 2.0%, respectively, per annum of committed capital during its investment period, and 2.25% and 2.0%, respectively, per annum on net

funded capital thereafter. In addition, the general partner of the private equity funds earns carried interest of 20% based on the fund s performance, provided it exceeds preferred return hurdles to its limited partners. We owned 8%-9% of the carried interest earned by the general partner of ECP II up until the fund's termination on December 31, 2014. A significant portion of any gains recognized related to ECP II, GMCP II and GMCP III, and any carried interest recognized by them, are distributed to certain of our private equity professionals. 
  In the event the private equity funds perform below certain thresholds we may be obligated to repay certain carried interest previously distributed. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.4   million of previously distributed carried interest that may be subject to repayment. 
  We made investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in G5   Evercore and ABS during the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011, respectively, the results of which are included within Income from Equity Method Investments. On December 31, 2015, we amended the Operating Agreement of Atalanta Sosnoff, resulting in the deconsolidation of its assets and liabilities, and we accounted for its interest as an equity method investment from that date forward.  
  Assets Under Management 
  AUM for our Investment Management businesses of   $8.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   increased compared to   $8.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The amounts of AUM presented in the table below reflect the assets for which we charge a management fee. These assets reflect the fair value of assets managed on behalf of Institutional Asset Management and Wealth Management clients, and the amount of either the invested or committed capital of the Private Equity funds. As defined in ASC 820,   "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"   ("ASC 820"), valuations performed for Level I investments are based on quoted prices obtained from active markets generated by third parties and Level II investments are valued through the use of models based on either direct or indirect observable inputs in the use of models or other valuation methodologies performed by third parties to determine fair value. For both the Level I and Level II investments, we obtain both active quotes from nationally recognized exchanges and third-party pricing services to determine market or fair value quotes, respectively. For Level III investments, pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Wealth Management maintained 63% of Level I investments, 34% of Level II investments and 3% of Level III investments as of   September 30, 2016   and 66% of Level I investments and 34% of Level II investments as of   December 31, 2015  . Institutional Asset Management maintained 83% and 87% of Level I investments and 17% and 13% of Level II investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As noted above, Private Equity AUM is not presented at fair value, but reported at either invested or committed capital in line with fee arrangements.  
  The fees that we receive for providing investment advisory and management services are primarily driven by the level and composition of AUM. Accordingly, client flows, market movements, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in our product mix will impact the level of management fees we receive from our investment management businesses. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the channel in which they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets, alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products. Clients will increase or reduce the aggregate amount of AUM that we manage for a number of reasons, including changes in the level of assets that they have available for investment purposes, their overall asset allocation strategy, our relative performance versus competitors offering similar investment products and the quality of our service. The fees we earn are also impacted by our investment performance, as the appreciation or depreciation in the value of the assets that we manage directly impacts our fees.

The following table represents the composition of our AUM for Wealth Management and Institutional Asset Management as of   September 30, 2016  : 
   
 (1)  Includes cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury securities. 
  Our Wealth Management business serves individuals, families and related institutions delivering customized investment management, financial planning, and trust and custody services. Investment portfolios are tailored to meet the investment objectives of individual clients and reflect a blend of equity, fixed income and other products. Fees charged to clients reflect the composition of the assets managed and the services provided. Investment performance in the Wealth Management businesses is measured against appropriate indices based on the AUM, most frequently the S P 500 and a composite fixed income index principally reflecting BarCap and MSCI indices. 
  For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , AUM for Wealth Management increased   5%  , reflecting a   2%   increase due to flows and a   3%   increase due to market appreciation. Wealth Management lagged the S P 500 on a 1 and 3 year basis by 9% and 1%, respectively, during the period and outperformed the fixed income composite on a 1 and 3 year basis by 60 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. For the period, the S P 500 was up 8%, while the fixed income composite increased by 3%. 
  Our Institutional Asset Management business reflects assets managed by ECB. ECB primarily manages Mexican Government and corporate fixed income securities. ECB also manages equity products. ECB utilizes the IPC Index, which is a capitalization weighted index of leading equities traded on the Mexican Stock Exchange and the Cetes 28 Index, which is an index of Treasury Bills issued by the Mexican Government, as benchmarks in reviewing their performance and managing their investment decisions. For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , AUM for Institutional Asset Management increased   12%  , reflecting a 29% increase due to flows, partially offset by a   17%   decrease due to market depreciation. ECB's AUM increase primarily reflects net inflows, partially offset by the impact of the fluctuation of foreign currency. 
  Our Private Equity business included the assets of funds which our Private Equity professionals managed. These funds included ECP II (terminated on December 31, 2014), and the Discovery Fund, GMCP II and GMCP III prior to the closing of the Glisco transaction on September 30, 2016. See Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
  AUM from our unconsolidated affiliates decreased   1%   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily related to negative performance in Atalanta Sosnoff and ABS.

Three Months Ended September 30,     2016   versus   September 30, 2015    
  Net Investment Management Revenues were   $17.7 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $23.0 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Investment Advisory and Management Fees earned from the management of client portfolios and other investment advisory services decreased   24%   from   the three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily reflecting a decrease in Institutional Asset Management fees related to our deconsolidation of Atalanta Sosnoff (which reflected revenue of $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015), partially offset by higher fees in Wealth Management of   $0.7 million   related to growth in AUM. Fee-based revenues included $0.04 million of revenues from performance fees for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to $0.01 million of revenues from performance fees during   the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Realized and Unrealized Gains decreased   63%   from the prior year primarily resulting from lower gains in our private equity funds, partially offset by higher gains in Institutional Asset Management. Income from Equity Method Investments decreased from   the three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of a decrease in earnings from our investments in ABS and G5 | Evercore, partially offset by the inclusion of Atalanta Sosnoff s earnings in the third quarter of 2016. 
  Operating Expenses were   $14.8 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $18.3 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of $3.4 million, or   19%  , primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of Atalanta Sosnoff (which reflected expenses of $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015). Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense, as a component of Operating Expenses, was   $10.3 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to $13.0 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $2.7 million  , or   21%  . Non-compensation expenses, as a component of Operating Expenses, were   $4.5 million  , as compared to   $5.3 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $0.8 million  , or 15%.   
  Other Expenses of   $0.3 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016   were related to Acquisition and Transition Costs. Other Expenses of   $28.1 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily included Special Charges of $28.0 million related to an impairment charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Institutional Asset Management reporting unit.  
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015    
  Net Investment Management Revenues were   $58.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $68.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Investment Advisory and Management Fees earned from the management of client portfolios and other investment advisory services decreased   24%   from   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily reflecting a decrease in Institutional Asset Management fees related to our deconsolidation of Atalanta Sosnoff (which reflected Net Revenues of $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015), partially offset by higher fees in Wealth Management of   $1.4 million   related to growth in AUM. Fee-based revenues included $0.2 million of revenues from performance fees during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $0.4 million during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Realized and Unrealized Gains increased   49%   from the prior year primarily resulting from higher gains and performance fees in our private equity funds. Income from Equity Method Investments increased from   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of the inclusion of Atalanta Sosnoff's earnings in 2016. 
  Operating Expenses were   $46.4 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $58.1 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $11.7 million  , or   20%  , primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of Atalanta Sosnoff (which reflected expenses of $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015). Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense, as a component of Operating Expenses, was $33.0 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $41.0 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $8.0 million  , or   20%  . Non-compensation expenses, as a component of Operating Expenses, were   $13.4 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $17.1 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $3.7 million  , or   22%  .   
  Other Expenses of   $0.8 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   included Acquisition and Transition Costs of   $0.7 million   and intangible asset and other amortization of   $0.1 million  . Other Expenses of   $31.6 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily included Special Charges of $31.3 million, primarily related to an impairment charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Institutional Asset Management reporting unit.  
  Cash Flows 
  Our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the timing and receipt of investment banking and investment management fees, and the payment of operating expenses, including bonuses to our employees and interest expense on our repurchase agreements, Notes Payable, subordinated borrowings and the line of credit. Investment Banking advisory fees are generally collected within 90 days of billing. However, placement fees may be collected within 180 days of billing, with certain

fees being collected in a period exceeding one year. Commissions earned from our agency trading activities are generally received from our clearing broker within 11 days. Fees from our Wealth Management and Institutional Asset Management businesses are generally billed and collected within 90 days. We traditionally pay a substantial portion of incentive compensation to personnel in the Investment Banking business and to executive officers during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results. Our investing and financing cash flows are primarily influenced by activities to deploy capital to fund investments and acquisitions, raise capital through the issuance of stock or debt, repurchase of outstanding Class A Shares, and/or noncontrolling interest in Evercore LP, as well as our other subsidiaries, payment of dividends and other periodic distributions to our stakeholders. We generally make dividend payments and other distributions on a quarterly basis. We periodically draw down on our line of credit to balance the timing of our operating, investing and financing cash flow needs. A summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended     September 30,     2016  .   Cash and Cash Equivalents were   $446.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.7 million   versus Cash and Cash Equivalents of   $448.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of   $245.9 million  , primarily related to earnings, partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. Cash of   $41.6 million   was used in investing activities primarily related to net purchases of our marketable securities, purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and an increase in restricted cash. Financing activities during the period used cash of   $189.2 million  , primarily for the payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, treasury stock purchases and the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility with Mizuho, partially offset by the issuance of the Private Placement Notes. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30,     2015  .   Cash and Cash Equivalents were $278.1 million at September 30, 2015, a decrease of $74.0 million versus Cash and Cash Equivalents of $352.2 million at December 31, 2014. Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of $142.8 million, primarily related to earnings, partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. Cash of $18.7 million was used in investing activities primarily related to purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by distributions from private equity investments. Financing activities during the period used cash of $191.4 million, primarily for the payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, as well as treasury stock purchases. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
  Our current assets include Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Accounts Receivable relating to Investment Banking and Investment Management revenues. Our current liabilities include accrued expenses, accrued employee compensation and short-term borrowings. We traditionally have made payments for employee bonus awards and year-end distributions to partners in the first quarter of the year with respect to the prior year s results. From time to time, advances may also be made in satisfaction of commitments to new employees, at or near the date they begin employment. Cash distributions related to partnership tax allocations are made to the partners of Evercore LP and EWM in accordance with our corporate estimated payment calendar; these payments are made prior to the end of each calendar quarter. In addition, dividends on

     Table of Contents                                                       

Class A Shares, and related distributions to partners of Evercore LP, are paid when and if declared by the Board of Directors, which is generally quarterly. 
  We regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash, other significant working capital, current assets and liabilities, long-term liabilities, lease commitments and related fixed assets, principal investment commitments related to our Investment Management business, dividends on Class A Shares, partnership distributions and other capital transactions, as well as other matters relating to liquidity and compliance with regulatory requirements. Our liquidity is highly dependent on our revenue stream from our operations, principally from our Investment Banking business, which is a function of closing transactions and earning success fees, the timing and realization of which is irregular and dependent upon factors that are not subject to our control. Our revenue stream funds the payment of our expenses, including annual bonus payments, a portion of which are guaranteed, interest expense on our repurchase agreements, Notes Payable, subordinated borrowings and the line of credit and other financing arrangements and income taxes. Payments made for income taxes may be reduced by deductions taken for the increase in tax basis of our investment in Evercore LP. These tax deductions, when realized, require payment under our long-term liability, Amounts Due Pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreements. We intend to fund these payments from cash and cash equivalents on hand, principally derived from cash flows from operations. These tax deductions, when realized, will result in cash otherwise required to satisfy tax obligations becoming available for other purposes. Our Management Committee meets regularly to monitor our liquidity and cash positions against our short and long-term obligations, as well as our capital requirements and commitments. The result of this review contributes to management s recommendation to the Board of Directors as to the level of quarterly dividend payments, if any. 
  As a financial services firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. Revenue generated by our advisory activities is related to the number and value of the transactions in which we are involved. In addition, revenue related to our equities business is driven by market volumes. During periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the number and value of M A transactions, as well as market volumes in equities, generally decrease, and they generally increase during periods of favorable market or economic conditions. Restructuring activity generally is counter-cyclical to M A activity. In addition, during periods of unfavorable market conditions our Investment Management business may be impacted by reduced equity valuations and generate relatively lower revenue because fees we receive, either directly or through our affiliates, typically are in part based on the market value of underlying publicly-traded securities. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame and in an amount sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions. Reduced equity valuations resulting from future adverse economic events and/or market conditions may impact our performance and may result in future net redemptions of AUM from our clients, which would generally result in lower revenues and cash flows. These adverse conditions could also have an impact on our goodwill impairment assessment, which is done annually, as of November 30th, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  
  The recent market turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote in the U.K. may have a negative impact on our business operations in the U.K., and globally, over the intermediate term. We will continue to monitor and manage the potential implications of the Brexit vote, including assessing opportunities that may arise, as the potential impact on the U.K. and European economy becomes more evident.   
  The Company assesses its equity method investments for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. These circumstances could include unfavorable market conditions or the loss of key personnel of the investee. 
  For a further discussion of risks related to our business, refer to "Risk Factors" in Item 1A. and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Stock Incentive Plan 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company's stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2016 Evercore Partners Inc. Stock Incentive Plan. The amended plan, among other things, authorizes an additional 10.0 million shares of the Company's Class A Shares. 
  Treasury and Noncontrolling Interest Repurchases 
  We periodically repurchase Class A Shares and/or LP Units into Treasury in order to reduce the dilutive effect of equity awards granted. In addition, we may from time to time, purchase noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. 
  
   47 

     Table of Contents                                                       

In October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of additional Class A Shares and/or LP Units so that going forward Evercore will be able to repurchase an aggregate of seven million Class A Shares and/or LP Units for up to $350.0 million. On April 25, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of additional Class A Shares and/or LP Units so that going forward Evercore will be able to repurchase an aggregate of 7.5 million Class A Shares and/or LP Units for up to $450.0 million. Under this share repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual amount of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, economic and market conditions and the objective to reduce the dilutive effect of equity awards granted. This program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased 2,402,904 shares, at an average cost per share of $48.22, for $115.8 million pursuant to our repurchase program. 
  In addition, periodically, we buy shares into treasury from our employees in order to allow them to satisfy their minimum tax requirements for share deliveries under our share equity plan. During   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased 998,786 shares, at an average cost per share of $46.04 for $46.0 million primarily related to minimum tax withholding requirements of share deliveries. 
  On January 29, 2016, we purchased, at fair value, all of the noncontrolling interest in ECB for $6.5 million. 
  Private Placement 
  On March 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate $170.0 million of senior notes, including: $38.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.88% Series A Notes due 2021, $67.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.23% Series B Notes due 2023, $48.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.48% Series C Notes due 2026 and $17.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.58% Series D Notes due 2028, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement dated as of March 30, 2016, among the Company and the purchasers party thereto in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.  
  Interest on the Private Placement Notes is payable semi-annually and the Private Placement Notes are guaranteed by certain of the Company's material domestic subsidiaries. The Company may, at its option, prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the Private Placement Notes (without regard to Series), in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Private Placement Notes then outstanding at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus an applicable "make-whole amount." Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the holders of the Private Placement Notes will have the right to require the Company to prepay the entire unpaid principal amounts held by each holder of the Private Placement Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary covenants, including financial covenants requiring compliance with a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum interest coverage ratio, and customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants. 
  The Company used $120.0 million of the net proceeds from the Private Placement Notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility with Mizuho on March 30, 2016 and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
  Lines of Credit 
  On June 26, 2015, East, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, increased its line of credit from First Republic Bank to an aggregate principal amount of up to   $75.0 million  , to be used for working capital and other corporate activities, including, but not limited to, the repurchase of the Company's stock from time to time. This facility is secured by (i) cash and cash equivalents of East held in a designated account with First Republic Bank, (ii) certain of East's intercompany receivables and (iii) third party accounts receivable of EGL. Drawings under this facility bear interest at the prime rate. The facility was renewed on June 26, 2015 and the maturity date was extended to   June 27, 2016  . On January 15, 2016, the line of credit from First Republic Bank was decreased to an aggregate principal amount of up to   $50.0 million  . In addition, the agreement was modified to impose similar quarterly financial covenants as the Company agreed to in the senior credit facility with Mizuho executed in November 2015, including (i) a Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, (ii) a Minimum Unencumbered Liquid Asset Ratio and (iii) a Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio. On January 27, 2016, East drew down   $50.0 million   on this facility. East repaid and terminated its line of credit with First Republic Bank on June 23, 2016. 
  On June 24, 2016, East entered into a loan agreement with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC") for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $30.0 million  , to be used for working capital and other corporate activities. This facility is secured by East's accounts receivable and the proceeds therefrom, as well as certain assets of EGLs,  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents                                                       

including certain of EGL's accounts receivable. In addition, the agreement contains certain reporting covenants as well as certain debt covenants that prohibit East and the Company from incurring other indebtedness subject to specified exceptions. Drawings under this facility bear interest at the prime rate. The facility matures on June 23, 2017, subject to an extension agreed to between East and PNC. There have been no monies drawn on this facility as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  ECB maintains a line of credit with BBVA Bancomer to fund its trading activities on an intra-day and overnight basis. The facility has a maximum aggregate principal amount of approximately $10.3 million and is secured by trading securities. No interest is charged on the intra-day facility. The overnight facility is charged the Inter-Bank Balance Interest Rate plus 10 basis points. There have been no significant draw downs on ECB s line of credit since August 10, 2006. The line of credit is renewable annually. 
  Other Commitments 
  The Company has subordinated borrowings, principally with an executive officer of the Company, due on October 31, 2019. These borrowings have a coupon of 5.5%, payable semi-annually. In April 2016, the Company repaid $6.0 million of the original borrowings pursuant to a separate agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $16.6 million in subordinated borrowings pursuant to these agreements. 
  We have made certain capital commitments with respect to our investment activities, as well as commitments related to contingent consideration from our acquisitions, which are included in the Contractual Obligations section below. 
  During the first quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the Company entering into a strategic alliance with Luminis, the Company committed to loan Luminis $5.5 million. The Company paid Luminis $3.5 million pursuant to the loan agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, with the remaining $2.0 million due from the Company on demand. The Company may acquire a 20% interest in Luminis in 2017. 
  Pursuant to deferred compensation and deferred consideration arrangements, we are obligated to make cash payments in future periods. For further information see Note 14 to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
  Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated entities and are subject to capital requirements. For further information see Note 16 to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
  Collateralized Financing Activity at ECB 
  ECB enters into repurchase agreements with clients seeking overnight money market returns whereby ECB transfers to the clients Mexican government securities in exchange for cash and concurrently agrees to repurchase the securities at a future date for an amount equal to the cash exchanged plus a stipulated premium or interest factor. ECB deploys the cash received from, and acquires the securities deliverable to, clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market or by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties. We account for these repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing transactions. We record a liability on our   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition   in relation to repurchase transactions executed with clients as Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase. We record as assets on our   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition  , Financial Instruments Owned and Pledged as Collateral at Fair Value (where we have acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market) and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell (where we have acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase agreements by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties). These Mexican government securities included in Financial Instruments Owned and Pledged as Collateral at Fair Value on the   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition   have an estimated average time to maturity of approximately   1.6 years  , as of   September 30, 2016  , and are pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements, which are collateralized financing agreements. Generally, collateral is posted equal to the contract value at inception and is subject to market changes. These repurchase agreements are primarily with institutional customer accounts managed by ECB, generally mature within one business day and permit the counterparty to pledge the securities. Increases and decreases in asset and liability levels related to these transactions are a function of growth in ECB s AUM, as well as clients  investment allocations requiring positioning in repurchase transactions. 
  ECB has procedures in place to monitor the daily risk limits for positions taken, as well as the credit risk based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against their contract value from inception to maturity date. The daily risk measure is VaR, which is a statistical measure, at a 98% confidence level, of the potential daily losses from adverse market movements in an ordinary market environment based on a historical simulation using the prior year s historical data. ECB s Risk Management  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents                                                       

Committee has established a policy to maintain VaR at levels below 0.1% of the value of the portfolio. If at any point in time the threshold is exceeded, ECB personnel are alerted by an automated interface with ECB s trading systems and begin to make adjustments in the portfolio in order to mitigate the risk and bring the portfolio in compliance. Concurrently, ECB personnel must notify the Committee of the variance and the actions taken to reduce the exposure to loss. 
  In addition to monitoring VaR, ECB periodically performs discrete stress tests ("Stress Tests") to assure that the level of potential losses that would arise from extreme market movements that may not be anticipated by VaR measures are within acceptable levels. The table below includes a key stress test monitored by the Committee, noted as the sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in interest rates. This analysis assists ECB in understanding the impact of an extreme move in rates, assuring the Collateralized Financing portfolio is structured to maintain risk at an acceptable level, even in extreme circumstances. 
  The Committee meets monthly to analyze the overall market risk exposure based on positions taken, as well as the credit risk, based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against the contract value from inception to maturity date. In these meetings the Committee evaluates risk from an operating perspective, VaR, and an exceptional perspective, Stress Tests, to determine the appropriate level of risk limits in the current environment. 
  We periodically assess the collectability or credit quality related to securities purchased under agreements to resell. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a summary of ECB s assets, liabilities and risk measures related to its collateralized financing activities is as follows: 

Contractual Obligations 
  For a further discussion of our contractual obligations, refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we were unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority per ASC 740; hence, unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from this disclosure. 
  We had total commitments (not reflected on our   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition  ) relating to future capital contributions to private equity funds of   $5.1 million   and $8.2 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations. We may be required to fund these commitments at any time through June 2023, depending on the timing and level of investments by our private equity funds.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support, or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
  Market Risk and Credit Risk 
  We, in general, are not a capital-intensive organization and as such, are not subject to significant market or credit risks. Nevertheless, we have established procedures to assess both the market and credit risk, as well as specific investment risk, exchange rate risk and credit risk related to receivables. 
  Market and Investment Risk 
  We hold equity securities and invest in exchange traded funds and mutual funds, principally as an economic hedge against our deferred compensation program. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our investments with these products, based on closing prices, was $27.1 million. 
  We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the market value of the investments would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $2.7 million for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  See "-Liquidity and Capital Resources" above for a discussion of collateralized financing transactions at ECB. 
  Private Equity Funds 
  Through our principal investments in our private equity funds and our ability to earn carried interest from these funds, we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which these funds invest. Our professionals devote considerable time and resources to work closely with the portfolio company s management to assist in designing a business strategy, allocating capital and other resources and evaluating expansion or acquisition opportunities. On a quarterly basis, we perform a comprehensive analysis and valuation of all of the portfolio companies. Our analysis includes reviewing the current market conditions and valuations of each portfolio company. Valuations and analysis regarding our investment in Trilantic are performed by their respective professionals, and thus we are not involved in determining the fair value for the portfolio companies of such funds. 
  We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the private equity funds would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $1.1 million for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Exchange Rate Risk 
  We have foreign operations, through our subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily in Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as provide services to clients in other jurisdictions, which creates foreign exchange rate risk. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign exchange fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or otherwise. An appreciation or depreciation of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would result in an adverse or beneficial impact to our financial results. A significant portion of our Latin American revenues have been, and will continue to be, derived from contracts denominated in Mexican pesos and Brazilian real and Evercore Partners Limited's revenue and expenses are denominated primarily in British pounds sterling and euro. Historically, the value of these foreign currencies has fluctuated relative to the U.S. dollar. For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies recorded in Other Comprehensive Income within the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was   ($11.9) million  . It is currently not our intention to hedge our foreign currency exposure, and we will reevaluate this policy from time to time. 
  Credit Risks 
  We maintain cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings. At times, we may maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured ("FDIC") limits or enter into sweep arrangements where banks will periodically transfer a portion of the Company's excess cash position to a money market fund. However, we believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institution or investment vehicles in which those deposits are held.

Accounts Receivable consists primarily of advisory fees and expense reimbursements billed to our clients. Receivables are reported net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for probable losses from our customer receivables and derive the estimate through specific identification for the allowance for doubtful accounts and an assessment of the client s creditworthiness. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total receivables amounted to   $146.3 million   and   $175.5 million  , respectively, net of an allowance. The Investment Banking and Investment Management receivables collection periods generally are within 90 days of invoice, with the exception of placement fees, which are generally collected within 180 days of invoice. The collection period for restructuring transactions and private equity fee receivables may exceed 90 days. We recorded minimal bad debt expense for each of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  With respect to our Marketable Securities portfolio, which is comprised primarily of highly-rated corporate and municipal bonds, mutual funds and securities investments, we manage our credit risk exposure by limiting concentration risk and maintaining investment grade credit quality. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had Marketable Securities of   $66.5 million  , of which   59%   were corporate and municipal securities, primarily with S P ratings ranging from AAA to BB+. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and their notes, including reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact or potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
   
                 Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

See "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Market Risk and Credit Risk." We do not believe we face any material interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity price risk or other market risk except as disclosed in Item 2 "   Market Risk and Credit Risk" above. 
   
                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
  We have not made any changes during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
                 Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

In the normal course of business, from time to time the Company and its affiliates are involved in judicial or regulatory proceedings, arbitration or mediation concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its businesses, including contractual and employment matters. In addition, Mexican, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canadian and United States government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings regarding the Company s business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or its directors, officers or employees. In view of the inherent difficulty of determining whether any loss in connection with such matters is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot estimate the amount of such loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that it is not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a material effect on the Company. Provisions for losses are established in accordance with ASC 450, "  Contingencies"   when warranted  .   Once established, such provisions are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. 
  In January 2015, Donna Marie Coburn filed a proposed class action complaint against Evercore Trust Company ("ETC") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in which she purported to represent a class of participants in the J.C. Penney Corporation Inc. Savings, Profit-Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan (the "Plan") whose participant accounts held J.C. Penney stock at any time between May 15, 2012 and the present. The complaint alleged that ETC breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by causing the Plan to invest in J.C. Penney stock during that period and claimed that the Plan suffered losses of approximately   $300 million   due to declines in J.C. Penney stock. ETC believes that it has meritorious defenses against the plaintiff s claims and intends to vigorously defend the action. ETC is indemnified by J.C. Penney, and ultimately the Plan, for reasonable attorneys  fees and other legal expenses, which would be refunded should ETC not prevail. On April 13, 2015, ETC moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and on February 17, 2016, the district court granted ETC s motion to dismiss. On March 15, 2016, plaintiff noticed an appeal of the district court s decision. The case was argued to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on October 13, 2016, and the parties are awaiting a decision. 
   
                 Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 

A U.K. exit from the European Union could adversely impact our business and operations. 
  In June 2016, United Kingdom ("U.K.") voters voted in a non-binding referendum for the U.K. to exit the European Union ("E.U."). A U.K. exit from the E.U., together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of any exit, could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions, contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and European euro and introduce significant legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations. Our U.K. entities, Evercore Partners International LLP and International Strategy   Investment (UK) Limited, primarily service European-domiciled clients. Adverse conditions arising from a U.K. exit from the E.U. could adversely affect our U.K. business and operations, including by reducing the volume or size of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic corporate transactions on which we seek to advise. A U.K. exit from the E.U. could also cause our U.K entities to lose their E.U. financial services passport licenses, which allow them to operate, on a cross-border and off-shore basis, into all E.U. countries without obtaining regulatory approval outside of the U.K., which would increase our legal, compliance and operational costs.  
  For a discussion of other material risks, see "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

(2) 
    In October 2014, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of additional Class A Shares and/or LP Units so that we will be able to repurchase an aggregate of seven million Class A Shares and/or LP Units for up to $350.0 million. On April 25, 2016, our Board authorized the repurchase of additional Class A Shares and/or LP Units so that going forward we will be able to repurchase an aggregate of 7.5 million Class A Shares and/or LP Units for up to $450.0 million. Under this share repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual amount of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, economic and market conditions and the objective to reduce the dilutive effect of equity awards granted. This program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
