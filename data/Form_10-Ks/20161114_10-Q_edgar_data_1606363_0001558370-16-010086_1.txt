1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Green Bancorp, Inc. ( Green Bancorp ), together with Green Bank, N.A., its subsidiary bank, (the  Company ).  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.   

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial information.  In the opinion of management, the interim statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company on a consolidated basis and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  These financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period.   		 
		 
			 Organization   Green Bancorp is a Texas corporation that was incorporated on October 20, 2004. In 2006 Green Bancorp entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Redstone Bank, National Association ( Redstone Bank ), a national banking association located in Houston, Texas, for the purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding stock of Redstone Bank. The acquisition was completed on December 31, 2006, and Green Bancorp became a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. 

Green Bank, N.A. (the  Bank ) is a national banking association, which was chartered under the laws of the United States of America as a national bank on February 17, 1999, as Redstone Bank. On September 14, 2007, the name was changed to Green Bank, N.A. The Bank provides commercial and consumer banking services in the greater Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas. 

Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of available-for-sale securities, acquired assets and liabilities, goodwill, and fair value of financial instruments. 

2. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic earnings per common share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 

Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares determined for the basic earnings per common share computation plus the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Outstanding stock options issued by the Company represent the only dilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted average shares. In the event of a net loss, the outstanding stock options are excluded from the diluted earnings per common share calculation due to their anti-dilutive effect and the diluted net loss per common share would be equal to or less than basic net loss per common share.

The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

On April 30, 2015, the Company announced the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which it authorized the Company to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $15.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock.  The repurchase program remains in place, but may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.  Under the authorized stock repurchase agreement, the Company could repurchase shares in open-market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions as permitted under Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of $1.3 million of the Company s outstanding common stock under this program at an average price of $7.04 per share.  From April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the Company made no repurchases under the program. 		 

3. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) 

FASB ASU No. 2014-09      Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606)    supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  Additionally ASU 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts (Subtopic 605-35).  In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement.  The core principal of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The adoption of this ASU becomes effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2018, with retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented.  The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-09, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2014-12      Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period    requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.  The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.  Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.  If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period.  The total amount of the compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.  The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.  The adoption of this ASU was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

(Unaudited) 

FASB ASU No. 2015-01       Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.    ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items, which, among other things, required an entity to segregate extraordinary items considered to be unusual and infrequent from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. ASU 2015-01 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 

FASB ASU No. 2015-02      Consolidation (Topic 810)   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.    ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments: (1) Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, (2) Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (3) Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, (4) Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2A-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2015-03      Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 

FASB ASU No. 2015-05      Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.    ASU 2015-05 provides a basis for evaluating whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, then the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 

FASB ASU No. 2015-07      Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).    On May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07 to gain consistency within the categorization of the fair value hierarchy.  The update removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.  It also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The ASU was effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  ASU 2015-07 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2015-14      Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.    In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of the previously issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   until the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier application is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  Additionally ASU 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in   Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts (Subtopic 605-35)  .  In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement.  The core principal of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2018, with retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented.  The Company is

FASB ASU No. 2015-15      Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting.     In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 that adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015, Emerging Issues Task Force meeting about the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,    Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which requires the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2015-16      Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.     ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer must record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Additionally, the entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2015-17      Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, as part of its simplification initiative. The ASU requires entities to present deferred tax assets ( DTAs ) and deferred tax liabilities ( DTLs ) as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. It thus simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Netting of DTAs and DTLs by tax jurisdiction is still required under the new guidance. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The adoption of the provisions of ASU 2015-17 upon issuance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2016-01      Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 (i) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (iii) eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (iv) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (v) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (vi) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (vii) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this update affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

FASB ASU No. 2016-02      Leases (Topic 842).    In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02 to supersede nearly all existing lease guidance under GAAP. The guidance would require a lessee to record a right-to-use asset and liability representing the obligation to make lease payments for long-term leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU No. 2016-09          Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    ASU 2016-09 was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. This ASU covers accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s financial statements.  

FASB ASU 2016-12          Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.    ASU 2016-12 addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s financial statements, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU 2016-10          Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.    ASU 2016-10 clarifies two aspects of    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)    (i) identifying performance obligations and (ii) the licensing implementation guidance. This ASU adds guidance on how to identify the promised goods or services in the contract and how to evaluate whether promised goods and services are distinct. Additionally, this update includes guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time) and when to recognize revenue for a sales-based or use-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in   ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ,  which is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s financial statements, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2016-13        "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)"   ("ASU 2016-13") requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model to estimate its lifetime "expected credit loss" and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The CECL model is expected to result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also requires new disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost, loans and available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 13, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on the Company s financial statements. 		 
		 
			 FASB ASU No. 2016-15     "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments"   ("ASU 2016-15") is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15   provides classification guidance on certain cash receipts and cash payments, including, but not limited to, debt prepayment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees. This   ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on the Company s financial statements.

4. ACQUISITIONS 

Acquisitions have been in the past and may be in the future an important part of the Company s growth strategy. All acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets for tax-free acquisitions is recorded as goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets for taxable acquisitions was recorded as goodwill, and is deductible for tax purposes. The identified core deposit intangibles for each acquisition are being amortized using an accelerated basis over an estimated life of six to nineteen years. The results of operations for each acquisition have been included in the Company s consolidated financial results beginning on the respective acquisition date. 		 
		 
			 Patriot Bancshares, Inc.   - On October 1, 2015, the Company completed the merger of Patriot with and into the Company and the merger of Patriot s wholly-owned subsidiary, Patriot Bank, with and into the Bank.  Patriot, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operated six locations in Houston, two in Dallas and one in Fannin County, Texas.  As of September 30, 2015, Patriot, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $1.4 billion, total loans of $1.1 billion, total deposits of $1.1 billion and total shareholders  equity of $125.2 million.  

Under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued 10.4 million shares of the Company s common stock, with a total fair value of $123.7 million based on the closing price on October 1, 2015 of $11.85 per share, for all outstanding shares of Patriot common stock, including the converted Series D and Series F preferred stock.  In addition, Patriot s $27.3 million Series B and Series C preferred stock were redeemed in connection with the closing.  Consistent with the Company s strategy, the primary reasons for the Patriot acquisition were to enhance market share in Houston and Dallas, and improve profitability through cost savings and revenue synergies. 

In connection with the merger, we recognized $55.2 million of goodwill, $8.3 million of core deposit intangibles, and $7.3 million in net deferred tax assets.  None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 

5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Bank, as a correspondent of the Federal Reserve Bank, is required to maintain average reserve balances.  Interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions include restricted amounts of $63.2 million and $70.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as a result of this requirement.

The amortized cost and fair value of securities as of the dates set forth were as follows:

Expected maturities of securities will differ from contractual maturities because the underlying borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The following table sets forth, as of the date indicated, contractual maturities of securities: 

There were no sales of securities during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are evaluated for OTTI under FASB ASC 320,   Investments Debt and Equity Securities  . 

In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.  

When OTTI occurs, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not intend to sell any debt securities classified as held-to-maturity and management believes that the Company more likely than not will not be required to sell any debt securities that are in a loss position before their anticipated recovery, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2016, management does not have the intent to sell any of its securities classified as available-for-sale that are in a loss position and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, management believes any impairment in the Company s securities is temporary and no impairment loss has been realized in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 		 
		 
			 Declines in the fair value of individual securities below their cost that are other-than-temporary would result in writedowns, as a realized loss, to their fair value. In evaluating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers several factors including the severity and the duration that the fair value has been less than cost, the credit quality of the issuer, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value. The Company has not realized any losses due to other-than-temporary impairment of securities as of September 30, 2016.

Securities with unrealized losses segregated by length of continuous unrealized loss position as of the dates set forth were as follows: 

The average loss on securities in an unrealized loss position was 0.69% and 0.55% of the amortized cost basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There were four and six securities in an unrealized loss position of greater than 12 months at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The Company did not own securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government and its agencies or sponsored enterprises) for which the aggregate adjusted cost exceeds 10% of the consolidated shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Securities with an amortized cost of $12.9 million and $14.9 million and fair value of $13.0 million and $15.0 million were pledged and available to be sold under repurchase agreements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Securities with an amortized cost of $76.8 million and $97.3 million and fair value of $77.1 million and $97.1 million were pledged to various Federal Reserve Districts related to deposits of bankruptcy trustees at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  In addition, securities with an amortized cost of $5.6 million and $2.8 million and fair value of $5.7 million and $2.9 million were pledged as collateral for the Company s derivative instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

7. LOANS 

The loan portfolio classified by type and class as of the dates set forth were as follows: 

The loan portfolio is comprised of three types, commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans and consumer and other loans. The real estate loans are further segregated into owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial real estate, which includes multi-family loans, construction, land and land development, which includes both commercial construction and loans for the construction of residential properties and residential mortgage, which includes first and second liens and home equity lines.  Consumer and other loans includes various types of loans to consumers and overdrafts.  Loans are further separated between loans originated by the Company and loans acquired. 

Included in the loans held for investment balance was $18.3 million and $19.8 million of net deferred loan origination fees and unamortized premium and discount at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Also included in loans at

September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $5.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively, in nonaccretable discount on acquired credit impaired loans. Accrued interest receivable on loans was $6.6 million and $7.3 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Consumer and other loans include overdrafts of $74 thousand and $560 thousand as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The loan portfolio consists of various types of loans made to borrowers principally located in the Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas. Although the portfolio is diversified and generally secured by various types of collateral, a substantial portion of its debtors  ability to honor their obligations is dependent on local economic conditions. The risks created by this geographic concentration and our exposure to energy related borrowers have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.   

Reserved-based energy loans outstanding represented approximately 0.9% and 4.2% of total funded loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Energy related service industry loans represented approximately 3.4% and 5.2% of total funded loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, $25.8 million and $32.3 million of reserved-based energy loans and $38.0 million and $291 thousand of energy related service industry loans were impaired, respectively.  Management believes the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover estimated losses on loans at each balance sheet date. 

Most of the Company s activities are with customers located within the Texas cities of Houston, Dallas, Honey Grove, Austin and their respective surrounding areas.  Therefore, the Company s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in the Houston and Dallas MSA s.  The Company does not have any significant concentration to any one industry or customer. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of 10% of total loans. 

Loan maturities and rate sensitivity of the loans held for investment, as of the date indicated, were as follows: 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has granted loans to certain directors, officers and their affiliates. In the opinion of management, all transactions entered into between the Bank and such related parties have been and are in the ordinary course of business, made on the same terms and conditions as similar transactions with unaffiliated persons.

Changes in the accretable yield for credit impaired acquired loans for the periods indicated, were as follows: 

Purchased credit impaired loans are evaluated on an ongoing basis after acquisition.  Reclassifications from nonaccretable discount to accretable yield are recorded based on the current estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows. 

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans     When management doubts a borrower s ability to meet payment obligations, which typically occurs when principal or interest payments are more than 90 days past due, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status.

Impaired Loans     The following is a summary of information related to impaired, nonaccrual and restructured loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more as of the dates set forth: 

Based on an analysis of impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an allowance of $11.6 million and $14.8 million, respectively, was allocated to impaired loans. The average recorded investment in impaired loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $71.3 million and $16.7 million, respectively. There was approximately $382 thousand and $39 thousand in interest recognized on impaired loans, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  There was approximately $757 thousand and $324 thousand in interest recognized on impaired loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Interest recognized includes interest accrued on restructured loans that are performing based on their restructured terms and interest collected on paid nonaccrual loans. 

Impaired loans of $93.5 million and $39.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively, have been categorized by management as nonaccrual loans.  This increase was due primarily to migration to nonperforming loans in the acquired and energy portfolios.  Interest foregone on nonaccrual loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.8 million and $83 thousand, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $3.4 million and $313 thousand, respectively.

Credit Quality     Internally assigned risk grades for loans are defined as follows: 

Grade 1 (Highest Quality   No Apparent Risk)     This category includes loans to borrowers of unquestioned credit standing which are secured by readily marketable collateral of undisputed value, with appropriate margin. It also includes loans to borrowing entities with: excellent capitalization, liquidity and earnings levels; quality management; positive financial trends; and favorable industry conditions. 

Grade 2 (Good Quality   Minimal Risk)     This category includes loans to investment grade entities with: good liquidity and financial condition; nominal term debt; strong debt service capability; solid management; and quality financial information. These loans are usually secured with current assets, but may be unsecured. Alternative financing from other lenders is generally available to these borrowers. 

Grade 3 (Satisfactory Quality   Acceptable Risk   Tier One)     This category includes loans to entities maintaining fair liquidity and acceptable financial conditions. The level of term debt is moderate, with adequate debt service capability. Earnings may be volatile, but borrowers in this category generally do not show a loss within the last three years. Primary debt service must be supported by identified secondary repayment sources or by guarantors with adequate and proven responsibility and capacity. 

Grade 4 (Satisfactory Quality   Acceptable Risk   Tier Two)     This category includes loans to borrowers maintaining acceptable financial conditions; however, borrowers may exhibit certain characteristics of leverage or asset dependency that reflect a greater level of risk than Tier One credits. This category may also include borrowers exhibiting explainable interim losses within the previous three years and/or industry characteristics that warrant frequent monitoring. 

Grade 5 (Monitored Loans)     This category includes loans with trends or characteristics which, if continued, could result in impaired repayment ability. The borrower may exhibit a low degree of liquidity and relatively high leverage, erratic earnings history (including the possibility of a reported loss in the past four years), significant term debt and a nominal cushion for debt service capacity. Loans in this category may also include financing to start-up borrowers backed by experienced management and significant capital investment or established companies in distressed industry conditions. 

Grade 6 (Other Assets Especially Mentioned)     This category includes loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or a weakening of the Company s credit position at some future date. Grade 6 loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 

Grade 7 (Substandard   Accruing)     This category includes loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any, or loans with identified weaknesses but where there is sufficient collateral value and/or cash flow coverage. This category includes loans that: (1) may require a secondary source of repayment (liquidation of collateral or repayment by a guarantor); (2) lack current financial information or appraisals; and/or (3) have collateral deficiencies such that the Company would be in an unsecured position with an obligor not deserving unsecured credit. This category may also include borrowers with operating losses in recent periods. 

Grade 8 (Substandard   Nonaccrual)     This category includes loans (1) with the same basic characteristics as Grade 7 loans and (2) has also meet the Company s criteria for nonaccrual status, but do not warrant a Grade 9 or Grade 10 classification. 

Grade 9 (Doubtful/Exposure)     This category includes loans with all the Grade 7 or 8 characteristics but with weaknesses that make collection (or liquidation) highly questionable and improbable. 

Grade 10 (Loss)     This category includes loans which are considered uncollectible, or of such little value that they should no longer be carried as an asset of the Company.

Troubled Debt Restructurings     The restructuring of a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring if both the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the creditor has granted a concession. Concessions may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses.  

Troubled debt restructurings identified during the periods indicated were as follows: 

The modifications   primarily relate to extending the maturity date of the loans, which includes loans modified post-bankruptcy. The Company did not forgive any principal or interest on the restructured   loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company added $8.8 in new troubled debt restructuring of which $8.6 million was still outstanding on September 30, 2016.  The decrease in outstanding balance was primarily due to payments received.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company added $7.1 million in new troubled debt restructurings of which $6.3 million was still outstanding on September 30, 2015.  The decrease in outstanding balance was primarily due to payments received.  Troubled debt restructurings are individually evaluated for impairment.

9. PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT 

Premises and equipment as of the dates indicated are summarized as follows: 

Depreciation of premises and equipment totaled $581 thousand and $394 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.6 million and $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

10. GOODWILL AND CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES 

The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management determined that goodwill, as reflected in the Company s financial statements, was not impaired.  The most recent goodwill impairment test was as of December 31, 2015.  Subsequent to year end, management has determined that no triggering events have occurred that would result in impairment. 

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and core deposit intangibles for the periods set forth were as follows: 

Amortization of core deposit intangibles was $402 thousand and $148 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.2 million and $444 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

The Company initially records the total premium paid on acquisitions as goodwill.  After finalizing the valuation, core deposit intangibles are identified and reclassified from goodwill to core deposit intangibles on the balance sheet.  This reclassification has no effect on total assets, liabilities, shareholders  equity, net income or cash flows.  The measurement period for the Company to determine the fair value of acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities will be at the end of the earlier of (1) twelve months from the date of acquisition or (2) as soon as the Company receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the date of acquisition. The Company may record subsequent adjustments to goodwill for amounts undeterminable at the acquisition date, such as deferred taxes and real estate valuations.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances     The Company has an available borrowing arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank (the  FHLB ), which allows the Company to borrow on a collateralized basis. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total unused borrowing capacity of $603.9 million and $355.1 million, respectively, was available under this arrangement. At September 30, 2016,  $150.0 million was outstanding with an average interest rate of 0.41% and all of the Company s FHLB advances will mature within two years. At December 31, 2015,  $223.3 million was outstanding with an average interest rate of 0.46% and all of the Company s FHLB advances will mature within eight years. These borrowings are collateralized by a blanket lien on certain loans. The total borrowing capacity increased due to loan portfolio growth. The Company utilizes these borrowings to meet liquidity needs and to fund certain fixed rate loans in its loan portfolio. 		 
		 
			 Federal Reserve Bank     The Company has an available borrower in custody arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (the  Dallas Fed ), which allows the Company to borrow, on a collateralized basis. Certain commercial and consumer loans are pledged under this arrangement. The Company maintains this borrowing arrangement to meet liquidity needs pursuant to its contingency funding plan. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  $303.8 million and $243.9 million, respectively, were available under this arrangement and no borrowings were outstanding.  The available capacity increased due to changes in collateral margins for Dallas Fed discount window lending. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase     Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent the purchase of interests in securities by banking customers. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. Repurchase agreements with banking customers are settled on the following business day. All securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized by pledged securities. The securities underlying the repurchase agreements are held in safekeeping by the Bank s safekeeping agent.  

Federal Funds Purchased     The Company has available federal funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no federal funds purchased outstanding. 

13. SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES  

At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding $13.5 million in subordinated debentures net of $8.7 million purchase discount. On October 1, 2015, the Company acquired Patriot Bancshares, Inc., and assumed the obligations related to the subordinated debentures issued to Capital Trust I and Capital Trust II.  

A summary of pertinent information related to the Company s two issues of subordinated debentures outstanding at September 30, 2016 is set forth in the table below:  

(2) 

All debentures are callable five years from issuance date.

Each of the trusts is a capital trust organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds in the Company s junior subordinated debentures. The trust preferred securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust. The common securities of each trust are 100% owned by the Company. Each trust s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon the Company making payment on the related subordinated debentures. The debentures, which are the only assets of each trust, are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company s present and future senior indebtedness. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each trust s obligations under the trust securities issued by such trust to the extent not paid or made by each trust, provided such trust has funds available for such obligations.  		 

Under the provisions of each issue of the debentures, the Company has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time to time, for periods not exceeding five years. If interest payments on either issue of the debentures are deferred, the distributions on the applicable trust preferred securities and common securities will also be deferred. 

14. INCOME TAXES 

Income tax expense (benefit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:     

The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal tax rate of 35% largely due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities and loans and the nontaxable earnings on bank owned life insurance  . 

Net deferred tax assets totaled $20.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $19.5 million at December 31, 2015. No valuation allowance was recorded against deferred tax assets as of those dates, as management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized because they were supported by recoverable taxes paid in prior years  . 

15. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

Equity Incentive Plan     The 2014 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) was approved by the Company s Board of Directors and shareholders on July 28, 2014 and became effective immediately prior to the initial public offering on August 7, 2014.

The non-qualified stock options granted were in the form of time-based options and performance options and may have been granted to a director, officer or employee of the Company. Time-based options under the 2010 Option Plan vest over a period of four years and expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant. Performance options under the 2010 Option Plan vest upon the occurrence of a liquidity event, with the vested amounts determined based on the achievement of specified performance and market metrics.  The 2010 Option Plan was frozen to further issuance upon approval of the 2014 Omnibus Plan.  At September 30, 2016 there were 380,902 time based options, 1,223,234 performance options and 379,529 super-performance options outstanding under the 2010 Option Plan.

Awards under the 2006 Option Plan vest over a four-year period, which began on the first anniversary of the grant date, and must be exercised within 10 years from the grant date. The 2006 Option Plan was frozen to further issuance upon approval of the 2010 Option Plan. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 202,500 and 292,757 options outstanding under the 2006 Option Plan, respectively. 

In addition to the 2006 Option Plan, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the Redstone Bank 2004 Stock Option Plan (the  Redstone Option Plan ) and froze the plan to further issuance, following the Company s acquisition of Redstone Bank. At the time of adoption, all options to acquire stock of Redstone Bank were converted to options to acquire stock of the Company and adjusted in terms of number and exercise price based on the terms of the merger agreement. All options issued under the Redstone Option Plan are fully vested as a result of the 2006 change of control event. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 225,407 and 234,573 options outstanding under the Redstone Option Plan, respectively.

Stock Appreciation Rights Plan     On May 18, 2007, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the Green Bancorp Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the  SAR Plan ). The SAR Plan provided for the issuance of up to 200,000 units to plan participants at an exercise price of no less than the fair market value of the common stock of the Company at the time of grant. Units are redeemable by SAR Plan participants under certain circumstances whereby the participant will be paid the excess, if any, of the market value of the Company s common stock at the time of exercise over the exercise price. The SAR Plan provides for a 10-year maximum term for units issued, vesting and exercisability limitations and accelerated vesting and deemed exercise in the event of a change of control. The SAR Plan was frozen to further issuance upon approval of the 2014 Omnibus Plan.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 93,000 and 103,000 units outstanding under the SAR Plan, respectively. 		 
		 
			 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $114 thousand and $2 thousand of stock based compensation expense to reflect the fair value of the SARs was recorded, respectively.

16. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The following table summarizes the Company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of the date indicated (other than securities sold under agreements to repurchase).  The Company s future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its certificates and other time deposits, FHLB advances, subordinated debentures and operating leases, as of the date indicated are as follows: 

Payments for the FHLB advances includes interest of $837 thousand that will be paid in future years.  Payments for subordinated debentures includes interest of $12.2 million that will be paid in future years.  The future interest payments were calculated using the current rate in effect at September 30, 2016.  Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts. 

Leases     The Company s noncancelable future operating lease commitments as of the date indicated is as follows: 

The Company leases certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Rent expense under all noncancelable operating lease obligations, net of income from noncancelable subleases aggregated, was approximately $627 thousand and $340 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was $1.7 million and $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Litigation     The Company from time to time is involved in routine litigation arising from the normal course of business. Management does not believe that there are any pending or threatened proceedings against the Company which, upon resolution, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk     In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making these commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

The following is a summary of the various financial instruments outstanding as of the date set forth: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total commitment amounts disclosed above do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by the Company, upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 

Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event of nonperformance by the customer, the Company has rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. The credit risk to the Company in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to its customers. 

17. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

In order to accommodate the borrowing needs of certain commercial customers, the Company entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements with those customers. In order to offset the exposure and manage interest rate risk, at the time an agreement was entered into with a customer, the Company entered into an interest rate swap or cap with a correspondent bank counterparty with offsetting terms. These derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in the net fair value are recognized in noninterest income or expense.   Because we act as an intermediary for our customers, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts substantially offset each other and do not have a material impact on our results of operations.   The fair value amounts are included in other assets and other liabilities. 

The following is a summary of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of the dates set forth:

The estimated fair values of non-hedging derivative instruments are reflected within Company s consolidated balance sheet; customer interest rate swaps are included in other assets and correspondent interest rate swaps are included in other liabilities. The notional amounts and estimated fair values of the non-hedging derivative instruments by classification as the dates set forth were as follows: 

The strike rate for the outstanding caps was 6.00% at both September30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

18. REGULATORY MATTERS 

Capital Requirements     The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Any institution that fails to meet its minimum capital requirements is subject to actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on its financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines based on the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s capital amount and classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules for the adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (the "Basel III Capital Rules"). The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called "Common Equity Tier 1" ("CET1"), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 Capital" instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing

regulations. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 with certain transition provisions to be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.   

Beginning on January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer was effective for the Company starting at the 0.625% level and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios.  

Financial institutions are categorized as  well capitalized  or  adequately capitalized , based on minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As shown in the table below, the Company s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory definition of  adequately capitalized  as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. Based upon the information in its most recently filed call report, the Bank met the capital ratios necessary to be  well capitalized . The regulatory authorities can apply changes in classification of assets and such changes may retroactively subject the Company to changes in capital ratios. Any such changes could result in reducing one or more capital ratios below  well-capitalized  status. In addition, a change may result in imposition of additional assessments by the FDIC or could result in regulatory actions that could have a material effect on condition and results of operations. 		 
		 
			 To meet the capital adequacy requirements, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios as defined in the regulations. Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 

The most recent notification from the regulatory banking agencies categorized Green Bank as  well capitalized  under the regulatory capital framework for prompt corrective action and there have been no events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category. 

The Company s consolidated capital ratios and the Bank s capital ratios as of the dates set forth are presented in the following table:

(1) 

The Federal Reserve may require the Company to maintain capital ratios above the required minimums.     

(2) 

The FDIC or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ) may require the Bank to maintain capital ratios above the required minimums.     

Dividend Restrictions     Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies.

19. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

ASC 820 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under an existing accounting pronouncement. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows: 

Level 1     Inputs that utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 

Level 2     Inputs other than those quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 2 assets and liabilities include available-for-sale securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Available-for-sale securities are valued using observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, prepayment speeds, credit information, and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. Derivative valuations utilize certain Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The significance of the impact of these credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of derivative positions are not significant to the overall valuation and result in all derivative valuations being classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Level 3     Inputs that are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. This category includes certain interest-only strip securities where independent pricing information was not able to be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets and loans held for sale. 		 
		 
			 The tables below presents the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates set forth aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall. 

Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Assets measured on a nonrecurring basis include impaired loans, real estate acquired by foreclosure and other repossessed assets. 

A loan is defined as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  The allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the impaired loan and its fair value.  The fair value of impaired loans is determined based on the fair value of the collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.  Fair value of the loan s collateral is determined by appraisals and third party estimates for real estate collateral and by appraisals or independent valuations for non-real estate collateral such as inventory, accounts receivable, equipment or other business assets.  The fair value of real estate acquired by foreclosure is measured using appraisals and third party estimates.  These values may be adjusted based on current information available to management, therefore the values are considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.

The following tables present the assets that were subject to fair value adjustments during the periods indicated, which were still on the balance sheet at the end of the reporting periods: 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of cash and of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 

Cash and Short-Term Investments     The carrying amount of these short term investments is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Securities     The fair value of securities are obtained from an independent pricing service.  Securities are valued based on quoted prices in an active market when available. These securities are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated and classified as Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury and other yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security s terms and conditions, among other things.   

Loans Held for Sale     The fair value of consumer residential mortgages held-for-sale is based on commitments from investors or prevailing market prices. 

Loans Held for Investment     The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. 

Real Estate Acquired by Foreclosure     Real estate acquired by foreclosure is adjusted to fair value less estimated costs to sell at the time of foreclosure. Subsequently, these assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally based upon market prices or appraised values of the property, and accordingly, the Company classifies real estate acquired by foreclosure as Level 3. 

Deposit Liabilities     The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Other Borrowed Funds     The carrying amount of securities sold under agreements to repurchase is a reasonable estimate of fair value because these borrowings reprice at market rates generally daily. The fair value of long term FHLB advances is estimated using the rates currently offered for advances of similar remaining maturities. 

Subordinated debentures   The fair value of the subordinated debentures was calculated using the quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar subordinated debentures. Subordinated debentures fair value measurements utilize Level 2 inputs. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments     The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of guarantees and letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. These amounts were not significant at the reporting dates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from pricing models based on past, present and projected future market conditions, quoted market prices of instruments with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows, classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Item 2. Management s   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company s interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report and with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2015. 

Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the terms  Company,   we,   us,   our,   our company  and  our business  refer to Green Bancorp, Inc. and our subsidiaries, including our banking subsidiary; Green Bank, N.A., a national banking association, and the term  Bank  refers to Green Bank, N.A. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to the Houston Sugar Land Baytown and Dallas Fort Worth Arlington metropolitan statistical areas as the Houston and Dallas MSAs. 

Overview  

We are a Texas focused bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Green Bank, N.A., a nationally chartered commercial bank, provides commercial and private banking services primarily to Texas based customers through twenty-two full service branches in the Houston and Dallas MSAs and other markets. The Houston and Dallas MSAs are our target markets, and we believe their growing economies and attractive demographics, together with our scalable platform, provide us with opportunities for long term and sustainable growth. Our emphasis is on continuing to expand our existing business by executing on our proven business model as well as pursuing select strategic acquisitions and attracting additional talented portfolio bankers. 

We generate the majority of our revenues from interest income on loans, customer service and loan fees and income from investment in securities. The revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and noninterest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread, (4) our net interest margin and (5) our provision for loan losses. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders  equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 		 
		 
			 Total assets were $3.9 billion as of September 30, 2016 compared with $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $143.7 million or 3.8%. Total deposits were $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2016 compared with $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $215.2 million or 6.9%. Total loans held for investment were $3.0 billion at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $83.1 million or 2.7% compared with $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in loans held for investment is primarily due to the resolution of loans through the Managed Asset Reduction Strategy ( MARS ) initiative, which has more than offset loan production during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Loans held for sale were $38.9 million at September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $93.5 million and $39.0 million, respectively, in non-accrual loans and our allowance for loan losses was $35.9 million and $32.9 million, respectively. Shareholders  equity was $426.2 million and $429.4 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 		 
		 
			 Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity:  

Allowance for loan losses   The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management estimates to be appropriate to absorb probable credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  This estimate involves numerous assumptions and judgments.  Management utilizes a calculation methodology that includes both quantitative and qualitative factors and applies judgment when establishing the factors utilized in the methodology and in assessing the overall adequacy of the calculated results. 

48 

Table of Contents  

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for losses incurred on loans. All losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a loss is probable. Recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two components: a general component based upon probable but unidentified losses inherent in the portfolio and a specific component on individual loans that are considered impaired. 

The general component of the allowance for loan losses related to probable but unidentified losses inherent in the portfolio is based on our actual historical loss experience and various qualitative factors.  The qualitative factors include lending policies and procedures, loan volume and terms, experience, depth and ability of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans and monitored loans, quality of loan review system, concentrations, value of collateral underlying collateral dependent loans,  economic conditions and other factors. Additional factors considered include the actual historical loss experience at the total portfolio level, a comparison of the allowance ratios to peer data, an analysis of the allowance by risk rating and other factors. 

To arrive at the general component of the allowance, loans are first separated into originated and acquired groups and then further separated by loan type for each group. On a quarterly basis, the trends in various metrics related to each of the factors described above are reviewed to determine the appropriate level of change to be applied to each factor for the period.  The factors described above are calculated for the applicable loan groups and for each loan type within the applicable group and then applied to the loan balance by type to calculate the general reserve. The actual loss factor is based on our loss migration analysis, which calculates the weighted average of actual losses by loan type and within each risk rating over the prior three years.  A minimum actual loss factor equal to the average three year loss history for the total loan portfolio is included as a qualitative factor.   

The specific component of the allowance for loan losses is calculated based on a review of individual loans considered impaired. The analysis of impaired losses may be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective loan rate, an observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral on collateral dependent loans. In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. The amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic, operating, or other conditions beyond our control. 

Throughout the year, management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the existing portfolio. Based on these estimates, an amount is charged to the provision for loan losses and credited to the allowance for loan losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb inherent losses.  If economic conditions or borrower behavior deviate substantially from the assumptions utilized in the allowance calculation, increases in the allowance may be required. 

Estimates of loan losses involve an exercise of judgment. While it is reasonably possible that in the near term we may sustain losses which are substantial relative to the allowance for loan losses, it is the judgment of management that the allowance for loan losses reflected in the consolidated balance sheets is adequate to absorb probable losses that exist in the current loan portfolio.  

Determining the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management s assessment of overall portfolio quality. We maintain the allowance at an amount that management believes is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses may result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 

Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Loan Losses   Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. No allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date, as the fair value of the acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. These fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, and based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof.  The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is considered the accretable discount and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the interest method.  		 

49 

Table of Contents  

Acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration and the probability that all contractually required payments will not be collected as of the date of acquisition are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 310-30. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected is considered the non-accretable discount. The non-accretable discount represents the future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows will result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses and a reclassification from non-accretable discount to accretable discount. 

At period-end after acquisition, the fair-valued acquired loans from each acquisition are reassessed to determine whether an addition to the allowance for credit losses is appropriate due to further credit quality deterioration. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans, see  Financial Condition   Allowance for loan losses  section below.   

Business combinations   The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805,   Business Combinations  . Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for tax-free acquisitions is recorded as goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for taxable acquisitions was also recorded as goodwill, and is deductible for tax purposes. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations for each acquisition have been included in the Company s consolidated financial results beginning on the respective acquisition date. 		 
		 
			 Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is considered a critical accounting estimate because the allocation of the fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to allocate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 

Goodwill   Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is subject to an annual impairment test and more frequently if a triggering event occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company, which is our only reporting unit, is below the carrying value of its equity. We completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of December 31, 2015, and based on this analysis, we do not believe any of our goodwill is impaired as of such date because the fair value of our equity substantially exceeded our carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Under the first step, the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill. If step one indicates a potential impairment, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. As part of our impairment analysis, we use a variety of methodologies in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, including cash flow analyses that are consistent with the assumptions management believes hypothetical marketplace participants would use. 		 
		 
			 Fair Value of Financial Instruments     The Company determines the fair market values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs include quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, Level 2 inputs are used. These inputs are based upon internally developed models that primarily use observable market-based parameters. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 		 
		 
			 Emerging Growth Company   Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, an emerging growth company can elect to opt in to any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or the SEC otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies. We have elected to opt in to such standards, which election is irrevocable.

We will likely take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. 

Recent Acquisitions 

On October 1, 2015, the Company completed the merger of Patriot with and into the Company and the merger of Patriot s wholly-owned subsidiary, Patriot Bank with and into the Bank.  Patriot, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operated six locations in Houston, two in Dallas and one in Fannin County, Texas.  As of September 30, 2015, Patriot, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $1.4 billion, total loans of $1.1 billion, total deposits of $1.1 billion and total shareholders  equity of $125.2 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued 10.4 million shares of the Company s common stock for all outstanding shares of Patriot common stock, including the converted Series D and Series F preferred stock.  In addition, Patriot s $27.3 million Series B and Series C preferred stock were redeemed in connection with the closing.  Consistent with the Company s strategy, the primary reasons for the Patriot acquisition were to enhance market share in Houston and Dallas, and improve profitability through cost savings and revenue synergies. 		 

In connection with the merger, we recognized $55.2 million of goodwill, $8.3 million of core deposit intangibles, and $7.3 million in net deferred tax assets.   

See  Note 4   Acquisitions  for further information. 

Results of Operations 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with three months ended September 30, 2015  .    Net loss was $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net income of $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $13.1 million or 320.3%.  Net loss per common share on a diluted basis was ($0.25) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net earnings per diluted share of $0.15 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $0.40 or 266.7%.  The decrease in net income was principally due to an increase in provision for loan losses primarily related to energy exposure.  We experienced returns on average common equity of (8.23%) and 5.37%, returns on average assets of (0.92%) and 0.68% and efficiency ratios of 61.9% and 59.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The efficiency ratio is calculated as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.  The decrease in the efficiency ratio was primarily due to increased net interest income. 		 
		 
			 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2015  .    For the nine months ended months ended September 30, 2016 net loss was $3.5 million compared with net income of $12.9 million for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $16.4 million or 127.3%. Net loss per common share on a diluted basis was ($0.10) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net earnings per diluted share of $0.49 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $0.59 or 120.4%. The decrease in net income was principally due to an increase in provision for loan losses primarily related to energy exposure.  We experienced returns on average common equity of (1.07%) and 5.80%, returns on average assets of (0.12%) and 0.75% and efficiency ratios of 56.0% and 63.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 		 
		 
			 Net Interest Income  

Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. Interest rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities, combine to affect net interest income. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a  volume change.  It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a  rate change.

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with three months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest income before the provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $33.7 million compared with $21.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $12.5 million or 59.1%.  The increase was primarily due to a $15.3 million increase in interest income on loans due to a 64.8% increase in average loan volume largely driven by the Patriot acquisition.  Interest income was $39.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $15.8 million or 67.1% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income on loans was $37.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $15.3 million or 67.7% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the increase in average loans outstanding and increase in the average loan yield. Interest income on securities was $989 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $180 thousand compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a 34 basis point increase in the average yield on the securities portfolio.  Interest income earned on deposits in financial institutions increased $268 thousand to $346 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to a 128.8% increase in the average balance and a 25 basis point increase in average yield. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.60% to 0.81% for the same time period resulting in an overall increase in interest expense of $3.3 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $127.6 million from $481.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $609.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Total cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, increased 21 basis points to 0.67% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.46% for the same period in 2015. 		 
		 
			 Net interest margin, defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.62%, a decrease of 1 basis points compared with 3.63% for the same period in 2015. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest income before the provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $101.4 million compared with $62.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $38.8 million or 62.0%.  The increase was primarily due to a 71.0% increase in average loan volume largely driven by the Patriot acquisition.  Interest income was $117.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $47.7 million or 68.5% compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income on loans was $113.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $46.5 million or 69.8% compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the increase in average loans outstanding, partially offset by the decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Interest income on securities was $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $533 thousand compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to a $23.6 million increase in the average balance. Interest income earned on deposits in financial institutions increased $441 thousand to $627 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a 73.4% increase in the average balance and a 25 basis point increase in average yield.  Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.61% to 0.76% for the same time period resulting in an overall increase in interest expense of $8.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $131.0 million from $468.1 million during the same period in 2015 to $599.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Total cost of funds including noninterest-bearing deposits, increased 16 basis points to 0.63% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.47% for the same period in 2015. 		 
		 
			 Net interest margin, defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.74%, a decrease of 5 basis points compared with 3.79% for the same period in 2015.

Provision for loan losses  

Our provision for loan losses are charged to income in order to bring our total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under   Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was $35.9 million, representing 1.18% of total loans, excluding loans held for sale, as of such date. 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with three months ended September 30, 2015  .    We recorded $28.2 million in provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $3.1 thousand in provision for the same period in 2015.  The provision recorded for the third quarter 2016, includes $19.2 million in reserves related to write downs of energy loans that were transferred to held for sale and $8.8 million in specific reserves added for loans placed on non-accrual during the period, of which $6.1 million is related to energy loans.  Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $39.7 million compared with net charge offs of $622 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase reflected an increase in gross charge-offs from $1.0 million to $39.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and a decrease in recoveries from $412 thousand to $116 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, charge-offs included $35.9 million related to energy loans that were transferred to held for sale and $3.3 million related to the disposition of other MARS loans.

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2015  .    The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $55.2 million compared with $5.4 million for the same period in 2015, which   $42.2 million of the $55.2 million provision is related to the energy portfolio.    Net charge offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $52.2 million compared with net charge offs of $245 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase reflected an increase in gross charge-offs from $2.5 million to $53.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and a decrease in recoveries from $2.2 million to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   $50.9 million in charge offs are related to the energy portfolio, which includes $38.3 million related to energy loans transferred to held for sale. 		 
		 
			 Noninterest Income 

Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are customer service fees, loan fees, gains on the sale of loans and available for sale securities and other service fees. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income totaled $4.1 million, an increase of $1.2 thousand or 42.5% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to a $656 thousand increase in customer service fees, a $374 thousand increase in swap income, a $183 thousand increase in bank owned life insurance and a $126 thousand increase in loan fees, offset by a $113 thousand decrease in gain on sale of loans held for sale. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income totaled $12.0 million, an increase of $4.1 million or 52.0% compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in customer service fees, a $931 thousand increase in swap income, a $539 thousand increase in bank owned life insurance income, and a $502 thousand increase in loan fees, all primarily due to the Patriot acquisition, and a $451 thousand increase in gain on sale of guaranteed portion of loans, offset by a $304 thousand decrease in gain on sale of loans held for sale. 

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income: 

Noninterest Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense totaled $23.4 million, an increase of $9.0 million or 62.7% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to increases related to ongoing acquired Patriot operations and expenses related to the MARS program of approximately $3.1 million.     

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense totaled $63.5 million, an increase of $18.8 million or 42.1% compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to increases related to ongoing acquired Patriot operations and MARS expenses.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense: 

Efficiency Ratio.    The efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in our internal evaluation of our performance. Efficiency ratio represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources. Our efficiency ratio was 61.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 59.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to increased net interest income and noninterest income, offset by an increase in noninterest expense primarily due to the Patriot acquisition.  Our efficiency ratio was 56.0% and 63.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Income Taxes 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, income tax benefit was $4.8 million, a decrease of $7.3 million or 291.1%, compared with income tax expense of $2.5 million for the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily attributable to lower pre-tax earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.  The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 35.0% and 38.3%, respectively. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax benefit was $1.8 million, a decrease of $9.3 million or 123.2%, compared with income tax expense of $7.6 million for the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily attributable to lower pre-tax net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.  The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 33.3% and 37.1%, respectively.

Financial Condition 

Loan Portfolio 

At September 30, 2016, total loans held for investment were $3.0 billion, a decrease of $83.1 million or 2.7% compared with December 31, 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to the resolution of loans through the MARS program, which has more than offset loan production during the period. 

At September 30, 2016, total loans held for sale were $38.9 million, an increase of $38.6 million compared with December 31, 2015.  Charge off of $35.9 million was recognized at the time these energy loans were transferred to held for sale.  The sales are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

The following tables summarize our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated:

Managed Asset Reduction Strategy ( MARS ) 

We have initiated a strategy to divest our portfolio of energy loans and certain other classified assets on an accelerated basis.  A team of eight workout professionals who report to our Corporate Chief Credit Officer have been assigned to focus solely on the resolution of the MARS  portfolio.  The MARS team will take a multifaceted approach to reducing the portfolio through the use of proven management and disposition techniques, which may include one or more of the following: (i) the restructure and substitution of collateral, (ii) a full refinancing by a third-party lender, (iii) a discounted pay-off by the borrower, (iv) a foreclosure and liquidation of the applicable collateral, (v)  one-off  note sales, and (vi) a portfolio sale.  During the third quarter of 2016, we resolved $80.6 million in energy related loans and transferred  $38.9 million in energy loans to held-for-sale at September 30, 2016. 		 
		 
			 Reserved-based energy loans held for investment represented approximately 0.9% and 4.2% of total funded loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Energy related service industry loans represented approximately 3.4% and 5.2% of total funded loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  $25.8 million and $32.3 million of reserved-based energy loans and $38.0 million and $291 thousand of energy related service industry loans were impaired, respectively. 

Nonperforming Loans 

Nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 or more days past due and restructured loans. Impaired loans do not include purchased loans that were identified upon acquisition as having experienced credit deterioration since origination ( purchased credit impaired loans  or  PCI loans ). We had $102.5 million in nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016, compared with $45.0 million at December 31, 2015. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 3.36% at September 30, 2016 compared with 1.44% at December 31, 2015. 

We generally place a loan on nonaccrual status and cease accruing interest when a loan displays problems that may jeopardize full and timely collection of principal and/or interest, evidenced by one or more of the following: (i) full payment of principal and interest becomes questionable; (ii) the loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest; (iii) the loan is graded as doubtful; (iv) the borrower files bankruptcy and does not reaffirm its indebtedness to us; or (v) foreclosure proceedings are initiated against collateral property. An exception to this is if the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan. 

The following tables present information regarding nonperforming loans at the dates indicated:

Allowance for loan losses 

Our allowance for loan losses is established through charges to income in the form of the provision in order to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under   Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was $35.9 million, representing 1.18% of total loans, excluding loans held for sale, compared with $32.9 million, or 1.05% of total loans, excluding loans held for sale, at December 31, 2015. Loans acquired were recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation methodology. 

The following tables present, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data:

In connection with our review of the loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include: 

for commercial and industrial loans, the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, nature and marketability of collateral;     

for commercial mortgage loans and multifamily residential loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements), operating results of the owner in the case of owner occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type;     

for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of collateral; and     

for construction, land development and other land loans, the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer and loan-to-value ratio.

Table of Contents  

Acquired loans are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the amount and timing of future expected cash flows and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration and the probability that all contractually required payments will not be collected as of the date of acquisition are accounted for in accordance with ASC 310-30, and the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected is considered the non-accretable discount. The non-accretable discount represents the future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. No corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. 		 
		 
			 We believe that the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at September 30, 2016. 

Securities 

We use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2016, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled $318.3 million, an increase of $138 thousand compared with $318.2 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, securities represented 8.1% of total assets compared with 8.4% at December 31, 2015. 

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of securities as of the dates shown:

Table of Contents  

Certain investment securities are valued at less than their historical cost. Management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. 

In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including the severity and the duration of time that the fair value has been less than cost, the credit quality of the issuer and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value. The assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. Securities within the available for sale portfolio may be used as part of our asset and liability management strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest rate risk, prepayment risk or other factors. 

Management does not intend to sell any debt securities classified as held to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell any such debt securities before their anticipated recovery of cost, if a loss currently exists, at which time we expect to receive full value for the securities. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2016, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost, if a loss currently exists. As of September 30, 2016, management believes any impairment in our securities is temporary and no impairment loss has been realized in our consolidated statement of income. We recorded no other than temporary impairment charges in the first nine months of 2016 or the 2015 fiscal year.

Deposits 

Total deposits at September 30, 2016 were $3.3 billion, an increase of $215.2 million or 6.9% compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2015, due primarily to increases in money market accounts, interest bearing transaction accounts and noninterest bearing demand accounts resulting from the Company s deposit attraction and retention initiatives.  Noninterest bearing deposits at September 30, 2016 were $618.4 million compared with $643.4 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $24.9 million or 3.9%. Interest bearing deposits at September 30, 2016 were $2.7 billion an increase of $240.1 million or 9.8% compared with December 31, 2015. 

The Company had $105.2 million and $93.6 million in brokered time deposits, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    Brokered deposits represented 3.2% and 3.0% of total deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 30, 2015, respectively.  The Company utilizes brokered deposits to enhance liquidity.

Other Borrowed Funds 

The following table presents our borrowings at the dates indicated. There were no borrowings outstanding under our arrangement with the Dallas Fed and there were no federal funds purchased outstanding at the dates indicated. 

FHLB advances   We have an available borrowing arrangement with the FHLB, which allows the Company to borrow on a collateralized basis. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total unused borrowing capacity of $603.9 million and $355.1 million, respectively, was available under this arrangement. At September 30, 2016,  $150.0 million was outstanding with an average interest rate of 0.41% and will mature within two years. At December 31, 2015,  $223.3 million was outstanding with an average interest rate of 0.46% and all of the Company s FHLB advances will mature within eight years. These borrowings are collateralized by a blanket lien on certain loans. The increase in total borrowing capacity is due to loan portfolio growth. We utilize these borrowings to meet liquidity needs and to fund certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent the purchase of interests in securities by banking customers. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We do not account for any of our repurchase agreements as sales for accounting purposes in our financial statements. Repurchase agreements with banking customers are settled on the following business day. All securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized by pledged securities. The securities underlying the repurchase agreements are held in safekeeping by the Bank s safekeeping agent.

Dallas Fed   We have an available borrower in custody arrangement with the Dallas Fed, which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis. Certain commercial and consumer loans are pledged under this arrangement. We maintain this borrowing arrangement to meet liquidity needs pursuant to our contingency funding plan. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  $303.8 million and $243.9 million, respectively, were available under this arrangement and no borrowings were outstanding. 

Federal Funds Purchased   We have available federal funds lines of credit with our correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no federal funds purchased outstanding. 

Subordinated Debentures 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding $13.5 million in subordinated debentures net of $8.7 million purchase discount, respectively. On October 1, 2015, the Company acquired Patriot Bancshares, Inc., and assumed the obligations related to the subordinated debentures issued to Patriot Bancshares Capital Trust I and Capital Trust II.  

A summary of pertinent information related to the Company s issues of subordinated debentures outstanding at September 30, 2016 is set forth in the table below: 

(2) 

All debentures are callable five years from issuance date.     

Each of the trusts is a capital trust organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds in the Company s junior subordinated debentures. The preferred trust securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust. The common securities of each trust are wholly owned by the Company. Each trust s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon the Company making payment on the related junior subordinated debentures. The debentures, which are the only assets of each trust, are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company s present and future senior indebtedness. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each trust s obligations under the trust securities issued by such trust to the extent not paid or made by each trust, provided such trust has funds available for such obligations.  		 
		 
			 Under the provisions of each issue of the debentures, the Company has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time to time, for periods not exceeding five years. If interest payments on either issue of the debentures are deferred, the distributions on the applicable trust preferred securities and common securities will also be deferred. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

Liquidity involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the 2015 fiscal year, our liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Although access to brokered deposits, purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight advances from the FHLB and the Dallas Fed are available and have been   

65 

Table of Contents  

utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, we do not generally rely on these external funding sources. We expect capital resources and liquidity will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding $741.1 million in commitments to extend credit and $12.9 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature.     

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $313.4 million, an increase of $188.5 million compared with $124.9 million as of December 31, 2015. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of September 30, 2016 (other than securities sold under repurchase agreements), which consist of our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our certificates and other time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, subordinated debentures, and noncancelable future operating leases. Payments for the Federal Home Loan Bank advances includes interest of $837 thousand that will be paid in future years.  Payments for subordinated debentures includes interest of $12.2 million that will be paid in future years.  The future interest payments were calculated using the current rate in effect at September 30, 2016.  Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts. 

Off Balance Sheet Items 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.

Capital Resources 

Total shareholders  equity was $426.2 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $3.2 million or (0.74%) compared with $429.4 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease was the result of a net loss of $3.5 million for the nine month period, plus the net change for proceeds from the exercise of stock options and an increase in the value of available for sale securities recognized in other accumulated comprehensive earnings and an increase due to stock compensation expense which was offset by Company s treasury stock purchases. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules for the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce CET1, a new capital measure, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 Capital" instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 with certain transition provisions to be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures     As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.  Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 		 
		 
			 Changes in internal control over financial reporting     There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART I  I OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Lega  l Proceedings.  

The Company and the Bank are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  At this time, in the opinion of management, the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved.  In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. 

Item 1  A. Risk Factors.  

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that we believe affect our business and an investment in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, you could experience a partial or complete loss of your investment.  You should read these risks together with the risks detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC as well as any additional risks included in our filings with the SEC. 

As of September 30, 2016, we believe that the following updates should be considered to the risk factors previously disclosed in response to  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

We conduct our operations almost exclusively in Texas which imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting Texas, including any downturn in the energy, technology or real estate sectors. 

69 

Table of Contents  

We conduct our operations almost exclusively in Texas and, as of December 31, 2015, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in Texas. Likewise, as of such date, the substantial majority of our secured loans were secured by collateral located in Texas. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in Texas significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, and any adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. The recent decline in oil prices has negatively impacted economic conditions in these areas, which has impacted our results of operations. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Texas, our existing or prospective borrowers, or property values in our market areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically focused. 		 
		 
			 In addition, the economies in our target markets are highly dependent on the energy sector as well as the technology and real estate sectors. In particular, a further decline in the prices of crude oil or natural gas could adversely affect many of our customers. Any downturn or adverse development in the energy, technology or real estate sectors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We have been adversely affected by the decline in oil prices. 

Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. Furthermore, energy production and related industries represent a large part of the economies in some of our primary markets. As of December 31, 2015, the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $37 compared to approximately $53 as of December 31, 2014 and approximately $98 as of December 31, 2013. While many of our customers have hedged their exposure to oil price changes in the near term, oil prices have caused us to experience increased losses within our energy portfolio. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas. Accordingly, a prolonged period of low oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  As of December 31, 2015, our energy reserve exposure was 4.2% and our energy related service industry exposure was 5.2% of our total funded loans.  As of September 30, 2016, our energy reserve exposure, which included loans held for sale, was 2.1% and our energy related service industry exposure was 3.4% of our total funded loans held for investment plus loans held for sale. 		 
		 
			 We may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends. 

Our strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions. We may not be able to execute on aspects of our growth strategy to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all, whether as a result of regulatory restrictions, the identification of acquisition candidates, the ability to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. More specifically, we may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced portfolio bankers, which could adversely affect our growth. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, we may be unable to maintain our historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 		 
		 
			 We may need to raise additional capital in the future, including to satisfy regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations imposed on us, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected. 

We face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need, or be required by our regulators, to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and supervisory expectations, some of which are subject to change and are beyond our control, and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly,   

70 

Table of Contents  

regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or contract our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Legal and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation, or cause us to adjust our strategy. 

We, like all financial institutions, have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings and are the subject of regulatory investigations and examinations.  We consider most of these proceedings to be in the normal course of business or typical for the industry. However, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters or any requirements or limitations that may be imposed on us as a result thereof. Any material legal or regulatory proceeding, or the results of any regulatory investigation or examination, could impose substantial cost and cause management to divert its attention from our business and operations. Any adverse determination in a legal or regulatory proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Industry and Regulation 

We operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws, regulations and supervisory expectations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us. 

We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the  DIF ), and the overall financial stability of the United States, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. We are subject to confidential regulatory examinations, in which applicable banking regulators make findings regarding our financial condition, safety and soundness, operations and compliance, identify any required corrective actions, and assign supervisory ratings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet supervisory expectations and maintain satisfactory supervisory ratings, particularly in light of the current economic environment in the markets in which we operate and its impact on our recent results of operations.  Our failure to comply with banking laws and regulations and meet supervisory expectations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to further restrictions on our business activities, formal or informal enforcement action, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, ability to conduct acquisitions, the price of our securities and the terms upon which we are able to raise capital. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 		 
		 
			 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was signed into law, and the process of implementation is ongoing. The Dodd Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes on many industries, including ours. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act will ultimately be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear. The legal and regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
