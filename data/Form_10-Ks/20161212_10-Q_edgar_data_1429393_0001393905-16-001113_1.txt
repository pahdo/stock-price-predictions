F-3          BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)         NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         Basis of presentation    The interim financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.       These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and notes thereto included in the Company s 10-K annual report. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.        Principles of consolidation    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bollente Companies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. On May 16, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bollente, Inc.  On the date of acquisition, Bollente, Inc. was 2.78% owned and controlled 100% by Robertson J. Orr, a majority shareholder and officer and director of Bollente Companies, Inc. and the acquisition was accounted for by means of a pooling of the entities from the date of inception of Bollente Companies, Inc. on March 7, 2008 because the entities were under common control. On August 13, 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Bollente International, Inc.  All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.          Use of estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.        Cash and cash equivalents    For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value.        Website    The Company capitalizes the costs associated with the development of the Company s website pursuant to ASC Topic 350.  Other costs related to the maintenance of the website are expensed as incurred.  Amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of 3 years using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. The Company plans to commence amortization upon completion and release of the Company s fully operational website.            F-4          BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)             NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)         Stock-based compensation    The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards.  This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.        The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.        Earnings per share    The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earning per common share ( EPS ) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earning per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.        Inventory    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average cost) or market (net realizable value).          Revenue recognition    The Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable.  The Company records revenue from the sale of product upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer.  The Company also records the shipping income when the products are sent to the customer.        Fair value of financial instruments    Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.       Level 1: The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,  with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market.  Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets.        F-5          BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)             NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)        Level 2: FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist, they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations.       Level 3: If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as  unobservable,  and limits their use by saying they  shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.  This category allows  for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date . Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that  observable inputs  are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants.        NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As a result, the Company incurred accumulated net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of ($20,451,903). In addition, the Company s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through debt and equity financing.       The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.        NOTE 3 - INVENTORY        Inventories consist of the following at:                              F-6          BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)             NOTE 4 - WEBSITE        Website consists of the following at:             Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $17,149 and $14,649, respectively.          NOTE 5 - NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY        Notes payable consist of the following at:                              F-7          BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)             NOTE 5 - NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY (CONTINUED)              Convertible notes payable, net of debt discount consist of the following:             Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $224,819 and $20,799, respectively.  Amortization of debt discount associated with the fair value of the warrants and the $60,624 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Additional financing expense of $889 was recorded for the modification of the warrants to reduce the exercise price from $1.50 to $1.                    F-8          BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)         NOTE 5 - NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY (CONTINUED)         Issuance of warrants        During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we issued warrants to purchase 110,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share to four accredited investors in connection with 12% secured convertible promissory note financing. The warrants are exercisable at any time until five (5) years after the closing date. On August 2, 2016, the Company reduced the warrant exercise price of the warrant holders  warrants from $1.50 to $1.00 per share.         NOTE 6 - ROYALTY PAYMENTS        The Company has agreed to allow accredited investors the ability to receive a royalty on products sold in an effort to fund its distribution and marketing advances internationally by purchasing units.  Each unit represents 0.625% royalty interest in the Gross Margin of product sold by Bollente International, Inc., costing $25,000 per unit. As of September 30, 2016, twenty-eight units have been sold totaling $700,000.  This amount is included in additional paid in capital since there is no obligation to repay the funds.        NOTE 7 - STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY        The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of it $0.001 par value preferred stock and 100,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock.

A partial listing of wholesalers may be found on our website (www.trutankless.com).       Our trutankless  water heaters are designed to provide an endless hot water supply because they are designed to heat water as it flows through the system. We believe that our products are capable of higher temperature rise than competitive units at given flow rates because of its improved design and greater efficiency. Our trutankless  water heaters can save energy and reduce operating costs compared to tank systems because unlike tanks, if there is no hot water demand, no energy is being used. In addition, we intend to improve life-cycle costs with an improved design conceived not only to increase efficiency, but also the longevity of our products versus competitive units. Generally, a typical tank water heater lasts about 11 years, whereas gas tankless systems may last longer, but requires more routine maintenance. Our product line is designed to last longer than tank water heaters without any routine maintenance required under most conditions.       We created a custom heat exchanger for our trutankless  product line that utilizes our patent pending Velix technology to heat water as it flows through the system, which means customers need not worry about running out of hot water. We believe we ve selected the best materials available and a collection of exclusive design elements and features to maximize capacity, minimize energy use, and provide a truly maintenance free experience.

The energy reducing, water-saving truCirc can be used as a standalone product or with our multi-award winning trutankless  electric tankless water heater. truCirc represents the next step in our mission to pioneer forward-thinking technology that changes the way people think about hot water.       A traditional water circulation pump circulates hot water through a home s pipes, enabling homeowners to have instant, on-demand hot water as soon as they turn on the faucet and saving countless gallons of water that would have been wasted. truCirc takes the traditional pump to the next level with multiple hot water delivery strategies including a self-aware learning mode that tracks water usage in a household and predicts when hot water will be needed-- thereby using energy to keep water hot only when it s desired. truCirc s simple, modern, high-tech interface allows homeowners to quickly and easily change delivery modes or choose a zone or fixture to send hot water. Thermostatic shut-off valves can be installed at showerhead points of use throughout a home to further eliminate wasted water.       Our new product, truCirc, was unveiled on January 20, 2015 at the 2015 International Builders  Show in Las Vegas and is still in the development phase. While not yet commercially available, trutankless products are expected to be compatible.

The Company may not have a sufficient amount of cash required to pay all of the costs associated with operating and marketing of its products.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue existence.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        At September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $20,451,903. Primarily because of our history of operating losses and our recording of note payables, we have a working capital deficiency of $535,446 at September 30, 2016.

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activites        The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Quarterly Report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings.       The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:              Operating activities  - Net cash used in operating activities was $993,595 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2,132,872 used in operating activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a higher volume of units sold and decrease in research and development and consulting contract cost.        Investing activities  - Net cash used in investing activities was $3,831 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,250 used in investing activities for the same period in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increase in costs related trademarks.        Financing activities  - Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,036,550, as compared to $2,168,700 for the same period of 2015. The decrease of net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to less equity financing.        Ongoing Funding Requirements        As of September 30, 2016, we continue to use traditional and/or debt financing to provide the capital we need to run the business. It is possible that we may need additional funding to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements.            12             Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we intend to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any of those sources of funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or relationships with third parties when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts; abandon our business strategy of growth through acquisitions; or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements         We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.        Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates        The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.         Changes in internal control over financial reporting         Management reviews the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to the Company s processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that the Company maintains an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities and migrating processes.       During the Company s last fiscal quarter, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.         Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures         In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.                                                                                    14                PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are not presently a party to any material litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us.          Item 1A. Risk Factors        The risk factors listed in our 2015 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on May 9, 2016, are hereby incorporated by reference.          Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.        On August 2, 2016, we agreed to issue 110,000 shares to three lenders to agree to subordinate their debt.  The shares were valued at $110,000.       On August 24, 2016, we issued 35,000 shares of common stock for cash received of $35,000.       On August 24, 2016, we issued 90,000 shares of common stock for services to two consultants totaling $90,000.       On August 26, 2016, we agreed to issue 50,000 shares to a lender to agree to subordinate his debt.  The shares were valued at $50,000.       On August 29, 2016, we sold 20,000 shares of common stock to an investor for cash totaling $20,000 and are recorded to stock payable.  As of the date of this filing, the shares have not been issued.       On September 19, 2016, we issued 80,000 shares of common stock for cash received of $80,000, of which $75,000 of the funds were received as of June 30, 2016 and recorded as stock payable.       On September 19, 2016, we issued 20,000 shares of common stock for services to one consultant totaling $20,000.       On September 27, 2016, we issued 25,000 shares of common stock for services to one consultant totaling $25,000.       On September 27, 2016, we issued 25,000 shares of common stock as part of a loan.  The fair value of the shares was $25,000.       On September 27, 2016, we issued 21,000 shares of common stock owed to two employees of the Company as part of their employment agreement totaling $21,000.       As of September 30, 2016, we recorded a stock payable totaling $60,000 for 60,000 shares of common stock earned by the President of the Company as part of their employment agreement.                15             We believe that the above issuances and sale of the securities was exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of Section 4(2) and Regulation D Rule. The securities were sold directly by us and did not involve a public offering or general solicitation. The recipients of the securities were afforded an opportunity for effective access to files and records of the Registrant that contained the relevant information needed to make their investment decision, including the financial statements and 34 Act reports. We reasonably believed that the recipients, immediately prior to the sale of the securities, were accredited investors and had such knowledge and experience in our financial and business matters that they were capable of evaluating the merits and risks of their investment. The management of the recipients had the opportunity to speak with our management on several occasions prior to their investment decision. There were no commissions paid on the issuance and sale of the securities.         Issuance of Warrants        As of September 30, 2016, we issued warrants to purchase 110,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share to three accredited investors in connection with 12% secured convertible promissory note financing. The warrants are exercisable at any time until five (5) years after the closing date. On August 2, 2016, the Company reduced the warrant exercise price of the warrant holders  warrants from $1.50 to $1.00 per share. The warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering.       On August 2, 2016, we issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share to one accredited investor in connection with loan agreement and security agreement dated August 2, 2016. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part at any time or from time to time on or after August 2, 2016 and until August 1, 2021. The warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering.        Subsequent Issuances         6% Series A Convertible Preferred Securities Purchase Agreement        Subsequent to the period ended September 30, 2016, we sold 33,800 shares of our 6% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock ) to two accredited investors. Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder, into five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at $1.00 per share. All Preferred Stock will be automatically converted into shares of the Company s common stock and warrants after three years from the original issue date of the Preferred Stock.        Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities        We did not repurchase any of our equity securities from the time of our inception on March 7, 2008 through the period ended September 30, 2016.          Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.        None.          Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures        Not applicable.        16                Item 5. Other Information.        None.          Item 6.

 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION

ex-3.1            CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION     OF     SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK     of     BOLLENTE COMPANIES INC.         Establishing the     Voting Powers, Designations, Preferences, Limitations,     Restrictions, and Relative Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock              Bollente Companies Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the Nevada Revised Statutes (hereinafter called the   Corporation  ), hereby certifies that the following resolution was adopted by the board of directors of the Corporation as required by Section 78.195 of the Nevada Revised Statutes at a meeting duly called and held on August 29, 2016;        RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the   Board  ) in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as currently in effect, the Board, by resolutions duly adopted as of August 29, 2016 hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the   Preferred Stock  ), of the Corporation and hereby states the designation and number of shares, and fixes the relative rights, preferences, and limitations thereof as follows:        Series A Convertible Preferred Stock:       Section 1.    Designation and Amount .  A total of 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share, out of the 10,000,000 total Preferred shares authorized in the Corporation Articles of Incorporation, shall be designated  6% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock  (the   Series A Preferred  ).       Section 2.     Dividends . The holders of the Series A Preferred will be entitled to a preferred dividend at the rate of 6% per annum.  Dividends on the Series A Preferred will be cumulative and shall be paid in cash.  Dividends shall be paid annually.       Section 3.    Redemption .       (a)   The Corporation may at any time following the first anniversary from the date of issuance (the   Redemption Date  ), at the option of the Board, redeem in whole or in part the Series A Preferred by paying in cash in exchange for the Series A Preferred to be redeemed a sum equal to $3.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such Series A Preferred), (the   Redemption Price  ). Any redemption affected pursuant to this provision shall be made on a pro rata basis among the holders of the Series A Preferred in proportion to the number of Series A Preferred then held by them.            1             (b)   Subject to the rights of series of preferred stock which may from time to time come into existence, at least ten (10) but no more than sixty (60) days prior to each Redemption Date, written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the Series A Preferred to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of this Corporation for such holder, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to this Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the Series A Preferred to be redeemed (the   Redemption Notice  ). On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of Series A Preferred to be redeemed shall surrender to this Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the event less than all the Series A Preferred represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed Series A Preferred.       (c)   From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred designated for redemption in the Redemption Notice as holders of Series A Preferred (except the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such Series A Preferred, and such Series A Preferred shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. Subject to the rights of series of preferred stock which may from time to time come into existence, if the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of Series A Preferred on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the total number of Series A Preferred to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such Series A Preferred ratably among the holders of such Series A Preferred to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Series A Preferred. The Series A Preferred not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. Subject to the rights of series of preferred stock which may from time to time come into existence, at any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Series A Preferred, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the Series A Preferred which the Corporation has become obliged to redeem on any Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed.                    2             Section 4.    Conversion . The holder of the Series A Preferred shall have conversion rights as follows (the " Conversion Rights "):       (a)    Optional Conversion: Right to Convert . Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred, into five (5) shares of the Corporation s common stock, $0.001 par value per share and a five year warrant to purchase one (1) share of the Corporation s common stock at $1.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares).       (b)    Automatic Conversion . Each share of Series A Preferred shall be converted automatically into the number of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred are convertible pursuant to this Section 4, without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, on August 29, 2019.       (c)    Mechanics of Conversion . Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefore, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.        (d)    No Impairment . The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against impairment.                    3             (e)    Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation.        Section 5.    Liquidation Preference.        (a)    In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, subject to the rights of series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, the holders of Series A Preferred shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of this Corporation to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of $3.00 per Share for each outstanding Share, being referred to herein as the   Premium  ). If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then, subject to the rights of series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.        (b)   Upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a) above and any other distribution that may be required with respect to series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred and Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each (assuming conversion of all such Series A Preferred).       (i)   For purposes of this provision, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but, excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Corporation);                4             or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation;  unless  the Corporation s shareholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such acquisition or sale will, immediately after such acquisition or sale (by virtue of securities issued as consideration for the Corporation s acquisition or sale or otherwise) hold at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity.       (ii)    In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:       (A)   Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability (covered by (B) below):       (1)   If traded on a securities exchange (NASDAQ, AMEX, NYSE, etc.), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;       (2)    If traded on a quotation system, such as the OTC Markets, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and       (3)   If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.       (B)   The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a shareholder s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Preferred Stock.       (iii)   In the event the requirements of this provision are not complied with, this Corporation shall forthwith either:       (A)   cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the requirements of this provision have been complied with; or                5             (B)   cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series A Preferred shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in subsection 3(c)(iv) hereof.       (iv)   The Corporation shall give each holder of record of Series A Preferred written notice of such impending transaction not later than ten (10) days prior to the shareholders  meeting called to approve such transaction, or ten (10) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 3, and the Corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Series A Preferred that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Series A Preferred.       Section 6.    VOTING RIGHTS .  Except as described in Section 7 below, the holder of each Share shall not have any voting rights, except in the case of voting on a change in the preferences of Series A Preferred.       Section 7.    PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS . So long as any Series A Preferred are outstanding, this Corporation shall not without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series A Preferred which is entitled, other than solely by law, to vote with respect to the matter, and which Series A Preferred represents at least two-thirds of the voting power of the then outstanding Series A Preferred:       (a)   sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of or encumber all or substantially all of its property or business or merge into or consolidate with any other corporation (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation) or effect any transaction or series of related transactions in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the Corporation is disposed of;       (b)   alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A Preferred so as to affect adversely the Series A Preferred;       (c)   increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock;                6             (d)   authorize or issue, or obligate itself to issue, any other equity security, including any other security convertible into or exercisable for any equity security (i) having a preference over, or being on a parity with, the Series A Preferred with respect to dividends or upon liquidation, or (ii) having rights similar to any of the rights of the Preferred Stock; or       (e)   amend the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation or bylaws.           In WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned hereby declares and certifies that this Certificate of Designation is executed on behalf of the Corporation as of this 31 st  day of August, 2016.       Corporation:   Bollente Companies Inc           By:  /s/ Robertson J. Orr    Robertson J.
