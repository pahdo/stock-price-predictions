  1. General 
  The terms  we,   our,   us  and  Spectra Energy Partners  as used in this report refer collectively to Spectra Energy Partners, LP and its subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise. These terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any separate legal entity within Spectra Energy Partners. 
  Nature of Operations.   Spectra Energy Partners, through its subsidiaries and equity affiliates, is engaged in the transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas and the transportation and storage of crude oil through interstate pipeline systems. We are a Delaware master limited partnership. As of   September 30, 2016  , Spectra Energy Corp (Spectra Energy) and its subsidiaries collectively owned   76%   of us and the remaining   24%   was publicly owned. 
  On September 6, 2016, Spectra Energy announced that they entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge). Under this agreement, Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy's stock at approximately   $28 billion  , based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares as of   September 2, 2016  . This transaction was unanimously approved by both boards of directors, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to shareholder and certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. 
  Upon completion of the proposed merger, Spectra Energy shareholders will receive   0.984   Enbridge common shares for each share of Spectra Energy stock they own. The consideration to be received is valued at   $40.33   per Spectra Energy share, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares as of   September 2, 2016  , representing an approximate   11.5%   premium to the closing price of Spectra Energy stock as of   September 2, 2016  . Upon completion of the merger, Enbridge shareholders are expected to own approximately   57%   of the combined company and Spectra Energy shareholders are expected to own approximately   43%  .  
  As a result of this transaction, Enbridge and its subsidiaries will collectively own the interest in us currently held by Spectra Energy.  
  Basis of Presentation.   The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to fairly present our results of operations and financial position. Amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods. 
  Spectra Energy and its affiliates are solely responsible for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. Our costs of doing business have been reflected in our financial accounting records for the periods presented. These costs include direct charges and allocations from Spectra Energy and its affiliates for business services, such as payroll, accounts payable and facilities management; corporate services, such as finance and accounting, legal, human resources, investor relations, public and regulatory policy, and senior executives; and pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. 
  Use of Estimates.   To conform with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these estimates are based on our best available knowledge at the time, actual results could differ.

2. Business Segments 
  We manage our business in   two   reportable segments: U.S. Transmission and Liquids. The remainder of our business operations is presented as  Other,  and consists of certain corporate costs. 
  Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about both segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. There is no aggregation of segments within our reportable business segments. 
  The U.S. Transmission segment provides interstate transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas. Substantially all of our operations are subject to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Transportation s (DOT s) rules and regulations. Our investments in Gulfstream Natural Gas System, LLC (Gulfstream), Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH) and Steckman Ridge, LP are included in U.S. Transmission.  
  The Liquids segment provides transportation of crude oil. The Express-Platte pipeline system (Express-Platte) is a crude oil pipeline system that connects Canadian and U.S. producers to refineries in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions. These operations are primarily subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC and the National Energy Board (NEB). We held direct one-third ownership interests in DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (Southern Hills) until October 30, 2015. 
  Our reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately as business units. Management evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Cash, cash equivalents and investments are managed centrally, so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement, and interest and dividend income, are excluded from the segments  EBITDA. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.

3. Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit and Cash Distributions 
  The following table presents our net income per limited partner unit calculations: 

Our partnership agreement requires that, within   60 days   after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our Available Cash, as defined, to unitholders of record on the applicable record date. 
  Available Cash.   Available Cash, for any quarter, consists of all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of that quarter: 
             
    less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner to: 
                
    provide for the proper conduct of business, 
                
    comply with applicable law, any debt instrument or other agreement, or 
                
    provide funds for minimum quarterly distributions to the unitholders and to the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters, 
                
    plus, if the general partner so determines, all or a portion of cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of Available Cash for the quarter. 
     Incentive Distribution Rights.   The general partner holds incentive distribution rights beyond the first target distribution in accordance with the partnership agreement as follows: 

To the extent these incentive distributions are made to the general partner, there will be more Available Cash proportionately allocated to our general partner than to holders of common units. A cash distribution of   $0.67625   per limited partner unit was declared on   November 2, 2016   and is payable on   November 29, 2016   to unitholders of record at the close of business on   November 14, 2016  . 
  There is a reduction in the aggregate quarterly distributions, if any, to Spectra Energy, (as holder of incentive distribution rights), by   $4 million   per quarter for a period of 12 consecutive quarters ending on September 30, 2018 as a result of the sale of our interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills to Spectra Energy.

4. Transaction with Affiliate 
  During the third quarter of 2015, Gulfstream issued unsecured debt of   $800 million   to fund the repayment of its current debt. Gulfstream distributed   $396 million  , our proportionate share of proceeds, to us of which we contributed   $248 million   back to Gulfstream in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the remaining   $148 million  , classified as Cash Flow from Investing Activities   Distribution to Equity Investment, in the second quarter of 2016. 
   
  5. Variable Interest Entities 
  Sabal Trail.   On April 1, 2016, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra) purchased a   9.5%   interest in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) from us. Consideration for this transaction consisted of approximately   $110 million   cash,   $102 million   of which is classified as Cash Flows from Financing Activities   Contributions from Noncontrolling Interests. See Note 6 for additional information related to this transaction. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   50%   interest in Sabal Trail, a joint venture that is constructing a natural gas pipeline to transport natural gas to Florida. Sabal Trail is a variable interest entity (VIE) due to insufficient equity at risk to finance its activities. We determined that we are the primary beneficiary because we direct the activities of Sabal Trail that most significantly impact its economic performance and we consolidate Sabal Trail in our financial statements. The current estimate of the total remaining construction cost is approximately   $1.5 billion  . 
  The following summarizes assets and liabilities for Sabal Trail:    

  Nexus.   We own a   50%   interest in Nexus Gas Transmission, LLC (Nexus), a joint venture that is constructing a natural gas pipeline from Ohio to Michigan and continuing on to Ontario, Canada. Nexus is a VIE due to insufficient equity at risk to finance its activities. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary because the power to direct the activities of Nexus that most significantly impact its economic performance is shared. We account for Nexus under the equity method. Our maximum exposure to loss is   $1.0 billion  . We have an investment in Nexus of   $281 million   and   $90 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, classified as Investments in and Loans to Unconsolidated Affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   
  6. Intangible Asset 
  During the first quarter of 2016 we entered into a project coordination agreement (PCA) with NextEra, Duke Energy Corporation and Williams Partners L.P. In accordance with the agreement, payments will be made, based on our proportional ownership interest in the Sabal Trail project, as certain milestones of the project are met. During the first quarter of 2016, the first milestone was achieved and paid, consisting of   $48 million  .  
  On April 1, 2016, NextEra purchased an additional   9.5%   interest in Sabal Trail, reducing our ownership interest in Sabal Trail to   50%  . Upon purchase of the additional ownership interest, NextEra reimbursed us   $8 million   for NextEra s proportional share of the first milestone payment, which reduced our total milestone payments to   $40 million   as of June 30, 2016.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, the second milestone was achieved and paid, consisting of an additional payment of   $40 million  , for total milestone payments of   $80 million   as of September 30, 2016. Both payments are classified as Cash Flows from Investing Activities   Purchase of Intangible, Net. This PCA is an intangible asset and is classified as Investments and Other Assets   Other on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The intangible asset will be amortized over a period of   25   years beginning at the time of in-service of Sabal Trail, which is expected to occur during the first half of 2017.

7. Goodwill 
  We perform our goodwill impairment test annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2016 and no impairments were identified. 
  We perform our annual review for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our reportable segments. 
  As permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management s judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts. 
   
  8. Marketable Securities and Restricted Funds 
  We routinely invest excess cash and various restricted balances in securities such as commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and other money market securities in the United States, as well as equity securities in Canada. We do not purchase marketable securities for speculative purposes, therefore we do not have any securities classified as trading securities. While we do not routinely sell marketable securities prior to their scheduled maturity dates, some of our investments may be held and restricted for the purposes of funding future capital expenditures and NEB regulatory requirements, so these investments are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) marketable securities as they may occasionally be sold prior to their scheduled maturity dates due to the unexpected timing of cash needs. Initial investments in securities are classified as purchases of the respective type of securities (AFS marketable securities or held-to-maturity (HTM) marketable securities). Maturities of securities are classified within proceeds from sales and maturities of securities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
  AFS Securities.   We had   $15 million     and     $11 million   of AFS securities classified as Investments and Other Assets   Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , these investments include   $14 million   of restricted funds related to certain construction projects and   $1 million   are restricted funds held and collected from customers for Canadian pipeline abandonment in accordance with the NEB's regulatory requirements. The balance as of   December 31, 2015   is all related to certain construction projects. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average contractual maturity of outstanding AFS securities was less than   one year  . 
  There were   no   material gross unrecognized holding gains or losses associated with investments in AFS securities at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  HTM Securities.   All of our HTM securities are restricted funds. We had   $8 million   and   $3 million   of money market securities classified as Current Assets   Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These securities are restricted pursuant to certain Express-Platte debt agreements. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average contractual maturity of outstanding HTM securities was less than   one year  . 
  There were   no   material gross unrecognized holding gains or losses associated with investments in HTM securities at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Other Restricted Funds.   In addition to the AFS and HTM securities that were restricted funds as described above, we had other restricted funds totaling   $7 million   and   $14 million   classified as Investments and Other Assets   Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These restricted funds are related to certain construction projects. 
  Changes in restricted balances are presented within Cash Flows from Investing Activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

9. Debt and Credit Facility 
  Available Credit Facility and Restricted Debt Covenants 

On April 29, 2016, we amended our credit agreement. The total capacity was increased to   $2.5 billion   and the expiration date was extended to April 2021. 
  The issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amount available under the credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.  
  Our credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the agreements. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, our credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of our other significant indebtedness or other significant indebtedness of some of our subsidiaries. Our debt and credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations. 
  As noted above, the terms of our credit agreements require us to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to-Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, of   5.0   to 1 or less. As of   September 30, 2016  , this ratio was   3.7   to 1.

Level 2 Valuation Techniques 
  Fair values of our financial instruments that are actively traded in the secondary market, including our long-term debt, are determined based on market-based prices. These valuations may include inputs such as quoted market prices of the exact or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources that may include models or matrix pricing tools, with reasonable levels of price transparency. 
  For interest rate swaps, we utilize data obtained from a third-party source for the determination of fair value. Both the future cash flows for the fixed-leg and floating-leg of our swaps are discounted to present value. 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques 
  Level 3 valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques where at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial instruments also include those for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Financial Instruments 
  The fair values of financial instruments that are recorded and carried at book value are summarized in the following table. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could have realized in current markets. 

________  
           (a) 
    Included within Investments in and Loans to Unconsolidated Affiliates. 
              (b) 
    Excludes commercial paper, unamortized items and fair value hedge carrying value adjustments. 
     The fair value of our long-term debt is determined based on market-based prices as described in the Level 2 valuation technique described above and is classified as Level 2. 
  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, note receivable-noncurrent, accounts payable, commercial paper and short-term money market securities are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments or because the stated rates approximate market rates. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , there were no material adjustments to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
   
  11. Risk Management and Hedging Activities 
  Changes in interest rates expose us to risk as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We are exposed to foreign currency risk from the Canadian portion of Express-Platte. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include the use of derivatives, mostly around interest rate exposures. For interest rate derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were   no   significant amounts of gains or losses recognized in net income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had    pay floating   receive fixed  interest rate swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of   $900 million   to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates  . These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.

12. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Environmental 
  We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on us.  
  Like others in the energy industry, we and our affiliates are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites. These include some properties that are part of our ongoing operations, sites formerly owned or used by us, and sites owned by third parties. Remediation typically involves management of contaminated soils and may involve groundwater remediation. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state/provincial and local agencies, activities vary with site conditions and locations, remedial requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve statutory joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, we or our affiliates could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other parties. In some instances, we may share liability associated with contamination with other potentially responsible parties, and may also benefit from contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. All of these sites generally are managed in the normal course of business or affiliated operations.  
  Litigation 
  Litigation and Legal Proceedings.   We are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings in various forums arising in the ordinary course of business, including matters regarding contract and payment claims, some of which involve substantial monetary amounts. We have insurance coverage for certain of these losses should they be incurred. We believe that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  Legal costs related to the defense of loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. We had no material reserves for legal matters recorded as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   related to litigation. 
   
  13. Issuances of Common Units 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued   10.4 million   common units to the public under our at-the-market program, and approximately   212,000   general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were   $483 million  , including approximately   $10 million   of proceeds from Spectra Energy. 
  In April 2016, we issued   10.4 million   common units and   0.2 million   general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction. Total net proceeds were   $489 million  , including   $10 million   for general partner units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's   2%   general partner interest. We used the proceeds from this purchase for general partnership purposes, including the funding of our current expansion capital plan. 
   
  14. New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10,    Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation,    which amends the consolidation guidance around reporting entities that invest in development stage entities. We adopted the consolidation guidance of this amendment on January 1, 2016 and applied it retrospectively with no material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. This ASU did result in certain of our entities being classified as VIE. See Note 5 for discussion of our Variable Interest Entities.  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents   

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,    which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. These changes required reevaluation of certain entities for consolidation and required us to revise our documentation regarding the consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 with no material effect on our consolidated operations, financial position, or cash flows.  
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,    Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  ,      to simplify accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and to eliminate the retrospective accounting for those adjustments. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, and it has not had a material impact on our consolidated operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842),    to improve the financial reporting around leasing transactions. The new guidance requires companies to begin recording assets and liabilities arising from those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. Furthermore, the new guidance will require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in previous guidance. The result of retaining a distinction between finance leases and operating leases is that under the lessee accounting model in Topic 842, the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous guidance. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,    which clarifies the hedge accounting impact when there is a change in one of the counterparties to the derivative contract (i.e. novation). This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments,    which simplifies the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,    Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,    which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. This ASU is effective for us January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),    to clarify implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,    to clarify implementation guidance on performance obligations and licensing. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ,      to clarify implementation guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ,      to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires the consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,"   to provide guidance on specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating this ASU and its potential impact on us.

15. Subsequent Events 
  On October 17, 2016 we issued   $800 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of   $600 million   of   3.375%   senior notes due in   2026   and   $200 million   of   4.50%   senior notes due in   2045  . The new   2045   notes are an additional issuance of our   4.50%   senior notes issued in March 2015. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

INTRODUCTION 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we reported net income from controlling interests of $  275 million   and $  321 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we reported net income from controlling interests of $  860 million   and $  921 million  , respectively.  
  The highlights for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   included increased earnings driven by expansion, primarily at Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern), more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania, and the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills which we owned until October 2015. The highlights for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included increased earnings driven by expansion, more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania, lower interruptible and short-term firm transportation revenue, a one-time property tax accrual adjustment in 2015, and the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills. 
  For both of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , distributable cash flow was   $270 million  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , distributable cash flow was   $916 million   and   $945 million  , respectively. 
  A cash distribution of   $0.67625   per limited partner unit was declared on   November 2, 2016   and is payable on   November 29, 2016  . We intend to increase our quarterly distribution by one and a quarter cents per unit each quarter through 2018. Our Board of Directors evaluates each distribution decision within the confines of the Partnership agreement and based on an assessment of growth in distributable cash flow. 
  We are conducting an assessment of the Texas Eastern system across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The assessment is the result of a corrective action order from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) as well as our own work plan related to an incident on the system on April 29, 2016 near Delmont, Pennsylvania. This assessment program and the related system repairs are expected to cost approximately $75 million to $100 million. Most of this program will be completed in 2016, with the remainder of the work to be performed in 2017. Additional inspections and repairs, if any, will be determined after the completion of this work. Importantly, as of November 1, 2016 we were in the position to fully meet our customer obligations. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,727 million   of capital and investment expenditures. We currently project $2.5 billion of capital and investment expenditures for the full year, including expansion capital expenditures of $2.2 billion. These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests. 
    
  We are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuances of debt and equity securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility which is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program. 
    
  On September 6, 2016, Spectra Energy announced that they entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge. Under this agreement, Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy's stock at approximately $28 billion, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares as of September 2, 2016. This transaction was unanimously approved by both boards of directors, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to shareholder and certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. 
  
   20 

     Table of Contents   

Upon completion of the proposed merger, Spectra Energy shareholders will receive 0.984 Enbridge common shares for each share of Spectra Energy stock they own. The consideration to be received is valued at $40.33 per Spectra Energy share, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares as of September 2, 2016, representing an approximate 11.5% premium to the closing price of Spectra Energy stock as of September 2, 2016. Upon completion of the merger, Enbridge shareholders are expected to own approximately 57% of the combined company and Spectra Energy shareholders are expected to own approximately 43%.  
  As a result of this transaction, Enbridge and its subsidiaries will collectively own the interest in us currently held by Spectra Energy.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Same Period in 2015 
  Operating Revenues.   The $16 million increase was driven mainly by: 
             
    revenues from expansion, primarily on Texas Eastern, and 
                
    storage revenues due to new contracts at higher rates, partially offset by 
                
    lower processing revenues due mainly to lower volumes, net of higher prices, 
                
    lower crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of lower Platte pipeline volumes, net of increased tariff rates primarily on the Express pipeline, and 
                
    lower recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers. 
     Operating Expenses.   The $55 million increase was driven mainly by: 
             
    pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania,  
                
    higher costs related to expansion, and 
                
    higher property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit, partially offset by  
                
    lower maintenance costs on the Express and Platte pipelines, and 
                
    lower electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers. 
     Earnings from Equity Investments  . The $14 million decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills owned until October 2015. 
  Other Income and Expenses, Net.     The $15 million increase was primarily attributable to higher allowance for funds used 
  during construction (AFUDC) from higher capital spending on expansion projects. 
  Interest Expense.     The $6 million decrease was mainly due to higher capitalized interest. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Same Period in 2015 
  Operating Revenues.   The $49 million increase was driven mainly by: 
             
    higher revenues from expansion, primarily on Texas Eastern, and 
                
    storage revenues due to new contracts at higher rates, partially offset by 
                
    lower natural gas transportation revenues mainly from interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. (M N U.S.) and short-term firm transportation primarily on Algonquin Gas Transmission, L.L.C. (Algonquin), 
     
   22 

     Table of Contents   

lower recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, 
                
    lower processing revenues primarily due to lower prices and volumes, and 
                
    lower crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of lower volumes on the Platte and Express pipelines, substantially 
     offset by increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline. 
  Operating Expenses.   The $92 million increase was driven mainly by: 
             
    pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania,  
                
    higher costs related to expansion,  
                
    higher property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit, and 
                
    higher operating costs, partially offset by  
                
    lower  power costs due to lower usage in 2016 and lower maintenance costs on the Express and Platte pipeline, 
                
    lower electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, and   
                
    a prior year non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, L.L.C. (Ozark Gas Gathering). 
     Earnings from Equity Investments  . The $42 million decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills owned until October 2015. 
  Other Income and Expenses, Net.     The $40 million increase was primarily attributable to higher AFUDC from higher capital spending on expansion projects. 
  Interest Expense.     The $14 million decrease was mainly due to higher capitalized interest, partially offset by higher average balances of long term debt. 
  Segment Results 
  Management evaluates segment performance based on EBITDA transactions. Cash, cash equivalents and investments are managed centrally, so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement, and interest and dividend income, are excluded from the segments  EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment s operating performance from its continuing operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.  
  Segment EBITDA is summarized in the following table. Detailed discussions follow.  
  EBITDA by Business Segment 

The amounts discussed below are after eliminating intercompany transactions.

Distributable Cash Flow 
  We define Distributable Cash Flow as EBITDA plus  
             
    distributions from equity investments, 
                
    other non-cash items affecting net income, less  
                
    earnings from equity investments, 
                
    interest expense,  
                
    equity AFUDC, 
                
    net cash paid for income taxes, 
                
    distributions to noncontrolling interests, and 
                
    maintenance capital expenditures. 
     Distributable Cash Flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Distributable Cash Flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we plan to distribute for a given period. 
  Distributable Cash Flow is the primary financial measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements to assess the amount of cash that is available for distribution.  
  Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to Net Income, Operating Income, cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect Net Income and Operating Income and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, Distributable Cash Flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
  Significant drivers of variances in Distributable Cash Flow between the periods presented are substantially the same as those previously discussed under Results of Operations. Other drivers include the timing of certain cash outflows, such as capital expenditures for maintenance.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Test 
  As permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management s judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts. 
  In connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units  revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections. 
  We performed either a quantitative assessment or a qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of these reporting units are less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill as of April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date). Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, no indicators of impairment were noted and the fair values of the reporting units that we assessed at April 1, 2016 were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.  
  No triggering events have occurred with our reporting units since the April 1, 2016 test that would warrant re-testing for goodwill impairment.  
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had negative working capital of $1,500 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $1,177 million and current maturities of long-term debt of $422 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity affiliates, and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for the next 12 months. We have access to a revolving credit facility, with available capacity of   $1,323 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This facility is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program, which is used to manage working capital requirements and for temporary funding of capital expenditures. We expect to be self-funding and plan to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years. Capital resources may continue to include commercial paper, short-term borrowings under our current credit facility and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity. See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the available credit facility and Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity for a discussion of effective shelf registrations. 
  Cash Flow Analysis 
  The following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:    

  Operating Cash Flows 
  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $60 million to   $1,070 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , driven mainly by the absence of distributions from Sand Hills and Southern Hills owned until October 2015. 
  
   29 

     Table of Contents   

Investing Cash Flows 
  Net cash used in investing activities increased $1,079 million to $  1,914 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The change was mainly driven by: 
             
    a $475 million increase in capital and investment expenditures,  
                
    a $396 million distribution received from Gulfstream with proceeds from a Gulfstream debt offering in 2015, and 
                
    a $148 million distribution of the debt proceeds back to Gulfstream for payment of its matured debt in 2016. 
     Capital and Investment Expenditures by Business Segment 

Capital and investment expenditures for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consisted of $1,549 million for expansion projects and $178 million for maintenance and other projects.  
  We project 2016 capital and investment expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion of expansion capital expenditures and $0.3 billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants, pipelines and infrastructure to serve growth. These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests. 
  Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity 
  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $1,041 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $144 million   used in financing activities in the same period in   2015  . The change was mainly driven by: 
              
    a $614 million increase in proceeds from issuances of units, and 
                
    a $273 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by 
                 
    a $251 million increase in payments for the redemption of long-term debt. 
     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued   10.4 million   common units to the public under our at-the-market program and approximately   212,000   general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were   $483 million  ,   including approximately   $10 million   of proceeds from Spectra Energy. The net proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, which may have included debt repayment, capital expenditures and/or additions to working capital. In 2016, we have issued 10.9 million common units to the public under our at-the-market program and approximately 222,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy, for total net proceeds of approximately $503 million, including $10 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy. 
  In April 2016, we issued 10.4 million common units and 0.2 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction. Total net proceeds were approximately $489 million. We used the net proceeds from this purchase for general partnership purposes, including the funding of our current expansion capital plan.  
  Available Credit Facility and Restrictive Debt Covenants.   See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the available credit facility and related financial and other covenants. 
  Cash Distributions.   A cash distribution of   $0.67625   per limited partner unit was declared on   November 2, 2016  , payable on   November 29, 2016  , representing the thirty-sixth consecutive quarterly increase. 
  Debt Issuances.   On October 17, 2016 we issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $600 million of 3.375% senior notes due in 2026 and $200 million of 4.50% senior notes due in 2045. The new 2045 notes are an additional issuance of our 4.50% senior notes issued in March 2015. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.

Other Financing Matters.   We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register the issuance of unspecified amounts of limited partner common units and various debt securities and another registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of $1 billion, in the aggregate, of limited partner units over time. This registration has $466 million available as of   September 30, 2016  .

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of Spectra Energy Partners (DE) GP, LP (our General Partner), including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  , and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our General Partner, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and found no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
