Note
1 - Business Organization and Nature of Operations   

BTCS
Inc. (formerly Bitcoin Shop, Inc.), a Nevada Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated in 2008. In February 2014,
the Company entered the business of hosting an online ecommerce marketplace where consumers can purchase merchandise using digital
currencies, including bitcoin and is currently focused on blockchain and digital currency ecosystems. In January 2015, the Company
began a rebranding campaign using its BTCS.COM domain (shorthand for Blockchain Technology Consumer Solutions) to better reflect
its broadened strategy. The Company released its new website which included broader information on its strategy. In late 2014
we shifted our focus towards our transaction verification service business, also known as bitcoin mining, though in mid 2016 we
ceased our transaction verification services operation at our North Carolina facility due to capital constraints. Although our
ecommerce marketplace is still online we are no longer developing, marketing or supporting it.  

On
July 20, 2016, BTCS Digital Manufacturing ( DM ), a wholly owned subsidiary the Company suspended its North Carolina
transaction verification services facility operations. The recent reduction in the block reward from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins,
often referred to as the halving, coupled with the facilities cooling system failing, has resulted in DM being unable to meet
certain of its financial commitments. The Company has subsequently ceased operations at DM.  

On
August 8, 2016, DM discovered that its facility in North Carolina was broken into and certain of its equipment and approximately
165 Bitmain transaction verification servers leased from CSC Leasing Company ( CSC ) were stolen. The value of the
stolen equipment owned by the Company does not appear to be material. The Company reported the theft to local authorities as well
its insurance company regarding next steps. The Company is currently working through the insurance company claims process for
the benefit of CSC the Company s equipment finance provider which owns the stolen serves. CSC would be the payee with respect
to any insurance proceeds received in connection with the stolen servers.  

The
Company is an early entrant in the digital currency market and one of the first U.S. publicly traded companies to be involved
with digital currencies and blockchain technologies. Subject to additional financing, the Company plans to create a portfolio
of digital assets including bitcoin and other  protocol tokens  to provide investors a diversified pure-play exposure
to the bitcoin and blockchain industries. The Company intends to acquire digital assets through: open market purchases, participating
in initial digital asset offerings (often referred to as initial coin offerings). Additionally the Company may acquire digital
assets by resuming its transaction verification services business through outsourced data centers and earning rewards in digital
assets by securing their respective blockchains.  

Note
2 - Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q
and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, since they are interim statements, the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements, but reflect
all adjustments consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, that are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. In the opinion of the Company s management, all
adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position
and the results of operations for the periods presented have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Note
3 - Liquidity, Financial Condition and Management s Plans   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a net loss of approximately $26.9 million and
a net loss of approximately $8.4 million, respectively. The Company had no cash and cash equivalents outstanding and a working
capital deficiency of approximately $24.3 million at September 30, 2016, which includes $20 million for the fair
value of derivative liabilities. The Company expects to incur losses into the foreseeable future as it undertakes its efforts
to execute its business plans.  

The
Company will require significant additional capital to sustain its short-term operations and make the investments it needs to
execute its longer term business plan. The Company s existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated
capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. The Company is currently seeking to obtain additional debt or equity financing,
however there are currently no commitments in place for further financing nor is there any assurance that such financing will
be available to the Company on favorable terms, if at all.  

Because
of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, there is substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not made adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements to reflect the potential effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or liabilities should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.  

BTCS
Inc. and Subsidiaries   

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

The
Company continues to incur ongoing administrative and other operating expenses, including public company expenses, in excess of
revenues. While the Company continues to implement its business strategy, it intends to finance its activities by:  

managing
    current cash and cash equivalents on hand from the Company s past debt and equity offerings, by controlling costs, and   

seeking
    additional financing through sales of additional securities.   

In
    order to raise capital, the Company needs to increase its authorized Common Stock. On December 16, 2016, the Company filed
    a preliminary Information Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing it has obtained approval from its
    shareholders to effect a reverse stock split and maintain the number of authorized shares of Common Stock at current levels.
    The consent was executed by the Company s CEO as the holder of super voting preferred stock. See Note 13.   

Note
4 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

A
summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements is as follows:  

Transaction
Verification Services   

Revenue
earned from bitcoin processing activities ( Transaction Verification Services ), commonly termed  mining 
activities, is recognized at the fair value of the bitcoins received as consideration on the date of actual receipt.  

The
Company generates revenue by performing computer processing activities for bitcoin generation. In the digital-currency industry
such activity is generally referred to as Transaction Verification Services or bitcoin mining. The Company receives consideration
for performing such transaction verification activities in the form of bitcoins. Revenue is recorded upon the actual receipt of
bitcoins.  

Expenses
consist of utilities paid to cover our electric costs, rent for our facility and personnel to run our facility. The expenses related
to our Transaction Verification Services activities are affected by the level of activities and not the ultimate generation of
bitcoins. The Company expenses these costs as they are incurred.  

Net
Loss per Share   

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period.  

For
purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share, vested restricted stock awards are considered outstanding. Under
the treasury stock method, diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other instruments
that are convertible into common stock were exercised or could result in the issuance of common stock. The following financial
instruments were not included in the diluted loss per share calculation as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 because their effect
was anti-dilutive:

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . ASU
No. 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifies
the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment
to identify impairment; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions
used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance
sheet; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for
disclosure purposes; requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in
the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure
the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; requires separate presentation
of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the
accompanying notes to the financial statements and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance
on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.
ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU No. 2016-01 will have on its condensed consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842) which supersedes FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases (Topic 840)
and provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.
The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on
the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine
whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease,
respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater
than twelve months regardless of classification. Leases with a term of twelve months or less will be accounted for similar to
existing guidance for operating leases. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2018, with early adoption permitted upon issuance. When adopted, the Company does not expect this guidance to have a material
impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue  from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations .
The purpose of ASU No. 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. For public
entities, the amendments in ASU No. 2016-08 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-08 on its condensed consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting . Under ASU No. 2016-09, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies
in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ). Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as
income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the APIC pools will be eliminated. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminates
the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them. ASU No. 2016-09 also requires companies
to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. Furthermore,
ASU No. 2016-09 will increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception
to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. An employer
with a statutory income tax withholding obligation will now be allowed to withhold shares with a fair value up to the amount of
taxes owed using the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee s applicable jurisdiction(s). ASU No. 2016-09 requires a
company to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding
obligation as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Under current U.S. GAAP, it was not specified how these cash
flows should be classified. In addition, companies will now have to elect whether to account for forfeitures on share-based payments
by (1) recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or (2) estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting
the estimate when it is likely to change, as is currently required. The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The
Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customer . The new guidance is an update to ASC
606 and provides clarity on: identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. For public companies, ASU No. 2016-10
is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU No. 2016-10 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,
which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including
adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement on its condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows.

Subsequent
events have been evaluated through the date of this filing.  

Note
5 - Property and Equipment   

Property
and equipment consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Depreciation
expense was approximately $0 and $88,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $177,000 and
$202,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased fixed assets of approximately $19,000, sold fixed assets amounting
to approximately $57,000, resulting in loss on sale of fixed assets of $11,000.  

Due
to the financial nature of the Company, the Company impaired all fixed assets and recorded an approximately $241,000 impairment
charge in June 2016.  

Note
6 - Investment at Cost   

Spondoolies   

The
Company had total investment of approximately $2.3 million to Spondoolies Tech Ltd. ( Spondoolies ) as of December
31, 2015.  

On
May 5, 2016, the Company was informed that, on May 4, 2016, a hearing was held in the district court in Beersheva, Israel during
which certain parties sought appointment of a temporary liquidator for Spondoolies. As a result of the liquidation the Company
is no longer pursuing the acquisition of Spondoolies. The Company assessed impairment for the Spondoolies investment and determined
that this investment is not recoverable and as such fully impaired.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded impairment loss of approximately $2.3 million.  

Note
7 - Fair Value Measurements   

The
Company s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy.  

BTCS
Inc. and Subsidiaries   

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

The
following table presents information about the Company s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the
Company s estimated level within the fair value hierarchy of those assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:  

There
were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Both observable and
unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category.
As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair
value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable
long-dated volatilities) inputs.  

Changes
in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The
Company s derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology. A summary
of the weighted average (in aggregate) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring the Company s
derivative liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 is as follows:

Note
8 - Stock Based Compensation   

Compensation
expense for all stock-based awards is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an
expense, on a straight-line basis, over the employee s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity
award). The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Stock-based
compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate. The Company
estimates pre-vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflects the impact of estimated pre-vesting option forfeitures
in compensation expense recognized. For options and warrants issued to non-employees, the Company recognizes stock compensation
costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.  

Stock-based
compensation expense was $0 and $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense was $0 and $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

certain institutional investors (the  Purchasers ), pursuant to which the Purchaser subscribed for up to $375,000
of a 20% Original Issue Discount Junior Secured Convertible Notes (the  Junior Notes ). The aggregate principal amount
of the Junior Notes issued at the initial close is $125,000 and the Company received $100,000 after giving effect to the 20% original
issue discount. The lead investor was granted the option to require the Company to sell the Purchasers up to two additional Junior
Notes in the principal amount of $125,000 during each of the periods that begin with the Initial Closing Date and end (i) on or
before 45 days from the Initial Closing Date, and (ii) on or before 90 days from the Initial Closing Date.  

The

The
Junior Notes contains certain covenants, such as restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, payment of
restricted payments, redemptions, payment of cash dividends and the transfer of assets. The Junior Notes also contains certain
adjustment provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar
transactions. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, each Purchaser will not have the right to convert any portion of the
Junior Note if such Purchaser, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares
of the Company s Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to its conversion.  

In

the Company and the Subsidiaries granted a lien on all assets of the Company (the  Collateral ) excluding permitted
indebtedness, for the benefit of the Purchasers, to secure the Company s obligations under the Junior Notes. Upon an Event
of Default (as defined in the Junior Notes), the Purchaser may, among other things, collect or take possession of the Collateral,
proceed with the foreclosure of the security interest in the Collateral or sell, lease or dispose of the Collateral.  

As
a result of the Senior Note conversions, the Company became obligated to issue, subject to certain limitations, the following
additional securities: (i) 6,524,866,433 shares of Common Stock pursuant to  favored nations  provisions in certain
common stockholder subscription agreements which includes those anti-dilution shares of Common Stock previously disclosed; and
(ii) warrants to purchase 16,127,323,911 shares of Common Stock pursuant to  favored nations  provisions in certain
common stockholder subscription agreements which includes those anti-dilution warrants previously disclosed. These figures do
not reflect additional warrants to purchase Common Stock issuable to certain investors pursuant to the terms of the warrants issued
on December 16, 2016 which includes those anti-dilution warrants previously disclosed. The Company also lowered the conversion
price of the Company s outstanding Junior Notes and Senior Notes to $0.00042. The Company does not currently have sufficient
authorized and unreserved shares to fulfill its obligations with respect to the issuance of new shares of Common Stock. While
no assurances can be made, the Company intends to seek shareholder approval to adjust the Company s capitalization.  

As

Note
12 - North Carolina Facility   

On
July 20, 2016, DM suspended its North Carolina transaction verification services facility operations. The recent reduction in
the block reward from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins, often referred to as the halving, coupled with the facilities cooling system
failing, has resulted in DM being unable to meet certain of its financial commitments. The Company has subsequently ceased operations
at DM.  

On
August 8, 2016, DM discovered that its facility in North Carolina was broken into and certain of its equipment and approximately
165 Bitmain transaction verification servers leased from CSC were stolen. The value of the stolen equipment owned by the Company
does not appear to be material. The Company reported the theft to local authorities as well its insurance company regarding next
steps. The Company is currently working through the insurance company claims process for the benefit of CSC the Company s
equipment finance provider which owns the stolen serves. CSC would be the payee with respect to any insurance proceeds received
in connection with the stolen servers.  

On
September 1, 2016, DM gave cancelation notice to the landlord with respect to the lease of its North Carolina facility.

13 - Subsequent Events   

On
December 6, 2016, the Company issued a total of $220,002 Convertible Promissory Notes (the  December 2016 Notes )
to three accredited investors. The December 2016 Notes were issued in connection with a loan of $200,002 and the cancellation
of two $10,000 promissory notes previously issued by the Company to two of the investors. The December 2016 Notes are due on June
6, 2017 and bear interest at 8% per annum payable on the maturity date. In connection with the investments, the Company agreed
to use its best efforts (no later than 90 days from the original issuance date) to obtain shareholder approval to effectuate a
reverse stock split or increase its authorized capital (either, a  Charter Amendment ) in order to permit the exercise
and/or conversion of all of the Company s outstanding securities into common stock including securities owed to holders
pursuant to anti-dilution protection. Further, the December 2016 Notes required the Company to designate a series of preferred
stock with super voting power and issue it to an executive officer of the Company. In furtherance of that provision, the Company
issued 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Charles Allen, its Chief Executive Officer and a director, which provides Mr.
Allen with a majority of the Company s outstanding voting power. See Item 5.03 below. Until such time as the Company effects
a Charter Amendment, the December 2016 Notes are convertible into a preferred stock which shall be designated and issued by the
Company and a Certificate of Designation designating the related rights and preferences of the preferred stock shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of Nevada within 15 days of the investment. After the Charter Amendment is effected, the December
2016 Notes will be convertible into Common Stock. The conversion price of the December 2016 Notes is $0.002 per
share.  

The
Company may only use the proceeds of the December 2016 Notes for accrued and unpaid management compensation (subject to the $50,000
salary limitation as set forth in the April 20, 2015 Subscription Agreement Amended Agreement), unpaid out-of-pocket
expenses of employees, legal and accounting fees, and certain other fees and liabilities. The Company may not use any of the proceeds
towards payments to its outstanding note holders or investors that participated in the Company s past financings.  

Note
14 - Liquidated Damages    

Pursuant
to the terms of the Company s Senior Notes and Junior Notes the Company is required to issue shares of Common Stock to the
holders upon notice of conversion. The Company does have sufficient authorized shares of Common Stock to fulfill its obligations
with respect to its Senior Note and Junior Note holders and has booked a liquidated damages liability of $1,621,750 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

ITEM
2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

Certain
statements in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  are forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Words such as may, will, should, would, anticipates, expects, intends, plans,
believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof. We assume
no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the Risk Factors
contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February 19, 2016.  

Overview   

We
are an early entrant in the digital currency market and one of the first U.S. publicly traded companies to be involved with digital
currencies and blockchain technologies. Subject to additional financing, the Company plans to create a portfolio of digital assets
including bitcoin and other  protocol tokens  to provide investors a diversified pure-play exposure to the bitcoin
and blockchain industries. The Company intends to acquire digital assets through: open market purchases, participating in initial
digital asset offerings (often referred to as initial coin offerings). Additionally the Company may acquire digital assets by
resuming its transaction verification services business through outsourced data centers and earning rewards in digital assets
by securing their respective blockchains.  

Digital
asset blockchains are typically maintained by a network of participants which run servers which secure their blockchain. The market
is rapidly evolving and there can be no assurances that we will remain competitive with industry participants that have or may
have greater resources than us.  

Blockchain
Technology and Digital Assets Initiatives   

We
are also focused on digital assets and blockchain technologies. Subject to additional financing, we plan to continue to evaluate
other strategic opportunities in this rapidly evolving sector in an effort to enhance shareholder value.  

Transaction
Verification Service Business (digital asset mining e.g. bitcoin)   

We
believe that with additional funding we may be able to resume our transaction verification services business (digital asset mining
e.g. bitcoin) and believe this may provide revenue growth. If we are successful in resuming our transaction verification services
business we anticipate utilizing outsourced data centers and may diversify operations by securing other blockchains in addition
to bitcoins blockchain.  

Transaction
verification entails running ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) servers or other specialized servers which solve a
set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to a blockchain and thereby confirm digital asset
transactions. When we are successful in adding a block to the blockchain, we are awarded a fixed number of digital assets for
our effort.  

E-commerce
Marketplace (Discontinued)   

We
believe our e-commerce marketplace was the first such site to accept bitcoin. However, many new businesses (such as Dell, Microsoft,
Overstock, NewEgg and TigerDirect) opted to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. This posed serious competition for our marketplace
efforts and resulted in reduced consumer interest in our e-commerce marketplace. Although our ecommerce marketplace is still online
we have ceased all development efforts, are no longer marketing it, and do not currently support it.  

Financial
Results   

We
have a limited operating history. Therefore, there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation
of our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently
encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We have generated a net loss from operations of $0.2 million, and
$1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. We expect to incur additional net expenses
over the next several years as we continue to maintain and expand our operations. The amount of future losses and when, if ever,
we will achieve profitability are uncertain. The Company is currently working on restructuring its liabilities and raising additional
funds to pursue its business plan. The Company can provide no assurances or guarantees it will be successful in its efforts to
restructure its liabilities or raise additional funds.  

Going
Concern   

Because
of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, our independent auditors have indicated
in their report on our December 31, 2015 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern.  

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The
following table reflects our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
table reflects a relatively low operating loss for the 2016 period and significant cash expenses.   

Revenues    

Revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $16,000 and $169,000, respectively. Revenues represent
net revenue earned: 1) from the processing of customer transactions through our ecommerce website, 2) through fees earned from
our transaction verification service business, and 3) from hosting. The net decrease of approximately $153,000 or 91% is a result
of an approximately $153,000 decrease in fees earned from our transaction verification services business. Fees earned from
our transaction verification service business accounted for 99% of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
As a result of the Company suspending its operations at its North Carolina transaction verification services facility in July
we anticipated a substantial decline in our revenue for the third quarter 2016 and going forward.  

Power
and Mining Expenses    

Power
and mining expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $35,000 and $102,000, respectively.
The decrease in the power and mining expenses is the result of the reduction in mining activities and related electric costs for
our transaction verification services business.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $194,000 and $4.2 million, respectively.
The decrease in operating expenses over the prior year mostly relates to decreases in general and administrative expenses. General
and administrative expense was lower primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation of approximately $3.6 million.  

Other
Income     

Other
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $3.5 million and $282,000, respectively. The increase
in other income over the prior year primarily relates to increases in fair value adjustments for derivative liability shortfall
of shares of $7.1 million, fair value adjustments for convertible notes of ($2.9 million), fair value adjustments for warrant
liabilities of $1.0 million and is offset by liquidated damages of $1.4 million, all of which are non-cash expenses.  

Net
Income (Loss)    

Net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $3.2 million, net loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 was approximately $3.8 million, respectively. The increase in net income for the three months ended September
30, 2016 resulted primarily from fair value adjustments for derivative liability shortfall of shares of $7.1 million and fair
value adjustments for convertible notes of $2.9 million.  

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The
following table reflects our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
table reflects a relatively low operating loss for the 2016 period and significant cash expenses.   

Revenues    

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $356,000 and $351,000 respectively. Revenues represent
net revenue earned: 1) from the processing of customer transactions through our ecommerce website, 2) through fees earned from
our transaction verification service business, and 3) from hosting. The net increase of approximately $5,000 or 2% is a result
of an approximately $19,000 decrease in fees earned from our transaction verification service business, an approximately
$30,000 increase in hosting fees. Fees earned from our transaction verification service business accounted for 91% of our revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a result of the Company suspending its operations at its North Carolina transaction
verification services facility in July we anticipated a substantial decline in our revenue for the third quarter 2016 and going
forward.  

Power
and Mining Expenses    

Power
and mining expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $264,000 and $179,000, respectively.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $1.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively.
The decrease in operating expenses over the prior year mostly relates to decrease in stock based compensation of approximately
$6.4 million.  

Other
Expenses    

Other
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $25.8 million and $764,000, respectively. The
increase in other expenses over the prior year primarily relates to increases in fair value adjustments for derivative liability
shortfall of shares of $7.4 million, fair value adjustments for warrant liabilities of $8.1 million, fair value adjustments for
convertible notes of $3.2 million and loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million, all of which are non-cash expenses, and
an impairment loss related to investment of $2.3 million.  

Net
Loss    

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $27.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The
increase in net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from $7.4 million, fair value adjustments
for warrant liabilities of $8.1 million and fair value adjustments for convertible notes of $3.2 million and loss on extinguishment
of debt of $2.9 million, which are non-cash expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

At
September 30, 2016, we had current assets of approximately $9,000 and current liabilities of approximately $24.0 million,
rendering a deficit of working capital of approximately $24.0 million, which includes $20 million for the non-cash
fair value of derivative liabilities. On December 6, 2016, the Company issued a total of $220,002 Convertible Promissory Notes
(the  December 2016 Notes ) to three accredited investors. The December 2016 Notes were issued in connection with
a loan of $200,002 and the cancellation of two $10,000 promissory notes previously issued by the Company to two of the investors.
The December 2016 Notes are due on June 6, 2017 and bear interest at 8% per annum payable on the maturity date. The conversion
price of the December 2016 Notes is $0.002 per share.  

Our
working capital needs are influenced by our level of operations, and generally decrease with higher levels of revenue. We used
approximately $675,000 of cash in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We incurred approximately
a $26.9 million net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We had cash of approximately $0 at September 30,
2016. We expect to incur losses into the foreseeable future as it undertakes its efforts to execute its business plans.  

We
will require significant additional capital to sustain short-term operations and make the investments needed to execute our longer
term business plan. Our existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable
future. If we attempt to obtain additional debt or equity financing, it cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available
to us on favorable terms, if at all.  

Because
of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue
as a going concern. We have not made adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to reflect the potential
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Cash
Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Net
Cash from Operating Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately $675,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash
used in continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily driven by a $26.9 million net loss, offset
by $7.4 million of fair value adjustments for derivative liability shortfall of shares, $8.1 million of fair value adjustment
for warrant liabilities, $3.2 million in fair value adjustments of convertible notes, $2.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt
and $2.3 million of impairment loss related to our investment.  

Net
cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $515,000 and was primarily driven by the
loss incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $8.4 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation
expense of approximately $6.4 million and a $1.1 million loss on issuance of Units.

Principal
Accounting Estimates    

In
response to the SEC s financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting
Policies, the Company has selected its most subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology
used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects
on the Company s financial condition. These estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create a material
adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.  

There
were no material changes to our principal accounting estimates during the period covered by this report.

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   

This
report contains forward-looking statements including our liquidity. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such
as  anticipates,   intends,   plans,   seeks,   believes,   estimates, 
 expects  and similar references to future periods.  

Forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions.
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances
that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.
We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical
fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements include the market for microcap companies and our ability to effect a reverse
stock split and capital increase as publicly disclosed.  

Further
information on our risk factors is contained in our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statement
made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may
emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update
any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required
by law.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
assurance level due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:  

Due
    to our small number of employees and limited resources, we have limited segregation of duties, as a result of which there
    is insufficient independent review of duties performed.   

As
    a result of the limited number of accounting personnel, we rely on outside consultants for the preparation of our financial
    reports, including financial statements and management discussion and analysis, which could lead to overlooking items requiring
    disclosure.   

Difficulty
    applying complex accounting principles.   

Remediation
Plan   

When
we have sufficient capital resources we intend to hire additional accounting staff, and operations and administrative executives
and remediate each of the weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
