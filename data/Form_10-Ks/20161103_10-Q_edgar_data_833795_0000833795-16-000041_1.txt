HOMEFED CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

1.   Accounting Developments 
    
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, which reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items or items discussed herein) that management believes necessary to fairly state results of interim operations, should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) included in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for such year (the  2015 10-K ).  Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results of operations.  The consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   was extracted from the audited annual consolidated financial statements and does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for annual financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance that defines how companies report revenues from contracts with customers, and also requires enhanced disclosures.  The core principle of this new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  This guidance originally was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  In July 2015, the FASB confirmed a deferral of the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  We adopted this guidance early during 2015 when our long term debt was issued.  The adoption of this guidance had no effect on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In January 2016, we adopted the FASB's new guidance that amended the consolidation guidance including changes to both the variable and voting interest models used to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated.  This guidance also eliminates the deferral of certain consolidation standards for entities considered to be investment companies.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that affects the accounting and disclosure requirements for leases. The FASB requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the Statement of Financial Condition. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify and improve accounting for share-based payments. The amendments include income tax consequences, the accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments by introducing an approach based on expected losses. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods  
  
   6 

beginning after December 15, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain transactions are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance adds or clarifies guidance on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  There is   no   other comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
    
  Certain amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the 2016 presentation.  

2.   Acquisition 
    
  During 2014, we closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the real estate properties and operations of Leucadia National Corporation ( Leucadia ), their membership interests in Brooklyn Renaissance Holding Company LLC ( BRP Holding ) and Brooklyn Renaissance Hotel LLC ( BRP Hotel,  and collectively with BRP Holding,  Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza ), and cash in exchange for   7.5   million newly issued unregistered HomeFed common shares (the  Acquisition ).  The Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.  The aggregate purchase price of approximately $  215,700,000   (or approximately $  29   per our common share included in the consideration) was based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction and represented management s best estimates.  

3.   Investment Held to Maturity 
    
  In connection with the sales of real estate at The Market Common, Leucadia purchased bonds designated as  Tax Increment Bonds (Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Redevelopment Project Area, Junior Lien Series 2006B)  (the  Series 2006B Bonds ) issued by the City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (the  City ).  We acquired these bonds as part of the Acquisition.  Interest and principal on the Series 2006B Bonds are special obligations of the City payable only from specified tax increment to be deposited in a special revenue account pursuant to an ordinance enacted by the City Council.  The Series 2006B Bonds are junior to Series 2006A Bonds issued by the City.  Interest and principal on the Series 2006B Bonds is paid after there is sufficient tax increment to service the interest and principal due on the Series 2006A Bonds and to establish various reserves and deposits.  The tax increment that is pledged to service both bond series is generated from developed and to be developed residential and commercial property owned by us, and from   two   other large residential development projects adjacent to our project owned by third parties that are currently under development.  The Series 2006B Bonds bear interest at the rate of   7.5%   per annum, payable semi-annually.  The Series 2006B Bonds mature in October 2031.  However, the Series 2006A and 2006B Bonds became eligible for refinance on October 1, 2016, and the City refinanced them.  Upon redemption of the 2006B Bonds in October 2016, we received $  13,338,000   ($  10,050,000   of principal and $  3,288,000   of accrued interest). 

7 

The Series 2006B Bonds have been classified as held-to-maturity investments as we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  The principal amount outstanding and accrued interest aggregated   $13,338,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  The par value, amortized cost and estimated fair value of investments classified as held to maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (in thousands):  

In determining fair value, we utilize estimates of future cash flow projections with inputs based on our internal data and any available market information.  Inputs include estimates related to the assessed real estate values of the properties included in the tax district that services the Series 2006B Bonds, payments received and estimated tax increment generated from the estimated assessed property value.  A present value calculation is applied to the estimate of future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate, currently   10%   to reflect market risk and current market conditions when determining the estimated fair value of the asset.  However, for September 30, 2016, we determined the fair value based on the amount of proceeds received on October 1, 2016 from the redemption of the Series 2006B Bonds by the City. 

4.   Intangible Assets 
    
  A summary of intangible assets is as follows (in thousands): 

The amortization of above and below market lease contracts is recognized in Rental income.  Above market lease values are amortized over the remaining terms of the underlying leases, and below market lease values are amortized over the initial terms plus the terms of any below market renewal options of the underlying leases.  The lease in place intangible is reflected in Depreciation and amortization expenses and amortized over the life of the related lease.  
    
  Amortization expense on intangible assets was   $150,000   and   $150,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and was   $450,000   and   $550,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The estimated future amortization expense for the lease in place intangible asset for each of the next five years is as follows: remainder of 2016 -   $150,000  ; 2017 -   $500,000  ; 2018 -   $300,000  ; 2019 -   $100,000  ; 2020 -   $100,000   and thereafter -   $700,000  .

5.   Equity Method Investments 
    
  In April 2016, through a HomeFed subsidiary, we formed a limited liability company, HomeFed Village III Master, LLC ( Village III Master ), to own and develop an approximate   450   acre community planned for   948   homes in the Otay Ranch General Plan Area of Chula Vista, California.  We entered into an operating agreement with   three   builders as members of Village III Master.  We made an initial non-cash capital contribution of   $20,000,000   which represents the fair market value of the land we contributed to Village III Master after considering proceeds of   $30,000,000   we received from the builders at closing, which represents the value of their capital contributions.  The historical book value of the land we contributed to Village III Master is   $15,150,000  , which represents a basis difference of   $4,850,000  .  The basis difference will be amortized as future real estate sales occur.  Although Village III Master is considered a variable interest entity, we do not consolidate since we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary as all members share joint control through a management committee.    Two   of our executive officers are members of the   eight  -member management committee designated to consider major decisions for the Village III Master.  As a result of having significant influence, we account for it under the equity method of accounting.   Our share of the income earned from the sales of built homes by Village III Master will be recorded as income from equity method investments.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, we have funded   $22,189,000  .  Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our equity commitment.  We are responsible for the remaining cost of developing the community infrastructure for which we will receive credit as a capital contribution, with funding guaranteed by HomeFed under the Village III Master operating agreement.  The builders are responsible for the remaining construction and the marketing of the   948   homes with funding guaranteed by their respective parent entities. 
    
  The builders are obligated to contribute an additional   $20,000,000   to Village III Master on or after January 3, 2017 upon notice from us that the final map has been recorded subdividing the land into final development parcels and notice that certain other conditions of approval have been completed. 
    
  The Village III Master operating agreement provides that we are responsible for the remaining cost of developing the community infrastructure for which we will receive credit as a capital contribution, with funding guaranteed by HomeFed and the builders are responsible for the remaining construction and the marketing of the   948   homes, with funding guaranteed by their respective parent entities.   
    
  HomeFed is contractually obligated to obtain infrastructure improvement bonds on behalf of Village III Master.  See Note 14 for more information.   
    
  Summarized financial information for our interest in Village III Master (in thousands): 

We own a   61.25%   membership interest in BRP Holding.   Although we have a majority interest, we concluded that we do not have control but only have the ability to exercise significant influence on this investment.  As such, we account for BRP Holding under the equity method of accounting.  We also own a   25.8%   membership interest in BRP Hotel, which we account for BRP Hotel under the equity method of accounting. 
    
  We invested   $3,250,000   in BRP Hotel to provide funding for the renovation of the hotel during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The hotel renovation was completed during the third quarter of 2016, and   no   further funding is expected. Contributions were made on a pro rata basis, and thus, ownership percentages remained constant. 
  
   9 

Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee s underlying net income or loss is recorded as income (loss) from equity method investments.  The recognition of our share of the investees  results takes into account any special rights or priorities of investors; accordingly, we employ the hypothetical liquidation at book value model to calculate our share of the investees  profits or losses. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our equity method investments are comprised of the following (in thousands): 

Income (losses) from equity method investments includes the following for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

6.   Debt 
    
  Lines of Credit: 
  In April 2015, we entered into a   $15,000,000   revolving line of credit agreement.  Loans outstanding under this line of credit bear interest at monthly LIBOR plus   2.6%   and are secured by the Rampage property.  The draw period expires on January 1, 2021, and the loan matures on January 1, 2035.  There is also a   $3,000,000   operational line of credit available which is secured by the Rampage property s crops and matures on January 1, 2018.  As of October 31, 2016, no amounts have been drawn under either line of credit. 
    
  Senior Notes: 
  On June 30, 2015, we issued   $125,000,000   principal amount of   6.5%   Senior Notes due 2018 (the  Notes ) in a private placement. The Notes were issued at   99%   of principal amount and bear interest at a rate of 6.5%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year.  The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") and any of our future domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries, and mature on June 30, 2018.  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and the guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors.  
    
  The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our and certain of our subsidiaries  ability to incur, issue, assume or guarantee certain indebtedness subject to exceptions (including allowing us to borrow up to   $15,000,000   under our Rampage Vineyard revolving facility and another   $35,000,000   of indebtedness collateralized by our other assets), issue shares of disqualified or preferred stock, pay dividends on equity, buyback our common shares or consummate certain asset sales or affiliate transactions.  Additionally, certain customary events of default may result in an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes.  At   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with all debt covenants. 

10 

The Notes are currently redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount outstanding and any accrued and unpaid interest.  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture), we must make an offer to purchase all of the Notes at a price in cash equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  In addition, we are required to use the net proceeds of certain asset sales to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to   100%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the date fixed for the closing of such asset sale offer.  Accordingly, we have made or in the process of making the following repurchases: 

**   Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased will be determined based on the principal amount of the Notes repurchased and upon the closing date, which generally occurs on the third business day after the expiration of the asset sale offer.  
    
  Real estate held for development includes capitalized interest, including amortization of issuance costs and debt discount, of   $6,600,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Notes are presented on the Balance Sheet net of issuance costs of   $750,000   and   $750,000   and debt discount of   $700,000   and   $1,000,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

7.   Income Taxes 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that we had enough positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate enough future taxable income to fully utilize all of our Federal minimum tax credits.  The primary positive evidence considered was the formation of Village III Master with three national builders to develop and build homes at the Otay Land project and the projections of taxable income from the Otay Land and other of our projects.  In addition, our minimum tax credits have no expiration.  As a result, we were able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the entire portion of our net deferred tax asset; accordingly, approximately $  31,850,000   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was released as a credit to income tax expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During 2015, resulting from a tax matter related to the Acquisition, we recorded an unrecognized tax benefit of approximately   $2,950,000   which is reflected in Other liabilities and a corresponding reduction in our Deferred tax liability.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we increased the unrecognized tax benefit by approximately   $1,300,000   related to this tax matter.  Over the next twelve months, the Company believes that the unrecognized tax benefits will increase.  The statute of limitations with respect to the Company s federal income tax returns has expired for all years through 2012, and with respect to California state income tax returns through 2010.  We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year ended 2014. 

11 

8.   Earnings (loss) Per Common Share 
    
  Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts were calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.    The numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

If the effect of stock options were not antidilutive due to our loss, weighted average shares outstanding would have increased by   33,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

9.   Other Fair Value Information 
    
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our principal financial instruments that are not recognized on a recurring basis are as follows (in thousands): 

(a) The fair value of the long-term debt was determined by utilizing available market data inputs that are considered level 2 inputs.  Quoted prices are available but trading is infrequent.  We utilized the available market data based on the quoted market prices to determine an average fair market value over the last 10 business days of the reporting period. 
    
  For cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their fair values.  We did not invest in any derivatives or engage in any hedging activities. 

10.   Related Party Transactions 
    
  Joseph S. Steinberg, the chairman of our Board of Directors, and Ian M. Cumming, one of our directors, each entered into a Purchase Agreement with us and the Guarantors, pursuant to which they each purchased Notes 
  with a value of   $5 million  , or four percent (  4%  ), of the principal amount of the Notes issued (such purchases, the  Affiliate Note Purchases ).   Mr. Steinberg is also chairman of the Board of Directors of Leucadia. Each of Messrs. Steinberg and Cumming is considered to be a  Related Person  under our related person transactions policy (the  Policy ).  Accordingly, pursuant to and in accordance with the Policy and taking into account all  
  
   12 

relevant facts and circumstances, the independent Audit Committee of the Board (the  Audit Committee ) considered the Affiliate Note Purchases and approved, and recommended to the Board the approval of, the Affiliate Note Purchases, which were unanimously approved by the Board (with Messrs. Steinberg and Cumming abstaining from the vote). 
    
  Pursuant to a Placement Agency Agreement, Jefferies acted as Placement Agent for the Notes.  Jefferies is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jefferies Group LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Leucadia. Leucadia is our affiliate and a  Related Person  under the Policy.  Accordingly, pursuant to and in accordance with the Policy, the Audit Committee considered the Placement Agency Agreement and approved, and recommended to the Board the approval of, the Placement Agency Agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Board (with Brian Friedman, Chairman of the Executive Committee of Jefferies Group LLC and Joseph S. Steinberg, abstaining from the vote).  Pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement, Jefferies received a fee equal to   50 basis points   from the gross proceeds of the offering, received a fee equal to   50 basis points   of the outstanding balance of the Notes on the first anniversary of the Issue Date and will receive a fee equal to   50 basis points   of the outstanding balance on the second anniversary of the Issue Date provided that Notes are outstanding at such date.  Additionally, we and each of the Guarantors has agreed to indemnify Jefferies against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to reimburse Jefferies all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any action or claim for which indemnification has or is reasonably likely to be sought by Jefferies. 
    
  We entered into a consulting agreement between us and Patrick Bienvenue, one of our directors, to consult on various projects, primarily SweetBay.  The agreement was approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the Policy.  During the third quarter of 2016, we paid Patrick Bienvenue   $10,000   for his services and travel expenses under this agreement. 
    
  Village III Master: 
    
  Two   of our executive officers are members of the   eight  -member management committee designated to consider major decisions of Village III Master.  Each partner in Village III Master appointed   two   members to the management committee, which is controlled jointly among all members.  HomeFed is contractually obligated to obtain infrastructure improvement bonds on behalf of Village III Master.  See Note 14 for more information.  HomeFed may also be responsible for the funding of the real estate improvement costs for the infrastructure of the development if our subsidiary that invested in Village III Master fails to do so.         
  Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza: 
    
  As more fully discussed in our   2015   10-K, BRP Leasing is the indirect obligor under a lease for office space at BRP Holding.  Future minimum annual rental expense (exclusive of month-to-month leases, real estate taxes, maintenance and certain other charges) that BRP Leasing is obligated to pay to BRP Holding for office space is as follows at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

In the aggregate, substantially all of the office space has been sublet for amounts in excess of BRP Leasing s contractual commitment in the underlying lease. 
    
  Leucadia: 
    
  Pursuant to an administrative services agreement, Leucadia provides us certain administrative and accounting services, including providing the services of our Secretary.  Administrative services fee expenses were   $45,000   and   $135,000   for each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The  
  
   13 

administrative services agreement automatically renews for successive annual periods unless terminated in accordance with its terms.  We sublease office space to Leucadia under a sublease agreement until   October 2018  .  Amounts reflected in other income pursuant to this agreement were   $3,000   for each of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $9,000   for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Our Chairman, Joseph S. Steinberg, is a significant stockholder of Leucadia and Chairman of Leucadia s Board, and one of our Directors, Brian P. Friedman, is the President and a director of Leucadia. 
    
  Leucadia is contractually obligated to obtain infrastructure improvement bonds on behalf of the San Elijo Hills project. See Note 14 for more information.  

11.   Interest and Other Income 
    
  Interest and other income includes interest income of   $300,000   and   $300,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $850,000   and   $900,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  During the second quarter of 2016, our subsidiary at the SweetBay project received $  550,000   related to the settlement of a claim against British Petroleum ("BP") arising from the damages caused by the Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 and the resulting BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and recognized this amount as other income.   
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , interest and other income includes a   $1,000,000   recovery in January 2016 from the judgment against certain defendants in the Flat Rock litigation.  See Note 14 for more information on this legal matter. 

12.  Real Estate Sales Activity 
    
  Otay Land project: 
  In April 2016, through a HomeFed subsidiary, we formed Village III Master to own and develop an approximate   450   acre community planned for   948   homes in the Otay Ranch General Plan Area of Chula Vista, California.  We entered into an operating agreement with   three   builders who are members of Village III Master.  We made an initial non-cash contribution of   $20,000,000  , which represents the fair market value of the land contributed to Village III Master after considering proceeds of   $30,000,000   we received from the builders at closing, which represents the value of their capital contributions.  The   $30,000,000   in proceeds we received from the builders at closing was recognized as revenue from sales of real estate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The historical book value of the land we contributed to Village III Master is   $15,150,000  , which represents a difference in basis of   $4,850,000  .  The basis difference will be amortized as future real estate sales occur.  Our share of the income earned from the sales of built homes by Village III Master will be recorded as income from equity method investments.  See Note 5 for more information on this transaction.  
    
  San Elijo Hills project: 
  There were   no   sales at the San Elijo Hills project during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  During June 2015, we entered into an agreement with a local San Diego based luxury homebuilder to construct and sell on our behalf, for a fee, up to   58   homes at the San Elijo Hills project.  We received a   $500,000   deposit during the third quarter of 2015 which is reflected in Other liabilities.  This deposit is a builder performance deposit that will be fully refundable to the builder after the builder performs all of its requirements under the agreement.  As of October 31, 2016, we have entered into agreements to sell   four   single family homes at the San Elijo Hills project under this agreement for aggregate cash proceeds of $  5,550,000   which are expected to close during the first quarter of 2017. 

14 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a contract with a local developer to sell phase one and phase two of the Towncenter as well as a   two   acre site in the Towncenter previously designated as a church site for a purchase price of   $6,400,000  .  The purchase is contingent on the buyer obtaining plan approval from the City of San Marcos, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , phase one of the Towncenter is considered a held for sale asset.  The carrying amount of the phase one Towncenter asset, included in the Real estate held for investment line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and included in the real estate segment, is   $3,400,000   at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Ashville Park project: 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold the former visitor center for net cash proceeds of   $550,000   which generated a gross profit of   $250,000  .  There were   no   sales at the Ashville Park project during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Construction of the clubhouse and pool amenity at the Ashville Park project is substantially complete.  The timing of the development and sale of the remaining   195   entitled lots at the project is uncertain. 
    
  The Market Common: 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we closed on sales of real estate at The Market Common as follows: 

As of October 31, 2016, we have entered into an agreement to sell   20   single family lots for   $850,000   and   78   multi-family lots for   $1,250,000   at The Market Common to a homebuilder.  A non-refundable option deposit of   $25,000   was transferred from Leucadia to us as part of the Acquisition. 
    
  Maine projects: 
  In January 2016, we closed on the sale of a multi-family unit in Rockport, Maine and received cash proceeds of   $100,000  .   
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we closed on the sale of   three   lots at Rockport, Maine and one house at Northeast Point, Maine for aggregate cash proceeds of   $650,000  .  
    
  SweetBay project: 
  In April 2016, we received   $1,300,000   from the Florida Department of Transportation for the purchase of approximately   seven   acres of land at the SweetBay project to be used for the expansion of State Road 390.  
    
  The model complex and welcome center are now open. In April 2016, we began booking reservations for home tours with potential buyers, and   three   home closings were completed during the third quarter of 2016 for aggregate cash proceeds of $  900,000  . 
    
  During May 2015, we signed an agreement with a local builder to construct and sell on our behalf, for a fee, up to   127   homes at the SweetBay project.  As of October 31, 2016, we have entered into agreements to sell   33   single family homes at the SweetBay project under this agreement for aggregate cash proceeds of   $10,950,000   which are expected to close beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

15 

13. Real Estate Acquisitions 
    
  During August 2015, we agreed to purchase   67   acres of land for   $5,000,000   located adjacent to our Ashville Park project with the intention to entitle an additional   67   single family lots into the project.  We placed a   $200,000   refundable deposit and submitted the plans to the City of Virginia Beach.  The purchase is contingent upon approval of the   67   lot entitlement into our project by the City of Virginia Beach within 180 days from the effective date of the agreement for which the deadline has been extended to December 31, 2016.  If approved, the remaining purchase price will be due on the earlier of (i) the first lot closing of the additional   67   lots added to the entitlements or (ii) December 31, 2018. 
    
  We are pursuing fee title to the Pacho Property located in San Luis Obispo County, CA, which we acquired in the Acquisition and which is currently held for development as a leasehold interest with a book value of   $18,050,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  If we are unable to obtain fee title to the property in a reasonable period of time, we may not develop the property and an impairment of the asset may be taken.     

14.  Commitments 
    
  BRP Leasing is the indirect obligor under a lease for office space at BRP Holding.  See Note 10 for information concerning BRP Leasing s minimum annual rental expense.  
    
  In April 2016, the school at the SweetBay project refinanced its   $5,500,000   loan for which we had pledged   42   acres of land as collateral.  The school increased the total loan to   $8,100,000  .  Additionally, we dedicated the school site land and building to the school and terminated their below market lease.  We were also released from our   42   acres of land pledged as collateral.  We retained a repurchase right in the event the school defaults on their loan.  The loan is now only secured by the school cash flow and the real estate now owned by the school. 
    
  For real estate development projects, we are generally required to obtain infrastructure improvement bonds at the beginning of construction work and warranty bonds upon completion of such improvements.  These bonds are issued by surety companies to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project and provide funds primarily to a municipality in the event we are unable or unwilling to complete certain infrastructure improvements.  As we develop the planned area and the municipality accepts the improvements, the bonds are released.  Should the respective municipality or others draw on the bonds for any reason, certain of our subsidiaries would be obligated to pay.  
    
  Specifically for the San Elijo Hills project, Leucadia is contractually obligated to obtain these bonds on behalf of the project pursuant to the terms of agreements entered into when the project was acquired by us.  We are responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of outstanding bonds for each project is as follows: 

The Market Common is required to provide a letter of credit for the benefit of the City of Myrtle Beach to secure the completion of certain infrastructure improvements in the amount of   $1,250,000  .  Prior to closing of the Acquisition, we were required to replace the existing letter of credit.  We placed   $1,250,000   on deposit with a qualified financial institution to obtain the replacement letter of credit; such amount is reflected as restricted cash. 
    
  BRP Leasing is required to keep a minimum of   $500,000   on deposit in an escrow account to secure its lease obligations.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $1,400,000   was in the escrow account and is classified as restricted cash.  

16 

We agreed to indemnify Leucadia for certain lease obligations of BRP Leasing that were assumed from a former subsidiary of Leucadia that was sold to a third party prior to the Acquisition.  The former subsidiary of Leucadia remains the primary obligor under the lease obligations and Leucadia agreed to indemnify the third party buyer.  The primary lease expires in 2018 and the aggregate amount of lease obligations as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $23,750,000  , which includes approximately   $8,000,000   projected operating expenses and taxes related to the real estate.  Substantially all of the space under the primary lease has been sublet to various third-party tenants for the full length of the lease term in amounts in excess of the obligations under the primary lease. 
    
  As more fully discussed in the Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, upon receipt of required approvals, we commenced remediation activities on approximately   30   acres of undeveloped land owned by Flat Rock Land Company, LLC ( Flat Rock ), a subsidiary of Otay.  The remediation activities were completed in February 2013.  We received final approval of the remediation from the County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health in June 2013.  Otay and Flat Rock had commenced a lawsuit in California Superior Court seeking compensation from the parties who they believe are responsible for the contamination of the property.  In February 2015, the court denied us any recovery.  As a result, the defendants may be entitled to be reimbursed by us for their legal costs incurred, and we accrued   $350,000   during the first quarter of 2015 as we believed that such loss was probable and reasonably estimable.  In addition, the defendants are seeking to recover attorney s fees in the amount of approximately   $13,500,000   pursuant to an attorneys  fee provision in Otay Land s purchase agreement for the property.  In August 2015, the court denied the defendants  request for recovery of attorney fees.  The defendants have appealed the ruling.  Based on our evaluation of applicable law, we believe the claim for attorney s fees is without merit and we intend to defend against this claim vigorously.  We can give no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of this matter or that any appeal will be successful. 
    
  During the course of the Otay and Flat Rock litigation, we settled with one of the peripheral defendants which settlement included a cash payment of   $400,000   and an assignment of the settling defendant s then pending lawsuit in California Superior Court for the County of Orange against several other co-defendants for the costs of the settling defendant s defense fees and costs and indemnification for settlement monies paid in connection with the environmental cost recovery action.  Otay and Flat Rock proceeded to prosecute that assigned action and obtained a judgment against some of the defendants in an amount in excess of   $4,000,000  .  In January 2016, we collected   $1,000,000   of this judgment to settle the matter.  However, other defendants prevailed on a defense resulting in a defense judgment against Otay and Flat Rock subjecting them to payment of the prevailing defendants  litigation costs and attorneys  fees.   As a result, we paid   $200,000   during the third quarter of 2015. 

15. Stock Options 
    
  On July 14, 2016, options to purchase an aggregate of   7,000   shares of common stock were granted to the members of the Board of Directors under our 1999 Stock Incentive Plan at an exercise price of   $40.50   per share.    

16. Segment Information 
    
  We have   three   reportable segments real estate, farming and corporate.  Real estate operations consist of a variety of residential land development projects and commercial properties and other unimproved land, all in various stages of development.  The real estate segment also includes the equity method investments in BRP Holding and BRP Hotel, both of which were acquired during 2014 in the Acquisition and Village III Master, which was formed in April 2016.  Farming operations consist of the Rampage property which includes an operating grape vineyard and an almond orchard.  Corporate primarily consists of interest income and overhead expenses.  Corporate amounts are not allocated to the operating units.     
  
   17 

Certain information concerning our segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the following table.

Overview 
    
  HomeFed Corporation is a developer and owner of residential and mixed-use real estate projects in California, Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, Maine and New York.  After many years in the entitlement process, the majority of our assets are now either operating real estate or entitled land ready for sale.  We may also from time to time investigate and pursue the acquisition of new real estate projects, both residential and commercial.  

Transaction with Leucadia 
    
  During 2014, we closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the real estate properties and operations of Leucadia National Corporation ( Leucadia ), their membership interests in Brooklyn Renaissance Holding Company LLC ( BRP Holding ) and Brooklyn Renaissance Hotel LLC ( BRP Hotel,  and collectively with BRP Holding,  Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza ), and cash in exchange for 7.5 million newly issued unregistered HomeFed common shares (the  Acquisition ).  The Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.  The aggregate purchase price of approximately $215,700,000 (or approximately $29 per our common share included in the consideration) was based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction and represented management s best estimates.  

Results of Operations  
    
  We have three reportable segments real estate, farming and corporate.  Real estate operations consist of a variety of residential land development projects and commercial properties and other unimproved land, all in various stages of development.  Real estate also includes the equity method investments in BRP Holding and BRP Hotel, both of which were acquired during 2014 in the Acquisition and Village III Master (as defined below), which was formed in April 2016.  Farming operations consist of the Rampage property which includes an operating grape vineyard and an almond orchard.  Corporate primarily consists of interest income and overhead expenses.  Corporate amounts are not allocated to the operating units. 
    
  Certain information concerning our segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the following table.  

19 

Real Estate 
    
  Otay Land     Project: 
    
  As discussed in Notes 5 and 12, revenues include $30,000,000 for the land sold as part of the HomeFed Village III Master, LLC ("Village III Master") transaction during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Cost of sales was $22,800,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  There were no sales of real estate at the Otay Land project during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and during   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased by $50,000 for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   due to increased professional fees.   
    
  For the nine month 2016 period versus nine month 2015 period, legal expenses decreased by $550,000 primarily due to decreased legal fees relating to the Flat Rock litigation (see Note 14 for more information).  Professional fees increased by $50,000 for the nine month 2016 period versus the nine month 2015 period due to exploring potential deals with builders.  
    
  Interest and other income increased by $1,000,000 during the   nine   month   2016   period versus the   nine   month   2015   period due to the recovery of $1,000,000 in   2016   from the judgment against certain defendants in the Flat Rock litigation. 
    
  San Elijo Hills Project: 
    
  There were no real estate sales at the San Elijo Hills project during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  Since we are obligated to complete certain improvements to the lots sold, a portion of the revenue from sales of real estate is deferred, and is recognized as revenues upon the completion of the required improvements to the property, including costs related to common areas, under the percentage of completion method of accounting.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , revenues include amounts that were previously deferred of $75,000 and $45,000, respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , revenues include amounts that were previously deferred of $775,000 and $75,000, respectively.   
    
  We recorded co-op marketing and advertising fee revenue of approximately $130,000 and $110,000 for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $300,000 and $340,000 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We record these fees pursuant to contractual agreements, which is generally when builders sell homes, and the fees are based upon a fixed percentage of the homes  selling price.  
    
  Cost of sales of real estate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $35,000 and $20,000, respectively, and cost of sales of real estate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $360,000 and $45,000, respectively.  Cost of sales was recognized in the same proportion to the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting.   
    
  General and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016 decreased by $100,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower legal fees as a result of decreased sales and general business activity.  
    
  Ashville Park: 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold the former visitor center which generated revenues of $550,000 and cost of sales of $300,000.  There were no sales of residential lots at the Ashville Park project during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

20 

Since we are obligated to complete certain improvements to the lots sold, a portion of the revenue from sales of real estate is deferred, and is recognized as revenues upon the completion of the required improvements to the property, including costs related to common areas, under the percentage of completion method of accounting.  Revenues include previously deferred amounts of $100,000 and $400,000 for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $450,000 and $900,000 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  We recorded co-op marketing and advertising fee revenue of approximately $60,000 and $80,000 for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $200,000 and $220,000 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We record these fees pursuant to contractual agreements, which are generally recorded when builders sell the homes as the fees are based upon a fixed percentage of the homes  selling price.  
    
  Revenues from sales of real estate also include amounts recognized pursuant to revenue or profit sharing with a homebuilder of $35,000 and $145,000 for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  Cost of sales of real estate was not significant for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and was $250,000 for the three months ended September 30,   2015  .  Cost of sales of real estate was $450,000 and $550,000 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cost of sales was recognized in the same proportion to the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by $100,000, respectively, related to salaries expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   due to a reduction in headcount. 
    
  The Market Common: 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the rental activity is as follows:

21 

Maine projects: 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we closed on the sale of   three   lots at Rockport, Maine and one house at Northeast Point, Maine for aggregate cash proceeds of   $650,000  .  Cost of sales of real estate was $50,000 for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by $100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the reduction in management fees resulting from fewer remaining real estate assets to manage.   
    
  SweetBay project: 
    
  We sold three single family lots for $900,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of sales of real estate was $850,000 for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . There were no real estate sales at the project during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received and recognized   $1,300,000   as sales of real estate from the Florida Department of Transportation for the purchase of approximately   seven   acres of land at the SweetBay project to be used for the expansion of State Road 390. Cost of sales related to this transaction was $70,000.  This sale was a unique transaction in that we sold raw, unimproved land.  Future sales will most likely require us to develop and improve the land which will increase costs and reduce gross margins. 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by $50,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior year due to reduced legal activity for the project.   General and administrative expenses increased by $200,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in marketing activity related to the sales grand opening at the SweetBay project.  
    
  Pacho Project: 
    
  We are pursuing fee title to the Pacho Property located in San Luis Obispo County, CA, which we acquired in the Acquisition and which is currently held for development as a leasehold interest with a book value of $18,050,000 at   September 30, 2016  .  If we are unable to obtain fee title to the property in a reasonable period of time, we may not develop the property and an impairment of the asset may be taken.   General administration expenses increased by $50,000 and $100,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same 2015 periods related to legal fees.  
    
  Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza and Hotel: 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased by $100,000 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   due to a change in the timing of estimated capital tax payments for New York City and New York State. 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by $250,000 due to decreased capital tax expenses incurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   due to a reduction in the estimated annual projections for New York City and New York State assessments.

BRP Leasing: 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the rental activity is as follows: 

Farming 
    
  Rampage Property: 
    
  Farming revenues are generally recognized during the second half of the year when the crop is harvested and sold.  Farming revenues decreased by $550,000 during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 as a result of lower grape yields due to unfavorably hot weather conditions prior to the harvest. 
    
  Farming expenses decreased by $50,000 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a reduction in labor costs as a result of the lower grape yields.  Farming expenses increased by $100,000 during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to well repairs and additional farming expenses associated with developing the almond orchard.  
    
  Corporate 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased by $300,000 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits, professional fees and interest expense.  Compensation and benefits increased by $200,000 due to higher headcount added to oversee the newly acquired real assets.  Professional fees increased by $150,000 related to tax planning and accounting advice for   potential projects and joint ventures. Interest expense for 2016 includes $50,000 of accrued interest related to the uncertain tax position that was recorded in third quarter of 2015.  Legal fees, however, decreased by $100,000 due to lower general business activity. 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased by $350,000 during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in compensation and interest expense.  Compensation and benefits increased by $400,000 due to higher headcount added to oversee the newly acquired real assets.  Interest expense includes $100,000 of accrued interest related to the uncertain tax position that was recorded in third quarter of 2015.  Legal fees, however, decreased by $150,000 due to lower general business activity. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our provision for income taxes was $350,000 and $1,300,000, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 23.1% and 38.9%, respectively.  
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our benefit for income taxes was $30,150,000 and $1,950,000, respectively.  As discussed above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we were able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the entire portion of our net deferred tax asset.  As a result, $31,850,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was released as a credit to income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The effective tax rate was 42.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Net cash of $4,250,000 was provided by and $162,500,000 was used for operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, cash was provided by the sale of real estate at the Otay Land project in the amount of $30,000,000.  For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash was used for payments of federal and state income taxes and real estate expenditures on held for development properties including the improvement of the almond orchard.  For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, cash of $153,750,000 was also used for two acquisitions of real estate held for development at the Otay Land project.  
    
  Net cash of $10,250,000 was used for investing activities during the   nine   months 2016 period consisting of a $3,250,000 equity investment in BRP Hotel for the funding of the hotel renovation and a $7,000,000 equity investment in Village III Master in order to fund the project for the infrastructure improvements. Net cash of $35,900,000 was provided by investing activities during the   nine   months 2015 period principally due to liquidating the investments portfolio of $33,100,000 in order to partially fund the purchase of the Otay real estate in July 2015. 
    
  Net cash of $4,100,000 was used for financing activities during the   nine   months 2016 period related to the $3,300,000 distribution to a non-controlling interest related to the San Elijo Hills project, the repurchase of $1,250,000 of debt through asset sale offers and the payment of debt issuance costs of $600,000.  During the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, we received $1,000,000 from the exercise of options to purchase common shares.  Net cash of $119,850,000 was provided by financing activities during the   nine   months 2015 period related to the issuance of the $125,000,000 principal amount 6.5% Senior Notes for $123,750,000 (99% of principal amount).  Cash outflows for the nine months 2015 period include the distribution of $3,300,000 to a non-controlling interest related to the San Elijo Hills project and the payment of debt issuance costs of $1,150,000 during the nine months 2015 period.  
    
  Our principal sources of funds are cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of real estate, proceeds from sales of bulk grapes, rental income from leased properties, fee income from certain projects, dividends and tax sharing payments from subsidiaries, interest income, distributions from equity method investments, Rampage property s lines of credit and proceeds from the issuance of the Notes (as described below).  
    
  On June 30, 2015, we issued   $125,000,000   principal amount of   6.5%   Senior Notes due 2018 (the  Notes ) in a private placement. The Notes were issued at   99%   of principal amount and bear interest at a rate of 6.5%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year.  The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") and any of our future domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries, and mature on June 30, 2018.  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and the guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors.  
    
  The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our and certain of our subsidiaries  ability to incur, issue, assume or guarantee certain indebtedness subject to exceptions (including allowing us to borrow up to   $15,000,000   under our Rampage Vineyard revolving facility and another   $35,000,000   of indebtedness collateralized by our other assets), issue shares of disqualified or preferred stock, pay dividends on equity, buyback our common shares or consummate certain asset sales or affiliate transactions.  Additionally, certain customary events of default may result in an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes.   At   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with all debt covenants. 
    
  The Notes are currently redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount outstanding and any accrued and unpaid interest.  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture), we must make an offer to purchase all of the Notes at a price in cash equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 

24 

In addition, we are required to use the net proceeds of certain asset sales to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to   100%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the date fixed for the closing of such asset sale offer.  Accordingly, we have made or in the process of making the following repurchases: 

**     Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased will be determined based on the principal amount of the Notes repurchased and upon the closing date, which generally occurs on the third business day after the expiration of the asset sale offer.  
    
  We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, together with the other sources described above, will be sufficient for both our short and long term liquidity needs.  We also have the flexibility to refinance our long term debt if we choose to conserve cash for future business opportunities.  Residential sales at the Otay Land, San Elijo Hills, Ashville Park, The Market Common and the SweetBay projects are expected to be a source of funds to us in the future; however, except as otherwise disclosed, the amount and timing is uncertain.  We are not relying on receipt of funds from our other projects for the short and intermediate term, since the timing of development activity and sales of developable and undevelopable property cannot be predicted with any certainty.  Except as disclosed herein, we are not committed to acquire any new real estate projects, but we believe we have sufficient liquidity to take advantage of appropriate acquisition opportunities if they are presented.  
    
  Information about the Otay Land, San Elijo Hills and Ashville Park projects, The Market Common and our other projects is provided below.  Because of the nature of our real estate projects, we do not expect operating cash flows will be consistent from year to year. 
    
  Otay Land Project: 
  In April 2016, through a HomeFed subsidiary, we formed Village III Master to own and develop an approximate 450 acre community planned for 948 homes in the Otay Ranch General Plan Area of Chula Vista, California. We entered into an operating agreement with three builders, who are members of Village III Master.  We made an initial non-cash contribution of $20,000,000, which represents the fair market value of the land contributed to Village III Master after considering proceeds of $30,000,000 we received from the builders at closing, which represents the value of their capital contributions.  The $30,000,000 in proceeds we received from the builders at closing was recognized as revenue from sales of real estate during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016.  
  The builders are obligated to contribute an additional $20,000,000 to Village III Master on or after January 3, 2017 upon notice from us that the final map has been recorded subdividing the land into final development parcels and notice that certain other conditions of approval have been completed. 
  The Village III Master operating agreement provides that we are responsible for the remaining cost of developing the community infrastructure for which we will receive credit as a capital contribution, with funding guaranteed by HomeFed and the builders are responsible for the remaining construction and the marketing of the   948   homes, with funding guaranteed by their respective parent entities.  Our share of the income earned from the sales of built homes by Village III Master will be recorded as income from equity method investments. 
  HomeFed is contractually obligated to obtain infrastructure improvement bonds on behalf of Village III Master.  In 2016, we secured bonds of approximately $20,000,000.  See Note 14 for more information.   
  San Elijo Hills Project: 
  We have substantially completed development of all of our remaining residential single family lots at the San Elijo Hills project, many of which are  premium  lots which are expected to command premium prices if, and when, the  
  
   25 

market fully recovers.  We believe the market has made progress toward recovery and that our patience will continue to allow us to best maximize shareholder value with our remaining residential lot inventory. 
    
  During June 2015, we entered into an agreement with a local San Diego based luxury homebuilder to construct and sell on our behalf, for a fee, up to 58 homes at the San Elijo Hills project. 
    
  There were no sales of real estate at the San Elijo Hills project during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The number of units remaining to be sold is as follows: 

The Towncenter includes multi-family residential units and commercial space, which are being constructed in phases.  We have completed construction of the first phase of the Towncenter, which included 12 residential condominium units, all of which have been sold, and 11,000 square feet of commercial space, all of which has been 
  leased.      As of   September 30, 2016  , 37,800 square feet of entitled and undeveloped commercial space at the San Elijo Hills project remains to be sold or leased. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a  contract with a local developer to sell phase one and phase two of the Towncenter as well as a two acre site in the Towncenter previously designated as a church site for a purchase price of $6,400,000.  The purchase is contingent on the buyer obtaining plan approval from the City of San Marcos, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, dividends of $22,000,000 were declared and distributed by our subsidiary that owns the San Elijo Hills project, of which $3,300,000 was paid to the noncontrolling interests in the San Elijo Hills project, and the balance was transferred to the parent Company. The dividends retained by us did not increase the amount of consolidated liquidity reflected on our consolidated balance sheet; however, they did increase the liquidity of the parent Company.  
    
  Ashville Park Project: 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold the former visitor center for net cash proceeds of   $550,000   which generated a gross profit of   $250,000  .  
    
  During August 2015, we agreed to purchase 67 acres of land for $5,000,000 located adjacent to our Ashville Park project with the intention to entitle an additional 67 single family lots into the project.  We placed a $200,000 refundable deposit and submitted the plans to the City of Virginia Beach.  The purchase is contingent upon approval of the 67 lot entitlement into our project by the City of Virginia Beach within 180 days from the effective date of the agreement for which the deadline has been extended to December 31, 2016.  If approved, the remaining amount will be due on the earlier of (i) the first lot closing of the additional 67 lots added to the entitlements or (ii) December 31, 2018. 

26 

The Market Common: 
  Cash proceeds from sales of real estate and other real estate activities at The Market Common during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is comprised of the following: 

As of October 31, 2016, we have entered into an agreement to sell   20   single family lots for   $850,000   and   78   multi-family lots for   $1,250,000   at The Market Common to a homebuilder.  A non-refundable option deposit of   $25,000   was transferred from Leucadia to us as part of the Acquisition. 
    
  We have placed $1,250,000 on deposit with a qualified financial institution to obtain a letter of credit for the City of Myrtle Beach in connection with The Market Common; such amount is reflected as restricted cash at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  SweetBay project: 
  In April 2016, we received   $1,300,000   from the Florida Department of Transportation for the purchase of approximately   seven   acres of land at the SweetBay project to be used for the expansion of State Road 390.  
    
  The model complex and welcome center are now open. In April 2016, we began booking reservations for homes with potential buyers, and   three   home closings were completed during the third quarter of 2016 for aggregate cash proceeds of $  900,000  . 
    
  During May 2015, we signed an agreement with a local builder to construct and sell on our behalf, for a fee, up to   127   homes at the SweetBay project.  As of October 31, 2016, we have entered into agreements to sell   33   single family homes at the SweetBay project under this agreement for aggregate cash proceeds of   $10,950,000   which are expected to close beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Other projects: 
  In April 2015, we entered into a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit agreement.  Loans outstanding under this line of credit bear interest at monthly LIBOR plus 2.6% and are secured by the Rampage property. The draw period expires on January 1, 2021, and the loan matures on January 1, 2035.  There is also a $3,000,000 operational line of credit available that is secured by the Rampage property s crops and matures on January 1, 2018.  As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts have been drawn under either line of credit.  
    
  BRP Leasing is required to keep a minimum of $500,000 on deposit in an escrow account to secure its lease obligations.  At   September 30, 2016  , $1,400,000 was in the escrow account and is reflected as restricted cash. 
    
  Other liquidity information: 
  Option payments are non-refundable if we fulfill our obligations under the agreements, and will be applied to reduce the amount due from the purchasers at closing.  Although these agreements are binding on the purchasers, should we fulfill our obligations under the agreements within the specified timeframes and the purchasers decide not to close, our recourse will be primarily limited to retaining the option payments. 
    
  Since we are obligated to complete certain improvements to lots sold at the San Elijo Hills and Ashville Park projects and The Market Common, a portion of the revenue from sales of real estate is deferred, and is recognized as revenues  
  
   27 

upon the completion of the required improvements to the property, including costs related to common areas, under the percentage of completion method of accounting.  As of   September 30, 2016  , $1,050,000 of revenue has been deferred pending completion of the required improvements.  Estimates of future property available for sale, the timing of the sales, selling prices and future development costs are based upon current development plans for the projects and will change based on the strength of the real estate market or other factors that are not within our control. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents aggregating $56,550,000.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
     (a)        Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
  (b)        Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
  (c)        Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
  (d)        Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
     (a)         All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
  (b)        Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
