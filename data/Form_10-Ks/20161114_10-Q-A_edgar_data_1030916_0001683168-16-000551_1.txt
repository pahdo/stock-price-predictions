EXPLANATORY NOTE   

This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (this  Amendment
No. 1 ) amends the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Premier Holding Corporation (the  Company,   we ,
 our  and  us ) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as filed by the registrant on August
15, 2016 (the  Original Filing ). The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is as follows: 

(1)              
 To clarify certain potentially conflicting or confusing language regarding the Company s acquisition of all of the
membership units of American Illuminating Company, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company ( AIC ), from WWCD,
LLC, a company incorporated in the State of Illinois ( WWCD ). As previously disclosed, on May 6, 2016, we entered
into a definitive agreement with WWCD to acquire for $125,000 all membership units, including all licenses and contracts held,
of AIC, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensed supplier of deregulated energy. We previously disclosed that  after
final notifications and filings with regulatory agencies are complete, AIC is expected to begin supplying power immediately to
our customers, will recruit additional resellers of deregulated power and provide them with our sales tools to streamline sales
efforts, enforce compliance, and increase productivity.  That statement is correct, but we wish to clarify that consummation of
the acquisition of AIC is subject to FERC approval, which has not yet been granted. As a result, any descriptions of AIC as
our  subsidiary  or expectations of AIC s operations or coordinated efforts with our other subsidiaries are qualified
by our disclosure that consummation of the acquisition remains subject to FERC approval, and that AIC will have to obtain
additional state, local, utility and other approvals in order to supply power to the Company s clients in accordance with
our cross selling plans. We can give no assurances of when, or if, such approvals will be granted. 

(2)              
 To note the following change in the Company Financial Statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016: 

(i)               
 Balance Sheet - Prepayments related to the AIC acquisition in the amount of $125,000 were erroneously included as  Intangible
assets  and should have been recorded as  Deposit.  

(ii)             
 Statement of Cash Flows - Prepayments related to the AIC acquisition in the amount of $125,000 were erroneously referenced
as  Purchase of subsidiary   AIC, LLC  and should have been referenced as  Deposit.  

(iii)            
 Note 3 to the Financial Statements contains a reference that  [o]n May 5, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding
membership interests of AIC, a FERC-licensed supplier of deregulated energy, for $125,000. The total purchase price was allocated
to intangible assets for the value of the license. The initial accounting for the acquisition is not yet complete because the evaluations
necessary to assess the fair value of the assets acquired are still in process.  As referenced above, the acquisition
has not been consummated and the purchase price paid was allocated to prepayments pending FERC approval. 

The corrections referenced above are not
material to the Company or its financial results for the quarter.  

In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Part II, Item 6 of the Original Filing is hereby amended and restated in its entirety, with
the only changes being the addition of Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, and 32.1 filed herewith and related footnotes. 

Except as specifically set forth herein, this
Amendment No. 1 does not amend or otherwise update any other information in the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amendment No.
1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing and with the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission subsequent to the Original Filing.
