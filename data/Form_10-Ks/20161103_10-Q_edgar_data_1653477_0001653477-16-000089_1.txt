Note 1: Background 
  Ingevity Corporation ("Ingevity" or the "Company") is a leading global manufacturer of specialty chemicals and high performance carbon materials.  Ingevity participates in attractive, higher growth sectors of the global specialty chemicals industry.  Our specialty chemicals products serve as critical inputs used in a variety of high performance applications, primarily in three product families: pavement technologies, oilfield technologies and industrial specialties. We are also the leading global manufacturer of activated carbon used in gasoline vapor emission control systems in cars, trucks, motorcycles and boats, with over   750 million   units installed globally over the 30-year history of this business. We report in   two   business segments, Performance Materials and Performance Chemicals. 
  The Performance Materials segment primarily produces automotive carbon products used in gasoline vapor emission control systems in cars, trucks, motorcycles and boats.  The automotive carbon products capture and store gasoline vapor emissions that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as volatile organic compounds which contain hazardous air pollutants. The stored vapors are then largely purged from the carbon and directed to the engine where they are used as supplemental power for the vehicle. The segment also produces a number of other carbon products for food, water, beverage and chemical purification. The Performance Materials segment serves customers globally from its manufacturing operations in the United States and China. 
  The Performance Chemicals segment develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of specialty chemicals primarily derived from co-products of the kraft pulping process. Products include performance chemicals derived from pine chemicals used in asphalt paving, oilfield technologies and other diverse industrial specialty applications such as adhesives, agrochemical dispersants, publication inks, lubricants and petroleum. The Performance Chemicals segment serves customers globally from its manufacturing operations in the United States and Brazil. 
  Separation and Distribution 
  On May 15, 2016 (the "Distribution Date"), WestRock Company ( WestRock ) completed the previously announced separation of the business comprising WestRock's Specialty Chemicals reporting segment, and certain other assets and liabilities, into Ingevity, a separate and distinct public company (herein referred to as the "Separation"). The Separation was completed by way of a distribution of all of the then outstanding shares of common stock of Ingevity through a dividend in kind of Ingevity's common stock (par value   $0.01  ) to holders of record of WestRock common stock (par value   $0.01  )  as of the close of business of May 4, 2016 (the "Record Date"). 
  On the Distribution Date, each holder of WestRock's common stock received one share of Ingevity's common stock for every six shares of WestRock's common stock held on the Record Date. The Separation was completed pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with WestRock related to the Separation, including an Employee Matters Agreement ("EMA"), a Tax Matters Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and an Intellectual Property Agreement (collectively, the "Separation Agreements"), each of which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2016. The Separation Agreements govern the relationship among Ingevity and WestRock following the Separation and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. The Separation Agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by WestRock to Ingevity. For a discussion of each agreement, see the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Agreements with WestRock Related to the Spin-Off" in our Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 ("Information Statement") to our Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2016 ("Registration Statement").  The Separation Agreements were entered into on May 14, 2016. 
  The Registration Statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 25, 2016, and Ingevity's common stock began "regular-way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on May 16, 2016 under the symbol "NGVT". 
  Unless the context otherwise requires, references in these Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements to "we," "us," "our," "Ingevity" and the "Company" refer to Ingevity Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Separation.

Note 2: Basis of Presentation 
  The Company did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity for the full period covered by these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 consists of the consolidated balances of Ingevity as prepared on a stand-alone basis. Our combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and consolidated and combined statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively as well as our consolidated and combined statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, have been prepared on a  carve out  basis for the periods and dates prior to the spin-off on May 15, 2016.  
  Prior to the Separation, the Company's operations were included in WestRock's financial results and were comprised of certain WestRock wholly owned legal entities for which the Company was the sole business and components of legal entities in which the Company operated in conjunction with other WestRock businesses. For periods prior to May 15, 2016, the accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements were prepared from WestRock's historical accounting records and are presented on a stand-alone basis as if the business operations had been conducted independently from WestRock. Prior to May 15, 2016, WestRock's net investments in these operations is shown in lieu of Ingevity stockholder's equity in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities that are considered to comprise the Ingevity business.  
  For purposes of these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, the term  WestRock  herein refers to the legacy operations of MeadWestvaco Corporation ( MWV ) and its subsidiaries prior to the July 1, 2015 merger of MWV and Rock-Tenn Company ("Rock-Tenn") (the "Merger") and the combined operations of Rock-Tenn and MWV subsequent to the Merger. References to Ingevity s historical business and operations refer to the business and operations of the Specialty Chemicals Business of WestRock, or prior to the Merger, MWV, that were transferred to Ingevity in connection with the Separation. 
  These Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have not been audited. However, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been made. These Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) applied consistently with those used in the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , collectively referred to as the  Annual Combined Financial Statements  included in our Information Statement filed with our Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended. 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our Annual Combined Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The consolidated and combined results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Combined Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Combined Financial Statements. 
    
  Correction of an error 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we identified an error in our previously issued Combined Financial Statements related to the Performance Materials operating segment. The error was related to intercompany profit that was not properly eliminated from the inventory balances included within Inventory, net on the combined balance sheet. Management evaluated the materiality of the error from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that the error was not material to any prior periods. Further, we evaluated the materiality of the error on the results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 as well as on the expected results of operations for the full year and concluded that the error was quantitatively significant to the first quarter financial statements but was not anticipated to be material to the full fiscal year or the trend of financial results. Accordingly, we corrected the error in the period ended March 31, 2016. The impact of the adjustment to correct the error on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:

Note 3: New accounting guidance 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." The amendments in this new standard simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.   Under the new ASU, entities record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement, and entities classify excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, and we have early adopted this new standard during our second quarter of 2016. The impact of adoption did not have a material effect on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued its new lease accounting guidance in ASU 2016-02 "Leases."  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The amendment requires deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with related valuation allowances, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. As a result, each tax jurisdiction will now only have one net non-current deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that prohibits offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. This standard is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax asset in our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 "Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." The amendments in this new standard require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this standard. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line of Credit Arrangements." This ASU amends Subtopic 835-30 to include that the SEC staff would not object to the deferral and presentation debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These standards are applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We have adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016, and the impact of adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02  Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which amends certain provisions of ASC 810  Consolidation.  The amendment requires the consideration of additional criteria in (i) the analysis and determination of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities and (ii) primary beneficiary determinations. The ASU also eliminates certain fees from the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted these provisions on January 1, 2016. The impact of adoption did not have a material effect on the Company s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

  Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements

  (Unaudited) 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 which is codified in ASC 606  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  and supersedes both the revenue recognition requirement to ASC 605  Revenue Recognition  and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps set forth in ASC 606. An entity must also disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The ASU was scheduled to be effective for annual reporting periods, and for interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in July 2015 the FASB voted to amend ASU 2014-09 by approving a one-year deferral of the effective date. As a result, the Company expects to adopt these provisions on January 1, 2018, including interim periods subsequent to the adoption date, which can be applied using a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several amendments which clarify certain points in the new Topic 606-Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including ASU 2016-08 ("Principal versus Agent Considerations - Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net"), ASU 2016-10 ("Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing"), ASU 2016-11 ("Rescission of SEC  Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting"), and ASU 2016-12 ("Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients"). The Company anticipates adopting all of these standards at the same time. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these provisions. 
  All other issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. 
   
  Note 4: Fair value measurements 
  The following information is presented for assets and liabilities that are recorded in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets at fair value measured on a recurring basis. There were   no   assets recorded at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016, and there were   no   liabilities recorded at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015. There were   no   significant transfers of assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2 during the period reported. There were no non-recurring fair value measurements in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

     At   September 30, 2016  , the book value of capital lease obligations was   $80.0 million   and the fair value was   $97.1 million  . The fair value of the Company's capital lease obligations is based on the period-end quoted market prices for the obligations, using Level 1 inputs. The carrying amount of our long-term debt is   $433.5 million   as of September 30, 2016. The carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the outstanding debt based on the variable interest rate of the debt. At September 30, 2016, the book value of the Company's restricted investment was   $69.4 million  , and the fair value was   $70.3 million  , based on Level 1 inputs. The carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

  Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility 
  On March 7, 2016 we entered into a credit agreement governing a senior secured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), which provides for maximum borrowings of   $400 million   for the Company, with a    100 million   subfacility for our Belgian subsidiary subject to certain additional conditions on the initial funding date. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros and Japanese yen, with certain sub-limits. The Revolving Credit Facility has a letter of credit sub-limit of   $75 million   and a swingline facility sub-limit of   $40 million  . The Revolving Credit Facility can be utilized for working capital and other general corporate purposes as well as for funding associated with the Separation. The credit agreement also contains a senior secured term loan facility of   $300 million   (the  Term Loan Facility  and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the  Facilities ).  
  The Facilities mature on the five-year anniversary of the initial funding date. The Term Loan Facility amortizes at a rate equal to   0 percent   per annum during the first year after the funding date,   5 percent   per annum during the second and third years after the funding date and   10 percent   per annum during the fourth and fifth years after the funding date, with the balance due at maturity. The Term Loan Facility will require the proceeds of certain asset sales and casualty events to be applied to prepay the loans under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and reinvestment rights. 
  The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Facilities are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the borrowers  election, either (1) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a borrowing margin, or (2) an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin. The borrowing margin for the Facilities is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio, and is between   1.25%   and   2.00%   in the case of LIBOR loans and between   0.25%   and   1.00%   in the case of base rate loans. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility fees include (i) commitment fees, based on a percentage of the daily unused portions of the facility ranging from   0.15%   to   0.30%  , and (ii) customary letter of credit fees. 
  The Facilities include financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain on a consolidated basis a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of   3.75   to 1.00, which may be increased to   4.25   to 1.00 under certain circumstances,

and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of   3.00   to 1.00. The Facilities include customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments and change of control. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016. 
  On May 9, 2016, we borrowed   $300.0 million   under the Term Loan Facility and on May 13, 2016 we borrowed   $200.0 million   under the Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds of the combined borrowings, in addition to cash on hand, were used to fund a distribution to WestRock in the amount of   $448.5 million   and to fund a trust in the amount of   $68.9 million   both of which were in connection with the Separation.  
  As part of the Separation, WestRock required Ingevity to contribute   $68.9 million   in a trust managed by Bank of New York in order to secure repayment of the capital lease obligation at maturity.  The trust, presented as restricted investment on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet, purchased long term bonds that mature in 2025 and 2026. The principal received at maturity of the bonds along with interest income that is reinvested in the trust are expected to be equal to or more than the   $80.0 million   capital lease obligation that is due in 2027. The investments held by the trust are accounted for as held to maturity and therefore held at their amortized cost as the provisions of the trust provide us the ability, and it is our intent, to hold the investments to maturity. The fair value of the investments within the trust was   $70.3 million   as of September 30, 2016 (see Note 4 for more information). The investments held by the trust earn interest at the stated coupon rate of the invested bonds. Interest earned on the investments held by the trust is recognized as interest income and presented within Interest expense, net on our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.  
  Fees of   $3.6 million   were incurred and paid at the time of initial funding of the Facilities. These fees have been deferred and will be amortized over the term of the Facilities. These fees are presented as a reduction of the outstanding debt. 
  Debt maturing within one year consisted of the following: 

Long-term debt including capital lease obligations consisted of the following:

Note 10: Stock-based compensation 
  Prior to the Separation, stock-based compensation expense was allocated to Ingevity based on the portion of WestRock's incentive stock program in which Ingevity employees participated. Stock-based compensation expense recorded by Ingevity associated with WestRock's incentive stock program was   zero   and   $0.5 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $0.4 million   and   $1.8 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  Adopted at Separation, the Ingevity Corporation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan grants certain employees, independent contractors, or non-employee directors of the Company different forms of benefits, including stock options, restricted stock units ("RSU"s) and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSU"s). Our stock-based compensation expense recognized post Separation associated with Ingevity's incentive plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $2.2 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  Stock Options 
  All stock options vest in accordance with vesting conditions set by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors. Stock options granted to date have vesting periods of   three   years from the date of grant. The expense related to stock options granted in the period from the Separation through September 30, 2016 was based on the assumptions shown in the table below:

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of September 30, 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their in-the-money options at quarter end. The amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's stock. No options were exercised in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

As of September 30, 2016,   $1.6 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.4   years. 
  Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units 
  All RSUs and PSUs vest in accordance with vesting conditions set by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors. RSU's granted to date have vesting periods ranging from less than one year to three years from the date of grant. PSU's granted to date have vesting periods of three years from the date of grant, including grants that have a cumulative three year performance period, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance goals established for the respective grant. The Company periodically assesses the probability of achievement of the performance criteria and adjusts the amount of compensation expense accordingly. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period and adjusted for the probability of achievement of the performance criteria. 
  Nonvested awards of RSUs, both with and without performance features, as of September 30, 2016 are shown below. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was   $6.6 million   of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.7   years. 
   
  Note 11: Transactions with WestRock and related-parties 
  For periods prior to May 15, 2016, these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements include allocated expenses associated with centralized WestRock support functions including legal, accounting, tax, treasury, internal audit, information technology, human resources and other services.  The costs associated with these functions generally include all payroll and benefit costs as well as related overhead costs.  For periods prior to May 15, 2016, these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements also include allocated costs associated with WestRock s office facilities, corporate insurance coverage and medical, pension, post-retirement and other health plan costs attributed to the Company s employees participating in WestRock s sponsored plans.  Allocations are generally based on a number of utilization measures including employee count and proportionate effort.  In situations in which determinations based on utilization are impracticable, WestRock and the Company used other methods and criteria such as net sales which are believed to result in reasonable estimates of costs attributable to the Company.  All such amounts have been assumed to have been immediately settled by the Company to WestRock in the period in which the costs were recorded in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.  Such amounts are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows. 
  The Company and WestRock management believe the related-party allocations for periods prior to May 15, 2016 included in these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been made on a reasonable basis.  However, these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations that would have been obtained if the Company had operated as a separate entity during the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a stand-alone business would depend on a number of factors, including organizational structure and what functions were outsourced or performed by employees, as well as strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Consequently, Ingevity s future earnings as an independent business may include items of income and expense that are materially different from what is included in these Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. Accordingly, the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the Company s future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

    Ingevity Corporation 
  Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

The Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations prior to May 15, 2016, include allocations from WestRock as summarized below: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Allocated costs represent costs necessary to support the Company's operations which include governance and corporate functions such as information technology, accounting, human resources, accounts payable and other direct services including the interest on WestRock debt incurred to provide such services. 
       
  Prior to the Separation on May 15, 2016, the Company purchased certain raw materials from WestRock that were included in cost of sales. Total purchases prior to the Separation in 2016 were   $20.1 million  . Purchases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were   $5.6 million   and   $16.7 million  , respectively. Purchases prior to the Merger only included purchases from MWV. See Note 2 for more information regarding the Merger. 
  Subsequent to May 15, 2016, the Company was no longer a related-party of WestRock. Accordingly, beginning May 16, 2016, sales to WestRock businesses are reflected in net sales in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Purchases of products from WestRock businesses are reflected as inventory in our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet and prior to payment reflected as accounts payable in our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet. The Company's ongoing relationship with WestRock is governed by the Separation Agreements. As further described in Note 1, the Separation Agreements govern the relationship among Ingevity and WestRock following the Separation and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations and include arrangements for transition services to be provided by WestRock to Ingevity. In accordance with the Separation Agreements at the day of separation we recorded a payable to WestRock in the amount of   $16.5 million   primarily representing certain trade liabilities previously classified as related-party and included within Net parent investment in the Combined Balance Sheet. This amount has since been paid to WestRock. 
   
  Note 12: Pension and post-retirement benefits 
  Prior to the Separation, WestRock offered various long-term benefits to its employees, including Ingevity employees. In these cases, the participation of our employees in these plans is reflected in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as though the Company participated in a multi-employer plan with the other businesses of WestRock. For periods prior to the Separation, assets and liabilities of such plans were retained by WestRock. Net periodic benefit costs allocated to Ingevity associated with these pension plans, prior to the Separation, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3.2 million  . For the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015  , net periodic benefit costs were   $2.5 million   and   $7.2 million  , respectively. 
   In conjunction with the Separation, Ingevity employees stopped participating in WestRock pension and post-retirement benefit plans.  As further defined by the EMA, Ingevity assumed certain domestic and international pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations from WestRock on the date of Separation. The assumed retirement obligations consisted of accrued defined benefit obligations earned by Ingevity domestic hourly union employees as of the day of Separation net of contributed assets; accrued obligations from a frozen non-qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain salaried and former salaried employees of Ingevity; and other post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits. 
  On May 16, 2016, Ingevity established new qualified and non-qualified benefit plans, similar in design to the WestRock plans, to continue the pension and post-retirement benefits provided to our employees and retirees based on the obligations assumed from WestRock. Prior to May 16, 2016 Ingevity adopted the Ingevity Corporation Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) plan) effective January 1, 2016 as Ingevity employees ceased participating in the WestRock 401(k) plan on December 31, 2015. For our domestic salaried employees who will no longer participate in the WestRock pension plan, Ingevity provides an enhanced 401(k) contribution. The enhanced benefits consist of a transition contribution of four or ten percent of the employee s eligible compensation for  

17 

    Ingevity Corporation 
  Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016

employees who were grandfathered in the WestRock cash balance and final average pay pension respectively. The transition contributions will continue to December 31, 2020, unless the grandfathered employee terminates employment sooner.  
  The following table summarizes the assumptions used in valuing the obligations assumed from WestRock and components of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans as of the date of Separation.

    The discount rate used to calculate pension and other post-retirement obligations was based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the date of Separation. In selecting a discount rate, we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our third-party actuary which takes into consideration the projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments.

              (3) 
    Included in "Other Liabilities" on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet.  
       
  Our net periodic benefit costs for pension and other post-retirement pension plans recognized post separation in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. We did not make any voluntary cash contributions to our Union Hourly defined benefit pension plan in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 nor do we expect to make any voluntary cash contributions in 2016.  
   
  Note 13: Business separation 
  In connection with the Separation as further described in Note 1 and Note 2, the Company has incurred pre-tax separation costs as shown in the table below. These costs were primarily related to professional fees associated with separation activities within the finance, tax and legal functions. 

Note 14: Restructuring and other (income) charges, net 
  We continually perform strategic reviews and assess the return on the Company's operations which sometimes results in a plan to restructure the business. The cost and benefit of these strategic restructuring initiatives are recorded as restructuring and other (income) charges, net recorded within Other (income) expense, net on our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. These costs are excluded from our operating segment results.

We record an accrual for severance and other non-recurring costs under the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance. Additionally, in some restructuring plans write-downs of long-lived assets may occur. Two types of assets are impacted: assets to be disposed of by sale and assets to be abandoned. Assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or estimated net proceeds from the sale. Assets to be abandoned with no remaining future service potential are written down to amounts expected to be recovered. The useful life of assets to be abandoned that have a remaining future service potential are adjusted and depreciation is recorded over the adjusted useful life. Below provides detail of the restructuring and other (income) charges, net incurred.  
  2016 activities 
  As a result of continued deteriorating market conditions within the South America region, on October 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit our Performance Chemicals' manufacturing operations in Palmeira, Santa Catarina, Brazil.  As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge to property, plant and equipment in the amount of   $30.2 million   and recorded severance costs of   $2.0 million   to be paid beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Refinery production is expected to cease by year end with decommissioning of the facility to end by mid-2017. The Company expects additional exit and disposal costs incurred and paid through the first half of 2017 in the range of   $2 million   to   $3 million  . 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced the closure of the Performance Chemicals' derivatives operation in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As a result of this closure, the Company recorded   $0.5 million   of additional miscellaneous exit costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a   $0.1 million   impairment charge on fixed assets and   $1.8 million   in severance and other employee-related costs. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company also announced a company-wide restructuring to better align our workforce in light of changing macroeconomic and market realities. The restructuring decision resulted in workforce reductions at several of our locations. As a result, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded severance and other employee-related charges of   zero   and   $2.7 million  , respectively (  $1.9 million   related to Performance Chemicals segment and   $0.8 million   related to Performance Materials segment). The Company also recorded an impairment charge on fixed assets of   zero   and   $0.3 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively (related to the Performance Chemicals segment). 
  2015 activities 
  Income related to an additional gain on the 2014 sales of the Company's Performance Materials' air purification business in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
  Detail on the restructuring charges and asset disposal activities is provided below.

           (1) 
    Represents severance and employee benefit charges. Income represents adjustments to previously recorded severance and employee benefits. 
              (2) 
    Primarily represents accelerated depreciation and impairment charges on long-lived assets, which were or are to be abandoned. To the extent incurred the acceleration effect of re-estimating settlement dates and revised cost estimates associated with asset retirement obligations due to facility shutdowns are also included within the asset write-downs. 
              (3) 
    Primarily represents costs associated with rental payments, contract terminations, and other miscellaneous exit costs. Other Income primarily represents favorable developments on previously recorded exit costs as recoveries associated with restructuring activities.

  Note 15: Income Taxes 
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rates, including discrete items, were as follows: 

We determine our interim tax provision using an Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate methodology ( EAETR ). The EAETR is applied to the year-to-date ordinary income, exclusive of discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are then included to arrive at the total reported interim tax provision. 
  The determination of the EAETR is based upon a number of estimates, including the estimated annual pretax ordinary income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. As our projections of ordinary income change throughout the year, the EAETR will change period-to-period. The tax effects of discrete items are recognized in the tax provision in the period they occur. Depending on various factors, such as the item s significance in relation to total income and the rate of tax applicable in the jurisdiction to which it relates, discrete items in any quarter can materially impact the reported effective tax rate. As a global enterprise, our tax expense can be impacted by changes in tax rates or laws, the finalization of tax audits and reviews, as well as other factors. As such, there can be significant volatility in interim tax provisions.

           (1) 
    Relates to external customers only, all intersegment sales and related profit have been eliminated in consolidation. 
              (2) 
    Segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and other (income) expense, net). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: interest expense associated with corporate debt facilities, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other (income) charges and separation costs, and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.  
              (3) 
    See Note 13 for more information on separation costs. 
              (4) 
    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the charges related to Performance Materials:   zero   and   $0.8 million  , respectively and Performance Chemicals:   $32.7 million   and   $37.5 million  , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the income related to Performance Materials:   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
      
  Note 18: Earnings (loss) per share 
  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the Distribution Date. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was based on the number of shares of Ingevity common stock outstanding on the Distribution Date. On May 15, 2016, the Distribution Date, each holder of WestRock's common stock received one share of Ingevity's common stock for every six shares of WestRock's common stock held on the Record Date. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period beginning after the Distribution Date. The calculation of diluted net income per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. The same number of shares was used to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 since the   42,102   thousand shares that were distributed on the Distribution Date were not outstanding for those periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss attributable to Ingevity stockholders, as such all potential common shares were excluded from diluted earnings (loss) per share.

  Overview 
  Ingevity Corporation ("Ingevity" or the "Company") is a leading global manufacturer of specialty chemicals and high performance carbon materials. Ingevity participates in attractive, higher growth sectors of the global specialty chemicals industry. Our specialty chemicals products serve as critical inputs used in a variety of high performance applications, primarily in three product families: pavement technologies, oilfield technologies and industrial specialties. We are also the leading global manufacturer of activated carbon used in gasoline vapor emission control systems in cars, trucks, motorcycles and boats, with over 750 million units installed globally over the 30-year history of this business.  We report in two business segments, Performance Materials and Performance Chemicals. 
  The Performance Materials segment primarily produces automotive carbon products used in gasoline vapor emission control systems in cars, trucks, motorcycles and boats. The automotive carbon products capture and store gasoline vapor emissions that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as volatile organic compounds which contain hazardous air pollutants. The stored vapors are then largely purged from the carbon and directed to the engine where they are used as supplemental power for the vehicle. The segment also produces a number of other carbon products for food, water, beverage and chemical purification. The Performance Materials segment serves customers globally from its manufacturing operations in the United States and China. 
  The Performance Chemicals segment develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of specialty chemicals primarily derived from co-products of the kraft pulping process. Products include performance chemicals derived from pine chemicals used in asphalt paving, oilfield technologies and other diverse industrial specialty applications such as adhesives, agrochemical dispersants, publication inks, lubricants and petroleum. The Performance Chemicals segment serves customers globally from its manufacturing operations in the United States and Brazil. 
  Recent Developments 
  Separation and Distribution 
  On May 15, 2016 (the "Distribution Date"), WestRock Company ( WestRock ) completed the previously announced separation of the business comprising WestRock's Specialty Chemicals reporting segment, and certain other assets and liabilities, into Ingevity, a separate and distinct public company (herein referred to as the "Separation"). The Separation was completed by way of a distribution of all of the then outstanding shares of common stock of Ingevity through a dividend in kind of Ingevity's common stock (par value   $0.01  ) to holders of record of WestRock common stock (par value   $0.01  )  as of the close of business of May 4, 2016 (the "Record Date"). 
  On the Distribution Date, each holder of WestRock's common stock received one share of Ingevity's common stock for every six shares of WestRock's common stock held on the Record Date. The Separation was completed pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with WestRock related to the Separation, including an Employee Matters Agreement ("EMA"), a Tax Matters Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and an Intellectual Property Agreement (collectively, the "Separation Agreements"), each of which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2016. The Separation Agreements govern the relationship among Ingevity and WestRock following the Separation and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. The Separation Agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by WestRock to Ingevity. For a discussion of each agreement, see the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Agreements with WestRock Related to the Spin-Off" in our Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 ("Information Statement") to our Registration Statement  

25 

on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2016 ("Registration Statement").  The Separation Agreements were entered into on May 14, 2016. 
  The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 25, 2016, and Ingevity's common stock began "regular-way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on May 16, 2016 under the symbol "NGVT". 
  Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we," "us," "our," "Ingevity" and the "Company" refer to Ingevity Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Separation. 
    
  Results of Operations 
  For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
  The following table presents the consolidated and combined statements of operations of the Company: 

Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
  The table below shows the 2016 net sales and percentage variances from 2015: 

26 

Net sales 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Net sales were   $252.0 million   and   $256.5 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The sales decrease in 2016 was driven by a volume decline of $14.4 million (six percent of sales) across all Performance Chemicals' product lines as well as unfavorable pricing and product mix of $6.2 million (two percent of sales) in certain industrial specialties and oilfield technologies products within Performance Chemicals due to pricing pressure from competing materials. The sales decrease was partially offset by volume gains of $12.7 million (five percent of sales) in Performance Materials due to strong growth in high content vehicle production for sale into the North American automotive market and increased vehicle content due to regulatory adoption, favorable pricing and product mix of $2.0 million (one percent of sales) in Performance Chemicals' pavement technologies and Performance Materials, in addition to foreign exchange of $1.4 million. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Net sales were   $704.6 million   and   $757.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     The sales decrease in 2016 was driven by a volume decline of $70.3 million (nine percent of sales) across all Performance Chemicals' product lines as well as unfavorable pricing and product mix of $18.3 million (two percent of sales) in certain industrial specialties and oilfield technologies products within Performance Chemicals due to pricing pressure from competing materials.  The sales decrease was partially offset by volume gains of $25.4 million (three percent of sales) in Performance Materials due to strong growth in high content vehicle production for sale into the North American automotive market and increased vehicle content due to regulatory adoption. Favorable pricing and product mix of $10.0 million (one percent of sales) in Performance Chemicals' pavement technologies product line and Performance Materials also partially offset the decline in sales. 
  Cost of sales 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Cost of sales were   $171.0 million   (68% of sales) and   $178.9 million   (70% of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Reduced cost of sales was driven by sales volume declines resulting in a $2.4 million reduction to cost of sales, lower input costs related to petroleum-based raw materials, energy, freight, and CTO impacting cost of sale by $4.8 million as well as favorable manufacturing productivity of $1.0 million.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million primarily due to the strengthening of the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Cost of sales were   $487.5 million   (69% of sales) and   $526.1 million   (69% of sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales volume declines during the period contributed to a reduction in cost of sales of $30.7 million. The devaluation of the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar reduced cost of sales during the period by $2.6 million and lower input costs related to petroleum-based raw materials, energy, freight and CTO drove an additional $16.7 million decrease.  These decreases were partially offset by increased manufacturing-related spending of $11.4 million due to unfavorable productivity including costs related to the startup of our Performance Materials' activated carbon manufacturing facility in Zhuhai, China. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $29.7 million   (12% of sales) and   $28.0 million   (11% of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased due to higher employee-related costs partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that commenced in early 2016.  

27 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $86.2 million   (12% of sales) and   $88.3 million   (12% of sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to cost reduction initiatives partially offset by higher employee-related costs. 
  Separation costs 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Separation costs of   $2.5 million   and   $5.5 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were expenses related to the Separation. See Note 13 within the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements within this Form 10-Q for more information. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Separation costs of   $13.6 million   and   $11.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were expenses related to the Separation. See Note 13 within the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements within this Form 10-Q for more information. 
  Restructuring and other (income) charges, net 
  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  2016 activities 
  As a result of continued deteriorating market conditions within the South America region, on October 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit our Performance Chemicals' manufacturing operations in Palmeira, Santa Catarina, Brazil.  As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge to property, plant and equipment in the amount of   $30.2 million   and recorded severance costs of   $2.0 million   to be paid beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Refinery production is expected to cease by year end with decommissioning of the facility to end by mid-2017. The Company expects additional exit and disposal costs incurred and paid through the first half of 2017 in the range of   $2 million   to   $3 million  . 
  During the first quarter 2016, the Company announced the closure of the Performance Chemicals' derivatives operation in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As a result of this closure, the Company recorded   $0.5 million   of additional miscellaneous exit costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a   $0.1 million   impairment charge on fixed assets and   $1.8 million   in severance and other employee-related costs. 
  During the first quarter 2016, the Company also announced a company-wide restructuring to better align our workforce in light of changing macroeconomic and market realities. The restructuring decision resulted in workforce reductions at several of our locations. As a result, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded severance and other employee-related charges of   zero   and   $2.7 million  , respectively (  $1.9 million   related to Performance Chemicals segment and   $0.8 million   related to Performance Materials segment). The Company also recorded a   $0.3 million   impairment charge on fixed assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (related to the Performance Chemicals segment). 
  2015 activities 
  Income related to an additional gain on the 2014 sale of the Company's Performance Materials' air purification business in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively.

  Interest expense, net 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Interest expense, net was   $3.8 million   and   $5.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense consisted of $1.5 million and $1.6 million related to capital lease obligations and zero and $3.5 million in allocated interest expense from WestRock for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was interest expense of $2.8 million associated with our Facilities and interest income of $0.5 million associated with our restricted investment. See Note 8 within the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements within this Form 10-Q for more information on our Facilities and our restricted investment. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Interest expense, net was   $14.2 million   and   $13.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense primarily consisted of $4.6 million and $4.9 million related to capital lease obligations and $7.2 million and $8.5 million in allocated interest expense from WestRock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the allocated interest expense from WestRock in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to the Separation which occurred on May 15, 2016 because following the Separation, there was no longer any allocated interest expense from WestRock. Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was interest expense of $4.4 million associated with our Facilities and interest income of $0.7 million associated with our restricted investment.

  Ingevity has presented certain financial measures, defined below, which have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.  These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The below financial measures are utilized by management as some of the primary measures of profitability.  
  The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide management as well as investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business, because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Segment EBITDA are useful measures because they exclude the effects of financing and investment activities as well as non-operating activities. 
  Ingevity uses the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted EBITDA and Segment EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, separation costs and restructuring and other (income) charges.  Segment EBITDA is defined as segment profit plus depreciation and amortization.  
  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP and investors should consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.  Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Segment EBITDA to net income and segment profit, respectively, are set forth within this section.

Adjusted EBITDA 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Adjusted EBITDA     was   $59.6 million   and   $59.4 million   for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The factors that impacted adjusted EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected earnings discussed in the sections entitled "Results of Operations" and "Segment Operating Results" within MD A.   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Adjusted EBITDA was   $163.2 million   and   $170.4 million   for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The factors that impacted adjusted EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected earnings discussed in the sections entitled "Results of Operations" and "Segment Operating Results" within MD A.   

34 

Performance Materials 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Segment EBITDA   for the Performance Materials segment was   $32.3 million   and   $23.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The factors that impacted segment EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected segment operating profit discussed in the section entitled "Segment Operating Results" within the MD A, excluding the depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Segment EBITDA   for the Performance Materials segment was   $93.1 million   and   $72.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The factors that impacted segment EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected segment operating profit discussed in the section entitled "Segment Operating Results" within the MD A, excluding the depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Performance Chemicals 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Segment EBITDA   for the Performance Chemicals segment was   $27.3 million   and   $36.3 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The factors that impacted segment EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected segment operating profit discussed in the section entitled "Segment Operating Results" within the MD A, excluding the depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015 
  Segment EBITDA   for the Performance Chemicals segment was   $70.1 million   and   $97.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The factors that impacted segment EBITDA period to period are the same factors that affected segment operating profit discussed in the section entitled "Segment Operating Results" within the MD A, excluding the depreciation and amortization expense. 
    
  Total Company Outlook 
  For revenue, favorable volume and pricing in Performance Materials and in Performance Chemicals  pavement technologies applications are expected to be more than offset by negative pricing pressure and volume in Performance Chemicals  industrial specialties and oilfield technologies applications. 2016 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be flat to slightly higher compared to 2015. This is driven by expected incremental costs to be incurred as an independent public company, including costs to replace services previously provided by WestRock as well as other stand-alone costs. Offsetting these incremental public company costs are cost savings driven by a series of implemented cost reduction initiatives. The cost reduction initiatives include reductions in selling, general and administrative costs, supply chain spending reduction initiatives, and plant spending reductions. Additionally we will begin to see benefits from our major capital expansion projects that took place in 2014 and 2015. As these projects are reaching completion, we expect a reduction in capital spending versus each of the prior two years. 

35 

Fiscal Year 2016 Guidance 
  We expect to deliver fiscal year 2016 Net sales of $895 million to $905 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $192 million to $197 million. A reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA as projected for 2016 is not provided because we do not forecast Net Income as we cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of Net Income. These components include additional separation costs associated with the Separation and further restructuring and other income (charges) incurred in 2016 as well as the related tax impacts of these items. Additionally, discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. Further, in the future other items with similar characteristics to those currently included in Adjusted EBITDA, that have a similar impact on comparability of periods, and which are not known at this time, may exist and impact Net income (loss) attributable to Ingevity stockholders and Adjusted EBITDA. 

36 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Historically, the primary source of liquidity for Ingevity s business is the cash flow provided by operations which had historically been transferred to WestRock to support its overall cash management strategy. Prior to the Separation, transfers of cash to and from WestRock have been reflected in Net Parent Investment in the historical Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets, Statements of Cash Flows and Statements of Changes in Equity. Post Separation, transfers of cash to and from WestRock have been reflected in Transactions with WestRock in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows. We expect that cash from operations, together with borrowings available under our debt facilities, will be sufficient to cover our operating needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
  Cash and cash equivalents totaled   $27.1 million   at September 30, 2016. Management continuously monitors deposit concentrations and the credit quality of the financial institutions that hold the Company s cash and cash equivalents, as well as the credit quality of its insurance providers, customers and key suppliers. 
  Due to the global nature of the Company s operations, a portion of its cash is held outside the United States. The cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2016 included $17.4 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our foreign holdings of cash will not have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of our domestic operations. The Company does not currently expect to repatriate cash earnings from its foreign operations in order to fund U.S. operations. If these earnings were distributed, such amounts would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the statutory rate less the available foreign tax credits, if any, and potentially subject to withholding taxes in the various jurisdictions. 
  Separation and Distribution impact on liquidity 
  We do not expect the financing transaction we have entered (see Note 8 within the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements within the Form 10-Q for more information) in connection with the Separation, including the payment of the distribution to WestRock, to impact our cash flow requirements for 2016 or the foreseeable future. We expect to deleverage by using cash flow from operations to repay outstanding borrowings associated with the Separation. In addition, we expect our cash flow from operations combined with cash on hand to be sufficient to meet our working capital needs. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations and in meeting our interest and other contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2016 our available capacity under our revolving credit facility is   $255.8 million  . In addition, we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2016.  
  Cash flow comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Cash flows provided (used) by operating activities 
  During the first nine months of 2016, cash flow provided by operations increased primarily due to working capital reductions compared to 2015. Working capital reductions in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the first nine months of 2015 are primarily driven by increases in accrued expenses partially offset by increases in inventory balances. Below provides a description of the changes to working capital during 2016 (i.e. current assets and current liabilities). 

37 

Current Assets and Liabilities 

Current assets as of September 30, 2016 increased   $13.9 million   compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable, net as of September 30, 2016 increased   $11.8 million   consistent with the higher revenues in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Inventories, net increased by   $3.7 million  , driven by higher volume of raw materials, including CTO. 

Current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 increased by   $21.8 million   compared to December 31, 2015 primarily driven by increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable. Accrued expenses increased due to accrued payroll and employee benefits. 
  Cash flows provided (used) by investing activities 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily related to $69.1 million invested in a trust. In accordance with the Separation Agreements, we used a portion of the proceeds from our debt borrowing to be held in a restricted trust.  The trust, presented as restricted investment on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet, is to secure the principal payment under our   $80.0 million   capital lease obligation which is payable upon maturity in 2027. Refer to Note 8 in these Consolidated and Combined financial statements for more information. Outside of this investing activity, the cash used in investing activities each period is typically driven by capital expenditures.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, capital spending included base maintenance capital supporting ongoing operations and significant growth spending primarily related to the construction of an activated carbon manufacturing facility in China and new derivative equipment in Charleston, South Carolina supporting the adhesives, pavement and oilfield markets. 

Projected 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $60 million to $65 million. 

38 

Cash flows provided (used) by financing activities 
  As WestRock managed the Company s cash and financing arrangements before the Separation, all excess cash generated through earnings was remitted to WestRock and all sources of cash were funded by WestRock prior to May 15, 2016. 
  Cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $28.0 million   and was driven by net borrowings of $428.7 million (refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated and Combined financial statements for more information) and an inflow from transactions with WestRock of   $51.4 million   offset by a distribution to WestRock at Separation of $448.5 million. Cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   $36.2 million   and was driven by net short term borrowings of $8.3 million and an inflow from transactions with WestRock of   $30.6 million  . 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Information related to our contractual commitments at December 31, 2015 can be found in a table on page 63 included within Information Statement filed with our Registration Statement. The only significant change to our contractual commitments since the filing of our Registration Statement is the borrowings under our Facilities. For information regarding borrowings made under our Facilities, see Note 8 within the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements within this Form 10-Q. Our obligations under the Facilities and short-term debt are summarized below. 

New Accounting Guidance 
  Refer to the Note 3 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included within this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 2 to our Annual Combined Financial Statements included in our Information Statement filed with our Registration Statement. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.  
  The following is a list of those accounting policies that we have deemed most critical to the presentation and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. See the  Critical Accounting Policies  section included within the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Ingevity" section in our Information Statement filed with our Registration Statement for a detailed description of these policies and their potential effects on our results of operations and financial condition.

  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
  The Company has foreign-based operations, primarily in Europe, South America and Asia, which accounted for approximately 24 percent of its net sales in the first nine months of 2016. The Company s significant operations outside the United States have designated the local currency as their functional currency. The primary currencies for which the Company has exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan. In addition, certain of the Company s domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the Company also makes inter-company sales. All of this exposes the Company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our earnings are therefore subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when the earnings in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. We do not hedge this translation impact on earnings. The U.S. dollar versus the euro is the Company s most significant foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent change in the average euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, would have changed the Company s net sales and income before income taxes by approximately $6 million or one percent and $4 million or four percent, respectively. 
  Concentration of credit risk 
  The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable. The Company limits its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, when necessary, requiring letters of credit, guarantees or collateral. The Company had accounts receivable relating to its largest customer of $17 million and $15 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Commodity price risk 
  A portion of our manufacturing costs include purchased raw materials, which are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with the changes in these commodity prices. The cost of energy is a manufacturing cost that is exposed to commodity pricing. The Company s energy costs are diversified among electricity, steam and natural gas, with natural gas comprising our largest energy input. 
  Crude tall oil price risk 
  Our results of operations are directly affected by the cost of our raw materials, particularly CTO. Pricing for CTO (which accounts for approximately 13 percent of all of our cost of sales and 39 percent of our raw materials purchases for the first nine months of 2016) is subject to particular pricing pressures by reasons of the limited supply elasticity of the product and competing demands for its use, all of which drive pressure on price. Our gross profit and margins could be adversely affected by changes in the cost of CTO if we are unable to pass the increases on to our customers. CTO is a thinly traded commodity with pricing commonly established for periods ranging from one quarter to one year periods of time. The Company tries to protect against such pricing fluctuations through various business strategies. Based on average pricing during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a hypothetical unfavorable 10 percent change in the market price for CTO would have resulted in additional costs of sales of approximately $6 million or one percent, which we may or may not have been able to pass on to our customers. 
  Natural gas price risk 
  Natural gas is our largest form of energy purchases constituting approximately two percent of our cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increases in natural gas costs, unless passed on to our customers, would adversely affect our results of operations. If natural gas prices increase significantly, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 a hypothetical unfavorable 10 percent change in natural gas pricing would have resulted in an additional cost of sales of approximately $0.8 million. 
  Historically, prior to the Merger, the Company entered into natural gas hedges in order to better predict and control the future cost of natural gas consumed at the Company s plants. There are no natural gas derivatives contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016. 

40 

Interest Rate Risk 
  As of September 30, 2016, approximately $440.5 million of our borrowings include a variable interest rate component. As a result, we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to such floating-rate debt. A 100 basis point increase in the variable interest rate component of our borrowings would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $4 million or 27 percent. 
   
  ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These controls and procedures also give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), together with management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level described above.  
    
  b)    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
