ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere
in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and
beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements.  Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in
this Annual Report.  Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going
concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  

We
expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital
through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

Our
net loss for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was $45,719 compared to $30,152 during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015.
During fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we did not generate any revenue. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, we had
$2,500 in revenues.  

During
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we incurred expenses of $45,719, as compared to $32,652 during the fiscal year ended August
31, 2015.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

As
of August 31, 2016, our only asset was a prepaid expense in the amount of $833. Our total assets were $18,902 at August 31, 2015,
including $17,364 in cash, $150 in prepaid expenses and $1,388 in fixed assets. As of August 31, 2016, our current liabilities
were $28,287, as compared to $15,066 at August 31, 2015.  

Stockholders 
equity decreased from $3,836 as of August 31, 2015 to a deficit of $(27,454) as of August 31, 2016.  

The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 11,600,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, as compared to
10,198,548 shares for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities    

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used
in operating activities was $46,097. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $29,840 for the fiscal year ended August
31, 2015.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities    

For
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, there were no net cash flows used in investing activities.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities    

We
have financed our operations from either loans or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the fiscal year ended August
31, 2016, net cash flows from financing activities was $28,733, including a $2,054 repayment of loan to a former director and
proceeds of $30,787 from loans received from major shareholders. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, net cash flows from
financing activities was $40,000 from issuance of common stock and loans from director.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of related party loans and issuances
of equity and debt securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase if and when we are able to execute on
our current business plan. As of August 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit in the amount of $27,454.  

We
expect to fund our operations over the next 12 months with further loans from related parties. We have no lines of credit or other
bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity
and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses
and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses.
We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need
to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or
convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences
or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business
endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  

MATERIAL
COMMITMENTS  

As
of the date of this annual report, we do not have any material commitments.  

PURCHASE
OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT  

We
do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.  

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

As
of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have
a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

GOING
CONCERN  

The
independent auditors' report accompanying our August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 audited financial statements contains an explanatory
paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements have been
prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and
satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To the Board of Directors 

 Luboa Group, Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Luboa
Group, Inc. as of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders  deficit and
cash flows for the years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Luboa Group, Inc. as of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015
and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements,
although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   

Organization
and Description of Business   

Luboa
Group, Inc. (the  Company ), formerly known as Sunrise Tours, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada on March 19, 2013 ( Inception ) and has adopted August 31 fiscal year end.  On January 20, 2016, the Company
filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada and changed its corporate name to  Luboa Group, Inc. 
Concurrently with the change of corporate name, the Company also changed its principal business plan from developing and offering
special services such as 3D virtual tours for companies which would like to promote their venues on the Internet and electronic
media, to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in Asia. However, as of August 31,
2016, no definitive agreement had been entered into in connection with the business plan. The Company s principal headquarters
is located in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan .  From Inception through August 31, 2016 the Company had accumulated losses
of $76,883.  

In
June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2014-10,  Development Stage Entities . The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage
entity from the Master Glossary of the ASC thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities
and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities
to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the
entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior
years it had been in the development stage. The amendments in this update are applied retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2014-10
removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements for the Company.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company has incurred a loss since Inception, resulting in accumulated deficit of $76,883 as of August 31, 2016, and further losses
are anticipated in the development of its business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern.    

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to successfully execute its business plan
and generate profitable operations in the future, and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the
next twelve months with loans from related parties and the issuance of equity and debt securities.    

NOTE
3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and are presented in US dollars.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

  For
purposes of the accompanying statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The
funds are insured up to $250,000. At August 31, 2016, the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.  

Basic
and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share   

  The
Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share,  which requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive
loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

For
the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding
and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the Company incurred
losses in these years.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

  ASC
820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used
in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  

These
tiers include:  

Level
1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

  Level
2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  

  Level
3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

The
carrying value of cash and the Company s loan from shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.  

Income
Taxes   

  The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Under ASC 740, deferred income taxes are provided
on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards
and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred
tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.  

ASC
740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC
740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more
likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At August 31, 2016, there were no unrecognized tax
benefits.  

Revenue
Recognition   

  The
Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . ASC-605 requires that four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
(4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability
of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not
been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has
been delivered or no refund will be required.  

Advertising
Costs   

  The
Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense
of $0 during years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

  Management
has reviewed all of the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe any of these pronouncements
will have a material impact on the Company.  

Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

  As
of August 31, 2016, the Company had not issued any stock-based compensation to its employees.  

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable.  To date, the Company has not adopted
a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.  

NOTE
4   COMMON STOCK   

The
Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.  

On
September 23, 2013, the Company issued 9,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $9,000.  

During
the year ended August 31, 2015, the Company issued 2,600,000 shares at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $26,000.  

As
at August 31, 2016, 11,600,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. See Note 8 (Change of Control) regarding the
January 14, 2016 transaction resulting in the ownership change of approximately 77.59% of these common shares.  

NOTE
5   INCOME TAXES   

As
of August 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $76,791 that may be available to reduce
future years  taxable income through 2035 and 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have
not been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur
and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.  

Components
of net deferred tax assets, including a valuation allowance, are as follows at August 31, 2016 and 2015:  

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2016 was $26,877. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected
future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely
than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Reconciliation
between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows at August 31, 2016 and 2015:  

NOTE
6   LOAN FROM SHAREHOLDER   

The
Company relies on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate
financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support
by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary
in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.    

From
Inception through January 14, 2016, the Company s then sole shareholder and director Alexander Karpetskiy loaned the Company
$15,066 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  The loan was non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.
As of January 14, 2016, the amount outstanding was $14,429. As a result of the ownership change described in Note 8, the entire
unpaid balance of the loan was discharged by Mr. Karpetskiy.  

Since
January 14, 2016, a current director who is also one of the Company s major shareholders has loaned the Company $28,187
to pay for operating expenses.  As of August 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $28,187. The loan is non-interest bearing,
due upon demand and unsecured.  

NOTE
7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

In
accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to August 31, 2016 to the date these financial
statements were issued on November 28, 2016, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose
in these financial statements.  

NOTE
8   CHANGE OF CONTROL   

On
January 14, 2016 (the  Closing Date ), Mr. Karpetskiy entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA )
with Hsin-Nan Lin, pursuant to which Mr. Lin acquired from Mr. Karpetskiy all 9 million shares of the Company s common stock
owned by him. Pursuant to the SPA, all of the Company s outstanding liabilities as of the Closing Date, including the outstanding
balance of Mr. Karpetskiy s loan to the Company, were fully paid by utilizing cash on hand (or discharged in the case of
Mr. Karpetskiy s loan). As a result, the Company was relieved of unpaid shareholder loan in the amount of $14,428, which
is recorded by the Company as additional paid-in capital as of August 31, 2016.  

NOTE
9   RESTATEMENT    

The
financial statements have been revised to correct the accounting treatment of activities related to certain prepaid deposit at
a personal trust account made by one of the Company s current director and major shareholders. The prepaid deposit was accounted
for as part of the Company s prepaid expenses in the unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended February 29,
2016 and May 31, 2016. The revision also removed certain expenses incurred by the major shareholder in connection with the change
of control transaction described in Note 8 above from the statements of operations for the quarters ended February 29, 2016 and
May 31, 2016. The revision adjusted the account balances of the Company s prepaid expenses loan from shareholder, accounts
payable, general and administrative expenses, and deficit accumulated during the development stage for the periods affected. In
accordance with applicable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company calculated and recognized adjustments
accordingly.  

The
following tables represent the effects of the restated statements as of February 29 and May 31, 2016.

12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS   

  The
following table sets forth information as of August 31, 2016 regarding the ownership of our common stock by each shareholder known
by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our outstanding shares of common stock, each executive officer and
director, and all executive officers and directors as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, each of the shareholders has sole
voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock beneficially owned.   

(1)    Unless
                                         otherwise noted, the address for each of the named beneficial owners is: 3F., No. 102,
                                         Bo ai 2nd Road, Zuoying District, Kaohsiung City 813, Taiwan.    

(2)    Under
                                         Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly,
                                         through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares:
                                         (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares;
                                         and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition
                                         of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person
                                         (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
                                         In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has
                                         the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days
                                         of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
                                         of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares
                                         beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition
                                         rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this
                                         table does not necessarily reflect the person's actual ownership or voting power with
                                         respect to the number of shares actually outstanding.
