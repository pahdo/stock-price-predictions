Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

(1)     Basis of Presentation     

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of UFP Technologies, Inc.
(the  Company ) presented herein, have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all the information and note disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K,
as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the condensed
consolidated statements of income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited but, in the opinion of management,
include all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim
periods. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s annual financial
statements that were audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, but does not include all of the information and
footnotes required for complete annual financial statements. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

The results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting . This ASU simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards and
classification on the statement of cash flows. The provisions of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This amendment is applicable to the Company
beginning in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial
position and results of operations. 

(2)     Supplemental Cash Flow Information     

Cash paid (received) for interest and income taxes is as follows (in thousands): 

(3)     Fair Value of Financial Instruments     

The Company has financial instruments, such
as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, which are stated at carrying amounts that approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair
value as the interest rate on the debt approximates the estimated borrowing rate currently available to the Company . 

(4)     Share-Based Compensation     

Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value
of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). 

The Company issues share-based awards through several plans that are described
in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The compensation cost charged
against income for those plans is included in selling, general   administrative expenses as follows (in thousands): 

Share-based compensation for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 includes approximately $105,000, in each period respectively, representing the fair value of the Company s common
stock granted during the periods to the Company s Board of Directors. 

The total income tax benefit recognized in the condensed consolidated statements
of income for share-based compensation arrangements was approximately $67,000 and $63,000, for the three-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $264,000 and $256,000, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The following is a summary of stock option activity under all plans for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016: 

On June 9, 2016, the Company granted options to its directors for the purchase
of 17,184 shares of common stock at that day s closing price of $22.02. The compensation expense related to these grants
was determined as the fair value of the options using the Black Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: 

The stock volatility for each grant is determined based on a review of the experience
of the weighted average of historical daily price changes of the Company s common stock over the expected option term, and
the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding
with the expected term of the option. The expected term is calculated based on the simplified method. 

During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total intrinsic
value of all options exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price on the exercise date and the price paid by the employees
to exercise the options) was approximately $564,000 and $989,000, respectively, and the total amount of consideration received
by the Company from the exercised options was approximately $529,000 and $258,000, respectively. At its discretion, the Company
allows option holders to surrender previously owned common stock in lieu of paying the exercise price and withholding taxes. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no shares surrendered for this purpose. During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, there were 1,632 shares surrendered at an average market price of $21.97. 

During each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recognized compensation expense related to stock options granted to directors and employees of approximately $34,000 and
$44,000, respectively. During each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized compensation
expense related to stock options granted to directors and employees of approximately $212,000 and $237,000, respectively. 

On February 22, 2016, the Company s Compensation Committee approved the
award of $400,000, payable in shares of common stock to the Company s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President under
the 2003 Incentive Plan. The shares will be issued on December 22, 2016. The Company recorded compensation expense associated with
the award of $100,000 and $300,000, respectively, during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016. The Company
recorded compensation expense associated with a similar award of $100,000 and $300,000, respectively, during the three- and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2015. 

The following table summarizes information about Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs )
activity during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016: 

During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recorded compensation expense related to RSUs of approximately $95,000 and $82,000, respectively. During the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded compensation expense related to RSUs of approximately $254,000 and $231,000,
respectively. 

At the Company s discretion, RSU holders are given the option to net-share
settle to cover the required minimum withholding tax, and the remaining amount is converted into the equivalent number of common
shares. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 3,889 and 3,405 shares were surrendered at an average
market price of $22.82 and $23.15, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately
$947,000 of unrecognized compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 3.5 years . 

(5)     Inventories     

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable
value, and consist of the following at the stated dates (in thousands): 

(6)     Preferred Stock     

On March 18, 2009, the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right (a  Right ) for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to the stockholders of record
on March 20, 2009. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Preferred Share ) of the Company, at
a price of $25 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share subject to adjustment and the terms of the Rights Agreement. The Rights
expire on March 19, 2019. 

(7)     Income Per Share     

Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding. Diluted income per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive
common stock equivalent shares outstanding during each period. 

The weighted average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted net
income per share consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential
exercise of stock awards, including stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise
price of the related options during the period. These outstanding stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted income
per share because the effect would be antidilutive. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of
stock awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for this reason was 35,193 and 65,193, respectively. For
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of stock awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
per share for this reason was 52,377 and 82,719, respectively. 

(8)     Segment Reporting     

The Company consists of a single operating and reportable
segment. 

Revenues from customers outside of the United States are not material. No customer
comprised more than 10% of the Company s consolidated revenues for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016. All of the Company s assets are located in the United States. 

The Company s products are primarily sold
to customers within the Medical, Automotive, Consumer, Electronics, Industrial, and Aerospace and Defense markets. Net sales by
market for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands) : 

Note   certain amounts for the three- and nine-months ended September
30, 2015 were reclassified between markets to conform to the current period presentation. 

(9)     Other Intangible Assets     

The carrying values of the Company s definite lived intangible assets
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands): 

Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately $79,000
for each of the three- month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and approximately $238,000 for each of the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The estimated remaining amortization expense as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (in thousands): 

The income tax expense included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of income principally relates to the Company s proportionate share of the pre-tax income of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The determination of income tax expense for interim reporting purposes is based upon the estimated effective tax rate for the year,
adjusted for the impact of any discrete items which are accounted for in the period in which they occur. 

The Company recorded tax expense of approximately 35% of income before income
tax expense for each of the  three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company
recorded tax expense of approximately 35.4% and 35% of income before income tax expense for the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 is due
to a tax assessment of approximately $40,000 from one jurisdiction recorded in the first quarter of 2016.  

(11)     Plant
Consolidations      

Restructuring Costs  

On March 18, 2015, the Company committed to move forward with a plan to cease
operations at its Raritan, New Jersey, plant and consolidate operations into its Newburyport, Massachusetts, facility and other
UFP facilities. The Company s decision was in response to a continued decline in business at the Raritan facility and the
recent purchase of the 137,000-square-foot facility in Newburyport. The activities related to this consolidation were substantially
complete at December 31, 2015. 

The Company also relocated all operations of its Haverhill, Massachusetts,
and Byfield, Massachusetts facilities and plans to relocate certain operations of its Georgetown, Massachusetts facility to Newburyport.
The Haverhill and Byfield relocations were complete at December 31, 2015, and the Georgetown relocation is substantially complete. 

The Company expects to incur approximately $2.1 million in one-time expenses
in connection with the Massachusetts consolidations. Included in this amount are approximately $180,000 relating to employee severance
payments and relocation costs, approximately $1.5 million in moving expenses and expenses associated with vacating the Raritan,
Haverhill, and Byfield properties, and approximately $360,000 in lease termination costs. Total cash charges are estimated at $2.0
million. The Company expects annual cost savings of approximately $1.0 million as a result of these consolidations. Through September
30, 2016, the Company had incurred approximately $1.9 million of the costs for this restructuring plan. 

The company recorded the following restructuring costs associated with the
Massachusetts consolidations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

On July 16, 2014, the Company committed to move forward with a plan to cease
operations at its Costa Mesa, California, plant and consolidate operations into its Rancho Dominguez, California, facility and
other UFP facilities. The Company s decision was in response to the December 31, 2014, expiration of the lease on the Costa
Mesa facility as well as the close proximity of the two properties. The California consolidation is complete. 

The company recorded the following restructuring costs associated with the California
consolidation for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Costs for 2016 were reclassified in the Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Income as  Restructuring Costs  from Cost of Sales. Costs for the three months ended September 30, 2015
were reclassified in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income as  Restructuring Costs  from Cost of Sales. Costs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were reclassified in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income as  Restructuring
Costs  as follows: $941,000 from Cost of Sales and $18,000 from General and Administrative expenses:

(13)     Material
Overcharge Settlement     

The Company was a participant in a class action lawsuit against a number of
polyurethane foam suppliers ( Defendants ) that recently reached settlement. The suit was filed to recover damages
and obtain injunctive relief for Defendants  alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws with respect to the fixing
of prices of polyurethane foam sold from January 1, 1999 through August 2010. The Company recorded gains of approximately $1.7
million and $2.1 million during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which represents the
full settlement amount received. The settlement amount is recorded as  Material overcharge settlement  in the operating
income section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

UFP Technologies is an innovative designer and custom converter of foams, plastics, composites,
and natural fiber products, principally serving the medical, automotive, consumer, electronics, industrial, and aerospace and defense
markets. The Company consists of a single operating and reportable segment. 

Strong third quarter growth in sales to customers in the medical, consumer and automotive
markets were partially offset by weakness in demand from customers in the military and electronics markets. The Company anticipates
continued growth in sales to customers in the medical market. Continued manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from recent plant
consolidations and the resulting need to requalify parts with many of the Company s customers in the medical market caused
an increase in material and labor costs that negatively impacted gross margins. The Company anticipates that these increases will
be temporary and that gross margins will improve as new employees get trained and parts get requalified. 

The Company s current strategy includes organic growth and growth through strategic
acquisitions .   

Results of Operations  

Sales  

Sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately 8.1%
to $37.2 million from sales of $34.4 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in sales for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of increases in sales to customers in the medical, consumer and automotive markets of
approximately 19.4%, 18.5% and 11.0%, respectively, partially offset by decreases in sales to customers in the aerospace  
defense and electronics markets of approximately 28.7% and 12.7%, respectively. The increase in sales to customers in the medical
market was largely due to a new five-year contract with one of the Company s larger customers in this market as well as an
overall increase in demand from other medical customers. The increase in sales to customers in the consumer market was largely
due to increased demand for molded fiber protective packaging for consumer products. The increase in sales to customers in the
automotive market was primarily due to increased demand for interior trim parts from a customer in the southeast, resulting from
the customer resolving certain production issues. The reduction in sales to customers in the aerospace and defense market was largely
due to continued cuts in government spending. The decrease in sales to customers in the electronics market was primarily due to
a temporary spike in demand for packaging at one of our larger customers in 2015. 

Sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately 4.5%
to $109.6 million from sales of $104.9 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in sales for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of increases in sales to customers in the medical and consumer markets of approximately
14.9% and 22.9%, respectively, partially offset by decreases in sales to customers in the aerospace   defense and consumer
markets of approximately 25.9% and 14.1%, respectively. The increase in sales to customers in the medical market was largely due
to a new five-year contract with one of the Company s larger customers in this market as well as an overall increase in demand
from other medical customers. The increase in sales to customers in the consumer market was largely due to increased demand for
molded fiber protective packaging for consumer products. The reduction in sales to customers in the aerospace and defense market
was largely due to continued cuts in government spending. The decrease in sales to customers in the electronics market was primarily
due to general softness in demand for protective packaging. 

Gross Profit  

Gross profit as a percentage of sales ( gross margin ) decreased to 22.7%
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, from 27.6% for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of sales, material
and labor costs collectively increased 2.9%, while overhead increased 2.0%. The increase in collective material and labor costs
as a percentage of sales is primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from recent plant consolidations and the resulting
need to requalify parts with many of the Company s customers in the medical market. The increase in overhead is primarily
due to an increase in indirect labor costs of approximately $635,000 due largely to temporary hires to assist in the requalification
of parts, an increase in plant and equipment maintenance costs of approximately $365,000 due largely to one-time costs associated
with the plant consolidations and an increase in depreciation of approximately $164,000 due largely to depreciation on the Company s
new building in Newburyport. 

Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 24.1% for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016, from 27.1% for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of sales, material and labor costs collectively increased
2.4%, while overhead increased 0.6%. The increase in collective material and labor costs as a percentage of sales is primarily
due to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from recent plant consolidations and the resulting need to requalify parts with many
of the Company s customers in the medical market, as well as a non-recurring write-off of approximately $288,000 in obsolete
tooling and inventory. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG A ) increased approximately
7.5% to $6.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, from $5.6 million for the same period in 2015. As a percentage
of sales, SG A decreased to 16.2% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, from 16.3% for the same three-month
period in 2015. The increase in SG A for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, is primarily due to one-time consulting
and recruiting costs associated with filling open positions and company-wide training. The decrease in SG A as a percentage
of sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, is largely due to the leveraging of relatively fixed SG A expenses
against the increase in sales. 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG A ) was unchanged
at $18.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same nine-month period in 2015. As a percentage
of sales, SG A decreased to 16.8% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, from 17.5% for the same nine-month period
in 2015. The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, is largely due to
the leveraging of relatively fixed SG A expenses against the increase in sales. 

Restructuring Costs  

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred restructuring
costs of approximately $25,000, compared to approximately $851,000 for the same period in 2015. 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred restructuring
costs of approximately $203,000, compared to approximately $1.0 million for the same period in 2015. 

Additional information regarding restructuring costs can be found in Note 11 of the Notes
to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Material Overcharge Settlement  

The Company was a participant in a class action lawsuit against a number of polyurethane
foam suppliers ( Defendants ) that recently reached settlement. The suit was filed to recover damages and obtain injunctive
relief for Defendants  alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws with respect to the fixing of prices of polyurethane
foam sold from January 1, 1999 through August 2010. The Company recorded gains of approximately $1.7 million and $2.1 million during
the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which represents the full settlement amount received.
The settlement amount is recorded as  Material overcharge settlement  in the operating income section of the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Interest Income and Expense  

The Company had net interest income of approximately $25,000 and $9,000 for the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company had net interest income of approximately $51,000 and net interest
expense of approximately $7,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net
interest income is primarily due to an increase in interest earned on money market accounts and certificates of deposit and decreasing
interest costs on the Company s term loans. 

Income Taxes  

The Company s effective tax rate was approximately 35.0% for each of the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s effective tax rate was approximately 35.4% and 35.0% for the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016 is due to a tax assessment of approximately $40,000 from one jurisdiction recorded in the first quarter of 2016.
The Company has deferred tax assets on its books associated with net operating losses generated in previous years. The Company
has considered both positive and negative available evidence in its determination that the deferred tax assets are more likely
than not to be realized, and has not recorded a tax valuation allowance at September 30, 2016. The Company will continue to assess
whether the deferred tax assets will be realizable and, when appropriate, will record a valuation allowance against these assets.
The amount of the net deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future
taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company generally funds its operating expenses, capital requirements, and growth
plan through internally generated cash and bank credit facilities. 

Cash Flows  

Net cash provided by operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $6.6 million and was primarily a result of net income generated of $6.5 million, depreciation and amortization of
approximately $4.1 million, share-based compensation of $0.9 million, an increase in deferred taxes of $0.2 million, an increase
in accounts payable of approximately $0.5 million due to the timing of vendor payments in the ordinary course of business and a
decrease in refundable income taxes of approximately $0.8 million. These cash inflows and adjustments to income were partially
offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $4.8 million due in part to strong September sales, an increase in
prepaid expenses of approximately $1.2 million due to upfront insurance premium payments and an increase in inventories of approximately
$0.4 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30,
2016 was approximately $6.1 million and was primarily the result of additions of manufacturing machinery and equipment and the
renovations of the new manufacturing and headquarters building in Massachusetts. 

Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $192,000 during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, representing cash used to service term debt of approximately $758,000 and to pay statutory withholding
for stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested of approximately $89,000, largely offset by excess tax benefits on
share-based compensation of approximately $126,000 and net proceeds received upon stock options exercises of approximately $529,000. 

Outstanding and Available Debt  

The Company maintains an unsecured $40 million revolving credit facility with Bank of
America, N.A. The credit facility calls for interest of LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.0% to 1.5% or, at the discretion
of the Company, the bank s prime rate less a margin that ranges from 0.25% to zero. In both cases the applicable margin is
dependent upon Company performance. Under the credit facility, the Company is subject to a minimum fixed-charge coverage financial
covenant as well as a maximum total funded debt to EBITDA financial covenant. The Company s $40 million credit facility matures
on November 30, 2018. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit
facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility. 

In 2012, the Company financed the purchase of two molded
fiber machines through five-year term loans that mature in September 2017. The annual interest rate is fixed at 1.83% and the loans
are secured by the related molded fiber machines. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the term loan facility was
approximately $1.1 million  .   

Future Liquidity  

The Company requires cash to pay its operating expenses, purchase capital equipment,
and to service its contractual obligations. The Company s principal sources of funds are its operations and its revolving
credit facility. The Company generated cash of approximately $6.6 million from operations during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016; however, the Company cannot guarantee that its operations will generate cash in future periods. The Company s longer-term
liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. 

Throughout fiscal 2016, the Company plans to continue to add capacity to enhance operating
efficiencies in its manufacturing plants. The Company may also further expand its Newburyport, Massachusetts, manufacturing plant.
The Company may consider additional acquisitions of companies, technologies, or products that are complementary to its business.
The Company believes that its existing resources, including its revolving credit facility, together with cash expected to be generated
from operations and funds expected to be available to it through any necessary equipment financings and additional bank borrowings,
will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements, including capital asset acquisitions, through the next twelve months. 

Stock Repurchase Program  

On June 16, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to $10.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase
shares through Rule 10b5-1 plans, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance
with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stock repurchase program
will end upon the earlier of the date on which the plan is terminated by the Board or when all authorized repurchases are completed.
The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon our evaluation of market conditions and other
factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and the Company has no obligation
to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the program. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under
this program in the first nine months of 2016. Through September 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased a total of 29,559 shares
of its common stock under this program at a cost of approximately $587,000. At September 30, 2016, approximately $9.4 million was
available for future repurchases of the Company s common stock under this authorization.

during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.
