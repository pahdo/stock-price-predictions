In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  will ,  should ,  could ,  expects ,  plans ,  intends ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,  potential  or  continue  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements. The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things: our ability to continue licensing and integrate the technology from Ocure Ltd. Into the Company s business and the Company s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, and other factors over which we have little or no control; and other factors discussed in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).     Our management has included projections and estimates in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

     Table of Contents           MADISON VENTURES INC.     Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)     As of September 30, 2016       1.   Condensed financial statements      The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting which conforms to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the instructions for Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnote disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stockholders equity in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.     The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2016, which is derived from the Company's audited financial statements, the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and cash flows for the Six Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the period of March 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 and are included in this document. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the March 31, 2016 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s most recent Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, 2016.     Operating results for the Six Months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.      2. Nature of operations      Madison Ventures Inc. ( Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on September 14, 2009 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. The Company initially was engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties. On February 27, 2015, the Company terminated the acquisition of the mineral claim and entered into a letter of intent with Ocure Ltd. ( Ocure ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to exclusively license certain technology from Ocure related to the development of products and devices for the treatment of anal fissures and on August 5, 2015, entered into an exclusive license agreement to Ocure s semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure (the  Ocure License ). On July 9, 2015, the Company established the wholly-owned subsidiary Madison-IL Ltd., incorporated under the laws of the country of Israel to address the Company s requirement for an Israeli company to operate and hold the assets associated with Ocure License. However, the Company has not made all payments required under the Ocure License and is in breach of that agreement, although Ocure has not provided formal notice of termination. The Company has no revenues and has limited operating history.     The success of the Company is dependent upon the development of products for the treatment of anal fissures, the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete the acquisition, development and commercialize of the Licensed Technology, and upon future profitable operations.      Use of Estimates and Assumptions      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. The Company is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred income tax asset valuations and loss contingences. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.                 9       
     Table of Contents           MADISON VENTURES INC.    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    As of September 30, 2016       2. Nature of operations (continued)       License Agreement      On February 27, 2015, we entered into a letter of intent (the  Letter of Intent ) with Ocure Ltd. ( Ocure ), an Israeli corporation, pursuant to which the Company would be obligated to exclusively license certain technology from Ocure under terms of a license agreement to be negotiated between the Company and Ocure. The Letter of Intent terminated when the Company did not make the second required payment, however the Company continued to negotiate with Ocure. On August 5, 2015, as amended February 26, 2016, the company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the  License Agreement ) with Ocure and Madison-IL Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in Israel on July 9, 2015 (the  Subsidiary ). Pursuant to the License Agreement, Ocure granted to the Subsidiary an exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, license (the  License ) to Ocure s semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure, pursuant to Ocure s patents and patent applications (the  Licensed Technology ) and to its production, use, import, offer for sale, sell, lease, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Licensed Technology for uses classified as medical devices, or those otherwise approved ultimately as an OTC (over-the-counter) remedy.     Under the License Agreement, the Company is obligated as consideration for the Licensed Technology to provide the Subsidiary $250,000 for the commercialization of the Licensed Technology, payable according to the following schedule: $10,000 upon execution of the Letter of Intent (paid February 27, 2015 to Ocure), $90,000 at the later of May 11, 2015 or the final signing date of the License Agreement (the  Effective Date ), and $50,000 on or before March 4, 2016, and $100,000 on or before April 8, 2016 (collectively, the  First $250,000 Tranche ). The Effective Date will occur upon satisfaction of the Condition Precedent, as defined in the License Agreement, and approval of the Agreement by the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy. The License Agreement Effective Date was November 11, 2015; the date approval of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy was received. Upon the 6-month anniversary of the Effective Date, if the Company had paid the First $250,000 Tranche, then Ocure will transfer certain assets, as defined, to the Subsidiary, and the Company will be obligated to provide the Subsidiary a second $250,000 tranche, payable as follows: $100,000 on or before August 12, 2016, $100,000 on or before September 23, 2016, and $50,000 on or before October 28, 2016. The License Agreement terminates, on a country-by-country basis, the later of: (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire of Ocure s rights in Ocure Patents in such country or such other grant of statutory exclusivity, or (b) the end of a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of making the first commercial sale, as defined, in such country; unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has advanced $221,850 and $131,850, respectively, to the Subsidiary and paid Ocure $10,000 in furtherance of the commercialization of the Licensed Technology. As such, the Company is in breach of its obligations under the License Agreement, but has not yet received notice of termination from Ocure.      Immediately after the Effective Date of the License Agreement and for the period ending March 31, 2016 (as amended), the shareholders of Ocure and certain individuals designated by Ocure had the opportunity to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,100,000 (1,775,000 presplit) shares of the Company s Common Stock at the par value of $0.001 per share. In addition, the Company will establish an incentive stock option plan reserving up to 20% of the Company s issued share capital, as of the closing. The right to purchase an aggregate of 7,100,000 (1,775,000 presplit) shares of the Company s Common Stock expired unexercised, but by mutual agreement the purchase right has been extended under similar terms.     In consideration of the license for the Licensed Technology and with respect to any inventions, improvement, development or enhancement based upon, consists of, comprises, contains or incorporates the Licensed Technology invented following the Effective Date by the Subsidiary, its affiliate or sublicensee (the  New Inventions ), the Subsidiary will pay to Ocure royalties calculated as 5% of gross sales. In addition, the Subsidiary will pay to Ocure 20% of any cash or non-cash consideration received, whether for sublicense initiation fee, annual fee, sublicense milestone payments, or other such non-sale based royalty consideration payable by a sublicense as consideration for or under a sublicense. As the Company is in breach of the License Agreement, it is highly doubtful that the terms of the License Agreement will be carried out.              MADISON VENTURES INC.    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    As of September 30, 2016       2. Nature of operations (continued)       Share-based Compensation      Codification topic 718  Stock Compensation  requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective for share-based payment transactions with employees and acquired goods or services from non-employees. The codification also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards, as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements. The Company adopted the codification upon creation of the company and will expense share based costs in the period incurred. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan or completed a share-based transaction; accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      The Company s management has evaluated all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations.      3  . Investment in technology license      On August 5, 2015, as amended February 26, 2016, the company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the  License Agreement ) with Ocure and Madison-IL Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in Israel on July 9, 2015 (the  Subsidiary ). Pursuant to the License Agreement, Ocure granted to the Subsidiary an exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, license (the  License ) to Ocure s semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure, pursuant to Ocure s patents and patent applications (the  Licensed Technology ) and to its production, use, import, offer for sale, sell, lease, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Licensed Technology for uses classified as medical devices, or those otherwise approved ultimately as an OTC (over-the-counter) remedy.     Under the License Agreement, the Company is obligated as consideration for the Licensed Technology to provide the Subsidiary $250,000 for the commercialization of the Licensed Technology, payable according to the following schedule: $10,000 upon execution of the Letter of Intent, $90,000 at the later of May 11, 2015 or the final signing date of the License Agreement (the  Effective Date ), and $50,000 on or before March 4, 2016, and $100,000 on or before April 8, 2016 (collectively, the  First $250,000 Tranche ). The License Agreement Effective Date was November 11, 2015; the date approval of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy was received. Upon the 6-month anniversary of the Effective Date, if the Company had paid the First $250,000 Tranche, then Ocure will transfer certain assets, as defined, to the Subsidiary, and the Company will be obligated to provide the Subsidiary a second $250,000 tranche, payable as follows: $100,000 on or before August 12, 2016, $100,000 on or before September 23, 2016, and $50,000 on or before October 28, 2016. The License Agreement terminates, on a country-by-country basis, the later of: (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire of Ocure s rights in Ocure Patents in such country or such other grant of statutory exclusivity, or (b) the end of a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of making the first commercial sale, as defined, in such country; unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has advanced $221,850 and $131,850, respectively, to the Subsidiary and paid Ocure $10,000 in furtherance of the commercialization of the Licensed Technology. As such, the Company is in breach of its obligations under the License Agreement, but has not yet received notice of termination from Ocure.      As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has incurred an aggregate of $234,904 and $70,998 of costs recorded as the investment in technology license, respectively.     The Company was in default of the First $250,000 Tranche aggregate payment due on April 8, 2016. Upon the six month anniversary of the Effective Date (May 11, 2016) no assets were transferred by Ocure to the Company s subsidiary. As of the date of these financial statements, the License Agreement has not been extended or amended, and there is a substantial risk the agreement will be cancelled. Accordingly the investment in the technology license of $244,904, at September 30, 2016, is impaired and the full value has been written off and recognized as an expense.

MADISON VENTURES INC.    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)    As of September 30, 2016       6. Related party transactions       Employment Agreements       On April 2, 2014, Mr. Gene Gregorio was appointed the Company s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and sole Director. On April 20, 2014, the Company agreed to issue Mr. Gregorio 1,000,000 (250,000 presplit) restricted shares of the Company s Common Stock, valued at $25,000, based on the market close, as compensation for his services for an initial term of one year (the  April 20 th  Agreement ). On March 31, 2015, the Company issued Mr. Gregorio the agreed 250,000 restricted shares of the Company s Common Stock. At March 31, 2015, $1,387 was recorded as a prepaid expense for the period April 1 to April 20, 2015.     In addition, if during the term of the April 20 th  Agreement Mr. Gregorio s direct efforts result in a consummated financing for the Company he shall be paid a 5.0% fee on such financing received by the Company, at his option, as either cash or shares of Company s Common Stock at the offering price.

Going concern      These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company anticipates future losses in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company s operating expenditure plan for the next fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 will require cash of approximately $500,000. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with the issuance of common shares and/or related party borrowings.      8. Capital stock      The Company s capitalization is 300,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, with 29,400,000 and 28,400,000 shares issued and outstanding at September 30 and March 31, 2016, respectively. On April 11, 2016, the Company effected a four for one forward stock split of our i) authorized and ii) issued and outstanding shares of common stock. All share information has been restated for all periods presented giving retroactive effect of the April 11, 2016 four to one forward stock split. Prior to the forward stock split the Company had 75,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share and 7,100 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2016 and 2015.     On August 9, 2016, the Company issued the 1,000,000 shares to Mr. Gregorio for services rendered during the period April 21, 2015 to April 20, 2016.     As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has not granted any stock options or stock warrants. As a requirement of the Ocure License Agreement, the Company will establish an incentive stock option plan reserving up to 20% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock, as of the closing of the License Agreement.              ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.       The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Madison Ventures Inc., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ), an development stage company, and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the March 31, 2016 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Form 10-K (File No. 333-188753; the  Form 10-K ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, 2016. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute  forward-looking  statements      OVERVIEW      The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. It is a development-stage company.     During early 2015, we decided to abandon our mineral exploration properties and on February 27, 2015, we entered into a letter of intent with Ocure, pursuant to which we agreed to exclusively license certain technology from Ocure related to the development of products and devices for the treatment of anal fissures under terms of a license agreement to be negotiated between us and Ocure.     On August 5, 2015, as amended February 25, 2016, our company and Madison-IL Ltd. entered into an exclusive license agreement ( License Agreement ) with Ocure to license Ocure s semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure, pursuant to Ocure s patents and patent applications and to its production, use, import, offer for sale, sell, lease, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Licensed Technology for uses classified as medical devices, or those otherwise approved ultimately as an OTC (over-the-counter) remedy.     With this licensing we intended to focus our efforts on the development of products for the treatment of anal fissures. This is now unlikely as a result of our failure to fund the development as required under the License Agreement.     Based on the Licensed Technology, we had intended to develop and produce propriety devices that present a novel approach for treating anal fissures that is safe and simple to use by patients with minimal discomfort. However, we are in default of our obligations under the Licensing Agreement and cannot be sure that it will be brought into good standing. We don t currently have the resources to pay the outstanding amounts we owe under the License Agreement, and there is a substantial risk the license we negotiated will be cancelled.       GOING CONCERN      To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. No revenues are anticipated until we complete the financing we endeavor to obtain, as described in the Form 10-K, and implement our initial business plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings.      PLAN OF OPERATION      Our intended plan of operation for the twelve months following the date of this filing was to continue to attempt to meet the conditions of the Exclusive License Agreement in order to continue licensing and integrate technology from Ocure related to the development of products and devices for the treatment of anal fissures into our business. However, we are in default of our obligations and our plan is to continue to work on raising funds to meet our obligations. Even if we raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to reinstate the License Agreement into good standing.              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Six-Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       We recorded no revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      For the six months ended September 30, 2016, total operating costs were $44,631, consisting of consulting and professional fees of $33,302, stock-based compensation of $1,387, insurance of $2,550 and general and administrative expenses of $7,392. By comparison, for the six months ended September 30, 2015, total operating costs were $43,714, consisting of $30,864 of consulting and professional fees and $12,500 of stock-based compensation and $350 in general and administrative expenses. There were net losses of $288,376 and $43,714, respectively, during these periods. The increase in net loss is due primarily to a $11,113 decrease in stock based compensation offset by a $2,550 increase in insurance, $7,042 increase in other general and administrative expenses, foreign exchange gain $1,159 and $244,904 impairment loss for technology license.       Three-Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total operating costs were $24,562, consisting of consulting and professional fees of $18,417, insurance of $2,550 and general and administrative expenses of $3,595. By comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, total operating costs were $21,887, consisting of $15,287 of consulting and professional fees and $6,250 of stock-based compensation and $350 in general and administrative expenses. There were net losses of $264,975 and $21,887, respectively, during these periods. The increase in net loss is due primarily to a $6,250 decrease in stock based compensation offset by a $2,550 increase in insurance, $3,245 increase in other general and administrative expenses, foreign exchange gain $4,491 and $244,904 impairment loss for technology license.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $28,583, total current liabilities of approximately $297,275 and working capital deficit of $265,843 and a stockholders  deficit of approximately $375,843. We do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our ongoing operational expenses. We will need to raise funds to commence fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund ongoing operational expenses. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our operations and our business will fail.              Off balance sheet arrangements       We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.       As a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3.        ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.        DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.     There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.              PART II. OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.       The Company is not currently subject to any legal proceedings. From time to time, the Company may become subject to litigation or proceedings in connection with its business, as either a plaintiff or defendant. There are no such pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party that, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.
