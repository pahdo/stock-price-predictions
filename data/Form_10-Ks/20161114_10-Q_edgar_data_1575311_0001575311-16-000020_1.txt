Note 1 Organization and Description of Business 
    
  Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. ( Brookfield DTLA  or the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013.  Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended (the  Merger Agreement ), and the issuance of shares of   7.625%   Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the  Series A preferred stock ) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together,  MPG ).  Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC ( Brookfield DTLA Holdings ), a Delaware limited liability company, and an indirect subsidiary of Brookfield Office Properties Inc. ( BPO ). 
    
  Brookfield DTLA owns BOA Plaza, EY Plaza, Wells Fargo Center North Tower, Wells Fargo Center South Tower, Gas Company Tower and 777 Tower, each of which are Class A office properties located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the  LACBD ). 
    
  Brookfield DTLA receives its income primarily from rental income (including tenant reimbursements) generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, from its parking garages. 

Note 2     Basis of Presentation 
    
  As used in these condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms  Brookfield DTLA,  the  Company,   us,   we  and  our  refer to Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation and Combination and Basis of Presentation 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) applicable to interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of only those of a normal and recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and interim results of Brookfield DTLA as of and for the periods presented have been included.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those that may be expected for a full fiscal year. 
    
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from Brookfield DTLA s audited financial statements; however, the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required by GAAP.

BROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC. 
    
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The financial information included herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Brookfield DTLA s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on   March 28, 2016  . 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  In December 2015, Brookfield DTLA adopted the guidance in Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  We have combined the amortization of deferred financing costs (  $901  ) and the amortization of debt discounts (  $2,896  ) and presented a new total (  $3,797  ) in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   so as to reflect the presentation of such costs in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  For example, estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to fair values of assets and liabilities for applying the acquisition method of accounting, the useful lives of assets, recoverable amounts of receivables, impairment of long-lived assets and fair value of debt.  Actual results could ultimately differ from such estimates. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09 establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    ASU 2014-09 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.    This topic provides guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and requires related footnote disclosures.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements.

  (Unaudited) 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   to     ASC Topic 810  , Consolidation  .  ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain entities.  The guidance in ASU 2015-02 became effective for Brookfield DTLA beginning January 1, 2016.  The implementation of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to being presented as assets.  Brookfield DTLA elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 effective as of December 31, 2015.  There was no effect on our consolidated statements of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of adopting this pronouncement. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   to ASC Topic 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  .  ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Brookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), commencing with its tax period ended December 31, 2013.  Brookfield DTLA conducts and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT.  Accordingly, Brookfield DTLA is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to qualify as a REIT and distributions to its stockholders, if any, generally equal or exceed its taxable income.  Brookfield DTLA has elected to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ).  Certain activities that we undertake must be conducted by a TRS, such as non-customary services for our tenants, and holding assets that we cannot hold directly.  A TRS is subject to both federal and state income taxes.

BROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC. 
    
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon Brookfield DTLA s ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code related to annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Brookfield DTLA will be organized or be able to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify as a REIT.  If Brookfield DTLA fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates, and it may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years.  Brookfield DTLA may also be subject to certain state or local income taxes, or franchise taxes on its REIT activities.  
    
  Brookfield DTLA made   no   provision for income taxes in its condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Brookfield DTLA s taxable income or loss is different than its financial statement income or loss. 
    
  Brookfield DTLA recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.  Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold.  Brookfield DTLA had   no   unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and Brookfield DTLA does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits balance to change during the next 12 months.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA s 2013 tax period and 2014 and 2015 tax years remain open due to the statute of limitations and may be subject to examination by federal, state and local authorities.  The 2012 tax year as well as the short tax period ended October 15, 2013 for Brookfield DTLA and its subsidiaries remain open due to the statute of limitations and may be subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities.

As required by the loan agreement, we have entered into an interest rate cap agreement that limits the LIBOR portion of the interest rate to   4.75%  .  Brookfield DTLA has   two   options to extend the maturity date of the loan, each for a period of   one   year, subject to meeting certain debt yield and loan to value ratios (as specified in the loan agreement).  As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not meet the criteria specified in the loan agreement to extend this loan on its contractual maturity date.

    This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus   2.18%  .  As required by the loan agreement, we have entered into an interest rate cap agreement that limits the LIBOR portion of the interest rate to   5.75%  .  Brookfield DTLA has   two   options to extend the maturity date of the loan, each for a period of   one   year, subject to meeting certain debt yield and loan to value ratios (as specified in the loan agreement).   
              (3) 
    This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus   2.25%  .  Brookfield DTLA has   two   options to extend the maturity date of this loan, each for a period of   12   months, subject to meeting certain debt yield and loan to value ratios (as specified in the loan agreement).   
              (4) 
    This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus   1.75%  .  As required by the loan agreement, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge this loan, which effectively fixes the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at   2.178%  .  The effective interest rate of   3.93%   includes interest on the swap. 
       
  Debt Refinanced 
    
  On   July 11, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA Holdings refinanced the   $458.0 million   mortgage loan secured by Gas Company Tower.  In connection with the refinancing, Brookfield DTLA Holdings repaid   $8.0 million   of principal and was required to fund various loan reserves, including a   $20.7 million   tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve, a   $4.5 million   rent concession reserve, and a   $3.0 million   tax reserve at closing.  During July 2016, the Company received   $37.0 million   in cash contributions from Brookfield DTLA Holdings, of which   $19.7 million   was used to pay for costs associated with the refinancing of Gas Company Tower.  
    
  The new   $450.0 million   mortgage loan is comprised of a   $319.0 million   senior loan and a   $131.0 million   mezzanine loan, which bear interest at fixed rates equal to   3.4727%   and   6.50%  , respectively, mature on   August 6, 2021  , and require the payment of interest-only until maturity.  The senior loan is locked out from prepayment until   September 6, 2017  , after which it can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment penalties (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until   April 6, 2021   after which the loan can be repaid without penalty.  The mezzanine loan is locked out from prepayment until   September 6, 2017  , after which the loan can be repaid, in whole or in part, without penalty.   
    
  Debt Modification

Debt Maturities 
    
  As Brookfield DTLA s debt matures, principal payment obligations present significant future cash requirements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt to be repaid during the remainder of   2016  , the next four years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $506.8 million   of our debt may be prepaid without penalty,   $550.0 million   may be prepaid with prepayment penalties or defeased (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) at our option,   $400.0 million   may be defeased (as defined in the underlying loan agreement),   $220.0 million   may be prepaid with prepayment penalties, and   $450.0 million   is locked out from prepayment until   September 6, 2017  .   
    
  Wells Fargo Center South Tower  
    
  Brookfield DTLA currently intends to refinance the   $290.0 million   mortgage loan secured by Wells Fargo Center South Tower on or about its   December 1, 2016   maturity date.  We do not have a commitment from the lenders to extend the maturity date of or to refinance this loan.  As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not meet the criteria specified in the loan agreement to extend this loan on its contractual maturity date.  
    
  This loan will most likely require a paydown upon extension or refinancing (depending on market conditions), funding of additional reserve amounts, or both.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA anticipates the need for additional cash of approximately   $51 million   to complete the refinancing.  We may use cash on hand to make any such payments or cash received as a capital contribution from Brookfield DTLA Holdings.  If we are unable or unwilling to use cash on hand or do not use cash contributed by Brookfield DTLA Holdings to make such payments, we may face challenges in repaying, extending or refinancing this loan on favorable terms or at all, and we may be forced to give back the asset to the lenders.

  Non-Recourse Carve Out Guarantees 
    
  All of Brookfield DTLA s   $2.1 billion   of mortgage debt is subject to  non-recourse carve out  guarantees that expire upon elimination of the underlying loan obligations.  Under these guarantees, these otherwise non recourse loans can become partially or fully recourse against Brookfield DTLA Holdings if certain triggering events occur as defined in the loan agreements.   
    
  Debt Reporting  
    
  Pursuant to the terms of certain of our mortgage loan agreements, Brookfield DTLA is required to report a debt service coverage ratio ( DSCR ) calculated using the formulas specified in the underlying loan agreements.  We have submitted the required reports to the lenders for the measurement periods ended   September 30, 2016   and were in compliance with the amounts required by the loan agreements.  
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Wells Fargo Center South Tower, Wells Fargo Center North Tower, EY Plaza, and Figueroa at 7th mortgage loan agreements, we are required to provide annual audited financial statements of Brookfield DTLA Holdings to the lenders or agents.  The receipt of any opinion other than an  unqualified  audit opinion on our annual audited financial statements is an event of default under the loan agreements for the properties listed above.  If an event of default occurs, the lenders have the right to pursue the remedies contained in the loan documents, including acceleration of all or a portion of the debt and foreclosure.

Note 7   Mezzanine Equity 
    
  Mezzanine equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the Series A preferred stock, a Series A-1 preferred interest, a senior participating preferred interest and, as of   September 30, 2016  , a Series B preferred interest (collectively, the  Preferred Interests ).  The Series A-1 preferred interest, senior participating preferred interest and Series B preferred interest are held by a noncontrolling interest holder.  The Preferred Interests are classified in mezzanine equity because they are callable, and the holder of the Series A-1 preferred interest, senior participating preferred interest, Series B preferred interest, and some of the Series A preferred stock indirectly controls the ability to elect to redeem such instruments, through its controlling interest in the Company and its subsidiaries.  There is no commitment or obligation on the part of Brookfield DTLA or Brookfield DTLA Holdings to redeem the Preferred Interests.  See   Series B Preferred Interest  below for a discussion of the issuance of the Series B preferred interest during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Preferred Interests included within mezzanine equity were recorded at fair value on the date of issuance and have been adjusted to the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Adjustments to increase the carrying amount to redemption value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as a redemption measurement adjustment. 
    
  Dividends and Distributions 
    
  On   January 4, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA paid a cash dividend of   $2.25   per share to holders of record of its Series A preferred stock at the close of business on   December 15, 2015   using cash on hand.  This dividend payment reduced the accumulated and unpaid dividends owed on the Series A preferred stock by   $21.9 million  .  Any future dividends declared would be at the discretion of Brookfield DTLA s board of directors and would depend on its financial condition, results of operations, contractual obligations and the terms of its financing agreements at the time a dividend is considered, and other relevant factors. 
    
  On   April 5, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA made a   $0.3 million   cash distribution to Brookfield DTLA Holdings as a return of investment related to the senior participating preferred interest held by Brookfield DTLA Holdings using cash on hand.

Series A Preferred Stock 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   9,730,370   shares of Series A preferred stock were outstanding, of which   9,357,469   shares were issued to third parties and   372,901   shares were issued to DTLA Fund Holding Co., a subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings.   
    
  On   January 4, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA paid a cash dividend of   $2.25   per share to holders of record of its Series A preferred stock at the close of business on   December 15, 2015   using cash on hand.  This dividend payment reduced the accumulated and unpaid dividends owed on the Series A preferred stock by   $21.9 million  .  The dividend was declared on   December 4, 2015   by the board of directors in connection with the settlement on a class-wide basis of the litigation brought in Maryland State Court and styled as   In re MPG Office Trust Inc. Preferred Shareholder Litigation  , Case No. 24-C-13-004097.  See   Note 13    Commitments and Contingencies Litigation Merger-Related Litigation  for additional information regarding the dividend payment. 
    
  No   dividends were declared on the Series A preferred stock during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Dividends on the Series A preferred stock are cumulative, and therefore, will continue to accrue at an annual rate of   $1.90625   per share.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative amount of unpaid dividends totals   $125.0 million   and has been reflected in the carrying amount of the Series A preferred stock. 
    
  The Series A preferred stock does not have a stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions.  Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Series A preferred stock will rank senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of distributions.  We may, at our option, redeem the Series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price of   $25.00   per share, plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such Series A preferred stock up to and including the redemption date.  The Series A preferred stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of Brookfield DTLA. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Series A preferred stock is reported at its redemption value of   $368.2 million   calculated using the redemption price of   $25.00   per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such Series A preferred stock through   September 30, 2016  .

  Merger-Related Litigation  
    
  Following the announcement of the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended (the  Merger Agreement ),   seven   putative class actions were filed against Brookfield Office Properties Inc. ( BPO ), Brookfield DTLA, Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Inc., Brookfield DTLA Fund Properties (collectively, the  Brookfield Parties ), MPG Office Trust, Inc., MPG Office, L.P., and the members of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors.    Five   of these lawsuits were filed on behalf of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s common stockholders: (i)   two   lawsuits, captioned   Coyne v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al  ., No. BC507342 (the  Coyne Action ), and   Masih v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al.  , No. BC507962 (the  Masih Action ), were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in Los Angeles County (the  California State Court ) on April 29, 2013 and May 3, 2013, respectively; and (ii)   three   lawsuits, captioned   Kim v. MPG Office Trust, Inc. et al  ., No. 24 C-13-002600 (the  Kim Action ),   Perkins v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al.  , No. 24-C-13-002778 (the  Perkins Action ) and   Dell Osso v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al.,   No. 24 C-13-003283 (the  Dell Osso Action ) were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland on May 1, 2013, May 8, 2013 and May 22, 2013, respectively (collectively, the  Common Stock Actions ).    Two   lawsuits, captioned   Cohen v. MPG Office Trust, Inc. et al.  , No. 24-C-13-004097 (the  Cohen Action ) and   Donlan v. Weinstein, et al  ., No. 24 C-13-004293 (the  Donlan Action ), were filed on behalf of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s preferred stockholders in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland on June 20, 2013 and July 2, 2013, respectively (collectively, the  Preferred Stock Actions ). In each of the Common Stock Actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger by failing to maximize the value of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and ignoring or failing to protect against conflicts of interest, and that the relevant Brookfield Parties named as defendants aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty.  The Kim Action further alleges that MPG Office, L.P. also aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors, and the Dell Osso Action further alleges that MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors.  On June 4, 2013, the Kim and Perkins plaintiffs filed identical, amended complaints in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland.  On June 5, 2013, the Masih plaintiffs also filed an amended complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California in Los Angeles County.  The   three   amended complaints, as well as the Dell Osso Action complaint, allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by MPG Office Trust, Inc. with the SEC on May 21, 2013 is false and/or misleading because it fails to include certain details of the process leading up to the merger and fails to provide adequate information concerning MPG Office Trust, Inc. s financial advisors.

In each of the Preferred Stock Actions, which were brought on behalf of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s preferred stockholders, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that, by entering into the Merger Agreement and tender offer, MPG Office Trust, Inc. breached the Articles Supplementary, which governs the issuance of the MPG preferred shares, that MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to a merger agreement that violated the preferred stockholders  contractual rights and that the relevant Brookfield Parties named as defendants aided and abetted those breaches of contract and fiduciary duty.  On July 15, 2013, the plaintiffs in the Preferred Stock Actions filed a joint amended complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland that further alleged that MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors failed to disclose material information regarding BPO s extension of the tender offer.  
    
  The plaintiffs in the   seven   lawsuits sought an injunction against the merger, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the merger was consummated, an award of fees and costs, including attorneys  and experts  fees, and other relief. 
    
  On July 10, 2013, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, the Brookfield Parties and the other named defendants in the Common Stock Actions signed a memorandum of understanding, regarding a proposed settlement of all claims asserted therein.  The parties subsequently entered into a stipulation of settlement dated November 21, 2013 providing for the release of all asserted claims, additional disclosures by MPG concerning the merger made prior to the merger s approval, and the payment, by the defendants, of an award of attorneys  fees and expenses in an amount not to exceed   $475,000  .  After a hearing on June 4, 2014, the California State Court granted plaintiffs  motion for final approval of the settlement, and entered a Final Order and Judgment, awarding the plaintiffs  counsel s attorneys  fees and expenses in the amount of   $475,000  , which was paid by MPG Office LLC on June 18, 2014.   
    
  On   July 13, 2016  , BPO and the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the insurance carrier under the MPG directors and officers liability insurance policy that was in effect at the time of the merger.  On   August 17, 2016  , the Company received a settlement totaling   $1,106,344  , which partially reimbursed the Company for amounts paid to settle both the Common Stock Actions and the Preferred Stock Actions.  The Company included the settlement in interest and other revenue in its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  In the Preferred Stock Actions, at a hearing on July 24, 2013, the Maryland State Court denied the plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the tender offer.  The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on November 22, 2013 that added additional arguments in support of their allegations that the new preferred shares do not have the same rights as the MPG preferred shares.  The defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on December 20, 2013, and briefing on the motion concluded on February 28, 2014.  At a hearing on June 18, 2014, the Maryland State Court heard oral arguments on the defendants  motion to dismiss and reserved judgment on the decision.  On October 21, 2014, the parties sent a joint letter to the Maryland State Court stating that since the June 18 meeting, the parties have commenced discussions towards a possible resolution of the lawsuit, requesting that the court temporarily refrain from deciding the pending motion to dismiss to facilitate the discussions.

On March 30, 2015, the plaintiff in the Cohen Action and the defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding setting forth an agreement in principle to settle the Preferred Stock Actions on a class-wide basis and dismiss the case with prejudice in exchange for the payment of   $2.25   per share of Series A preferred stock of accumulated and unpaid dividends (the  Dividend Payment ) to holders of record on a record date to be set after final approval of the settlement by the Maryland State Court, plus any attorneys  fees awarded by the Maryland State Court to the plaintiff s counsel.  The dividend will reduce the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A preferred stock, and the terms of the Series A preferred stock will otherwise remain unchanged.   
    
  On August 18, 2015, the Maryland State Court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and scheduling a final fairness hearing for October 27, 2015.  On September 28, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for final certification of the settlement class, final approval of the class action settlement and approval of attorneys  fees and reimbursement of expenses, seeking a total fee and expense award of   $5,250,000  .  The defendants submitted their opposition to the plaintiff s fee application on October 13, 2015. 
    
  On October 16, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking discovery related to the valuation of the Dividend Payment in connection with its fee application and served related discovery requests on the defendants.  On October 23, 2015, the defendants filed their opposition to that motion, as well as a motion for a protective order precluding discovery.  On October 27, 2015, the Maryland State Court held a hearing to decide whether to grant final approval of the settlement and to rule on the parties  discovery motions.  At the hearing, the Court ordered limited discovery to occur prior to ruling on the fee application.  
    
  On October 28, 2015, the Maryland State Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement.  The time to appeal the order expired on November 30, 2015 without any appeals having been filed.  On   December 4, 2015  , in accordance with the final approval order and the terms of the parties  settlement agreement, the board of directors declared a cash dividend of   $2.25   per share to holders of record of its Series A preferred stock at the close of business on   December 15, 2015  .  On   January 4, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA paid the Dividend Payment totaling   $21.9 million   using cash on hand. 
    
  On December 16, 2015, after taking certain limited discovery permitted by the Maryland State Court during the October 27 hearing, the plaintiff served the defendants with its reply memorandum of law in support of its motion for attorneys  fees and expenses.  That same day, the plaintiff requested that the Court permit it to file the reply memorandum and an exhibit thereto under seal given the confidential nature of the information contained therein.  On December 17, 2015, the plaintiff provided the Court with plaintiff s counsel s time records for the Court s in camera review.  On January 15, 2016, the defendants filed a surreply to the plaintiff s reply memorandum after obtaining the Court s permission to do so.  After a hearing on April 6, 2016, the Maryland State Court issued an order on   April 18, 2016   granting an award of attorneys  fees and expenses to the plaintiffs totaling   $2,212,688  .  On   April 21, 2016  , the Company paid the awarded amount to the plaintiffs  counsel.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear in Part I, Item 1.  Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview and Background 
    
  Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. ( Brookfield DTLA  or the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013.  Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended (the  Merger Agreement ), and the issuance of shares of   7.625%   Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the  Series A preferred stock ) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together,  MPG ).  Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC ( Brookfield DTLA Holdings ), a Delaware limited liability company, and an indirect subsidiary of Brookfield Office Properties Inc. ( BPO ). 
    
  Brookfield DTLA owns BOA Plaza, EY Plaza, Wells Fargo Center North Tower, Wells Fargo Center South Tower, Gas Company Tower and 777 Tower, each of which are Class A office properties located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the  LACBD ). 
    
  Brookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), commencing with its tax period ended December 31, 2013.  Brookfield DTLA conducts and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT.  Accordingly, Brookfield DTLA is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to qualify as a REIT and distributions to its stockholders, if any, generally equal or exceed its taxable income.  Brookfield DTLA has elected to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ).  Certain activities that we undertake must be conducted by a TRS, such as non-customary services for our tenants, and holding assets that we cannot hold directly.  A TRS is subject to both federal and state income taxes. 
    
  Brookfield DTLA receives its income primarily from rental income (including tenant reimbursements) generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, from its parking garages.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General 
    
  Brookfield DTLA s business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs.  The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover Brookfield DTLA s operating, financing and investing activities, resulting in  negative cash burn,  and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA s negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future.  If Brookfield DTLA s operating cash flow and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock.  In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of the holders of the Series A preferred stock.  See   Potential Uses of Liquidity Property Operations  below. 
    
  Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
    
  Brookfield DTLA s potential liquidity sources and uses are, among others, as follows: 

Sources 

Uses 

Cash on hand; 

Property operations; 

Cash generated from operations; 

Capital expenditures; 

Contributions from Brookfield  
    DTLA Holdings; and 

Payments in connection with loans;  

Proceeds from additional secured or  unsecured debt financings. 

Distributions to Brookfield    DTLA Holdings; and  

Dividend payment in connection 
    with legal settlement. 

Potential Sources of Liquidity    
    
  Cash on Hand    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Brookfield DTLA had cash and cash equivalents totaling   $65.5 million   and   $53.7 million  , respectively.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Cash Generated from Operations    
    
  Brookfield DTLA s cash generated from operations is primarily dependent upon (1) the occupancy level of its portfolio, (2) the rental rates achieved on its leases, and (3) the collectability of rent and other amounts billed to its tenants.  Net cash generated from operations is tied to the level of operating expenses, described below under   Potential Uses of Liquidity.  
    
  Occupancy levels.    The following table presents leasing information for Brookfield DTLA for leases in place as of   September 30, 2016  :   

__________ 
           (1) 
    Annualized rent represents the annualized monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of   September 30, 2016  .  This amount reflects total base rent before any rent abatements as of   September 30, 2016   and is shown on a net basis; thus, for any tenant under a partial gross lease, the expense stop, or under a fully gross lease, the current year operating expenses (which may be estimates as of such date), are subtracted from gross rent.  Total abatements for leases in effect as of   September 30, 2016   for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2017   are approximately   $8.0 million  , or   $1.25   per leased square foot. 
              (2) 
    Annualized rent per rentable square foot represents annualized rent as computed above, divided by leased square feet as of the same date.

The following table presents a summary of lease expirations at Brookfield DTLA for leases in place at   September 30, 2016  , plus currently available space, for the remainder of   2016  , each of the nine calendar years beginning January 1,   2017   and thereafter.  This table assumes that none of our tenants will exercise renewal options or early termination rights, if any, at or prior to their scheduled expirations.

              (2) 
    Current rent per leased square foot represents current base rent, divided by total leased square feet as of the same date. 
              (3) 
    Rent per leased square foot at expiration represents base rent, including any future rent steps, and thus represents the base rent that will be in place at lease expiration. 
       
  Rental Rates and Leasing Activity.    Average asking rental rates in the LACBD were essentially flat during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Management believes that on average the current in place rents are generally close to market in the LACBD.  
    
  The following table summarizes leasing activity at Brookfield DTLA for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Collectability of rent from our tenants.    Brookfield DTLA s rental income depends on collecting rent from its tenants, and in particular from its major tenants.  In the event of tenant defaults, Brookfield DTLA may experience delays in enforcing its rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in pursuing legal possession of the tenant s space and recovery of any amounts due from the tenant.  This is particularly true in the case of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is acting as receiver. 
    
  Contributions from Brookfield DTLA Holdings    
    
  Drawdowns under Capital Commitment  
    
  Brookfield DTLA Holdings has made a commitment to contribute up to   $260.0 million   in cash or property to Brookfield DTLA Fund Properties II LLC ( New OP ), which directly or indirectly owns the Brookfield DTLA properties, for which it will be entitled to receive a preferred return, if and when called by New OP.   
    
  On   May 16, 2016  , the Company received a   $6.0 million   cash contribution from Brookfield DTLA Holdings under this commitment, which is entitled to receive a preferred return of   9.0%  .  The Company used these funds for general corporate purposes. 
    
  On   July 11, 2016   and   July 13, 2016  , the Company received   $30.0 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively, in cash contributions from Brookfield DTLA Holdings, which are entitled to receive a preferred return of   9.0%  .  Of the   $37.0 million   contributed during July 2016,   $19.7 million   was used to pay for costs associated with the refinancing of Gas Company Tower, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.   
    
  As of November 14, 2016  ,   $217.0 million   is available to the Company under this commitment for future funding. 
    
  Other Contribution  
    
  In addition to amounts received under the commitment described above, on   April 21, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA received a   $2.5 million   capital contribution from Brookfield DTLA Holdings, which was used for general corporate purposes.  
    
  Proceeds from Additional Secured or Unsecured Debt Financings  
    
  On   September 1, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA Holdings modified the mortgage loan secured by 777 Tower, which increased the loan amount from   $200.0 million   to   $220.0 million  .  As a result of the modification, the Company received net proceeds of   $19.7 million  , which will be used for general corporate purposes.

Potential Uses of Liquidity    
    
  The following are the projected uses, and some of the potential uses, of cash in the near term.   
    
  Property Operations    
    
  BOA Plaza and EY Plaza have historically generated sufficient cash from operations to fund their operating activities.  In the future, should the cash generated by Brookfield DTLA s properties, including the properties acquired from MPG, not be sufficient to fund their operations, such cash would be provided by   Brookfield DTLA Holdings or another source of funds available to the Company or, if such cash were not made available, the Company might not have sufficient cash to fund its operations.   
    
  Brookfield DTLA Holdings has made a commitment to make future capital contributions in cash or property to New OP, which directly or indirectly owns the Brookfield DTLA properties, for up to   $260.0 million   of its future cash needs, for which it would be entitled to receive a preferred return, if and when called by New OP.   
    
  During the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received cash contributions totaling   $43.0 million   from Brookfield DTLA Holdings under the   $260.0 million   commitment.    As of November 14, 2016  ,   $217.0 million   is available to the Company under this commitment for future funding. 
    
  Capital Expenditures    
    
  Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA s properties.  Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length of the lease, the type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.   
    
  Brookfield DTLA expects that leasing activities at its properties, including the properties acquired from MPG, will require material amounts of cash for at least several years.  Excluding tenant improvements and leasing commissions, Brookfield DTLA projects spending approximately   $149 million   over the next ten years, with the majority (approximately   $123 million  ) over the next five years.  The expected expenditures include, but are not limited to, renovations and physical capital upgrades to Brookfield DTLA s properties, such as lobby renovations, upgrades to fire alarm, security and HVAC systems, and roof replacements.

Payments in Connection with Loans    
    
  Debt Refinanced  
    
  On   July 11, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA Holdings refinanced the   $458.0 million   mortgage loan secured by Gas Company Tower.  In connection with the refinancing, Brookfield DTLA Holdings repaid   $8.0 million   of principal and was required to fund various loan reserves, including a   $20.7 million   tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve, a   $4.5 million   rent concession reserve, and a   $3.0 million   tax reserve at closing.  During July 2016, the Company received   $37.0 million   in cash contributions from Brookfield DTLA Holdings, of which   $19.7 million   was used to pay for costs associated with the refinancing of Gas Company Tower.  
    
  Debt Maturities  
    
  As Brookfield DTLA s debt matures, principal payment obligations present significant future cash requirements.  Brookfield DTLA currently intends to refinance the existing mortgage loan on Wells Fargo Center North Tower on or about its scheduled maturity (April 2017) with new debt with a lower leverage ratio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA anticipates the need for additional cash of approximately   $125 million   to complete the refinancing of the Wells Fargo Center North Tower mortgage loan.   
    
  In addition, Brookfield DTLA currently intends to refinance the existing mortgage loan on Wells Fargo Center South Tower on or about its scheduled maturity (December 2016) with new debt.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not meet the criteria specified in the loan agreement to extend this loan on its contractual maturity date.  Brookfield DTLA anticipates the need for additional cash of approximately   $51 million   to complete the refinancing of the Wells Fargo Center South Tower mortgage loan.   
    
  There can be no assurance that either or both of these refinancings can be accomplished or what terms will be available in the market for these type of financings at the time of any refinancing. 
    
  Distributions to Brookfield DTLA Holdings    
    
  During the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA made a   $0.3 million   cash distribution to Brookfield DTLA Holdings as a return of investment related to the senior participating preferred interest held by Brookfield DTLA Holdings using cash on hand.    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company made no cash distributions to Brookfield DTLA Holdings.

Dividend Payment in Connection with Legal Settlement  
    
  On   January 4, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA paid a cash dividend of   $2.25   per share to holders of record of its Series A preferred stock at the close of business on   December 15, 2015   using cash on hand.  This dividend payment reduced the accumulated and unpaid dividends owed on the Series A preferred stock by   $21.9 million  .  The dividend was declared on   December 4, 2015   by the board of directors in connection with the settlement on a class-wide basis of the litigation brought in Maryland State Court and styled as   In re MPG Office Trust Inc. Preferred Shareholder Litigation  , Case No. 24-C-13-004097.  See Part II, Item 1.  Legal Proceedings Merger Related Litigation  for additional information regarding the dividend payment.

    This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus   1.75%  .  As required by the loan agreement, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge this loan, which effectively fixes the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at   2.178%  .  The effective interest rate of   3.93%   includes interest on the swap.

In connection with the refinancing, Brookfield DTLA Holdings repaid   $8.0 million   of principal and was required to fund various loan reserves, including a   $20.7 million   tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve, a   $4.5 million   rent concession reserve, and a   $3.0 million   tax reserve at closing.  During July 2016, the Company received   $37.0 million   in cash contributions from Brookfield DTLA Holdings, of which   $19.7 million   was used to pay for costs associated with the refinancing of Gas Company Tower.  
    
  The new   $450.0 million   mortgage loan is comprised of a   $319.0 million   senior loan and a   $131.0 million   mezzanine loan, which bear interest at fixed rates equal to   3.4727%   and   6.50%  , respectively, mature on   August 6, 2021  , and require the payment of interest-only until maturity.  The senior loan is locked out from prepayment until   September 6, 2017  , after which it can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment penalties (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until   April 6, 2021   after which the loan can be repaid without penalty.  The mezzanine loan is locked out from prepayment until   September 6, 2017  , after which the loan can be repaid, in whole or in part, without penalty.   
    
  Debt Modification 
    
  On   September 1, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA Holdings modified the mortgage loan secured by 777 Tower, which increased the loan amount from   $200.0 million   to   $220.0 million  .  As a result of the modification, the Company received net proceeds of   $19.7 million  , which will be used for general corporate purposes.

This loan will most likely require a paydown upon extension or refinancing (depending on market conditions), funding of additional reserve amounts, or both.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Brookfield DTLA anticipates the need for additional cash of approximately   $51 million   to complete the refinancing.  We may use cash on hand to make any such payments or cash received as a capital contribution from Brookfield DTLA Holdings.  If we are unable or unwilling to use cash on hand or do not use cash contributed by Brookfield DTLA Holdings to make such payments, we may face challenges in repaying, extending or refinancing this loan on favorable terms or at all, and we may be forced to give back the asset to the lenders.  There can be no assurance that this refinancing can be accomplished or what terms will be available in the market for this type of financing at the time of any refinancing. 
    
  Wells Fargo Center North Tower

  Non-Recourse Carve Out Guarantees 
    
  All of Brookfield DTLA s   $2.1 billion   of mortgage debt is subject to  non-recourse carve out  guarantees that expire upon elimination of the underlying loan obligations.  Under these guarantees, these otherwise non recourse loans can become partially or fully recourse against Brookfield DTLA Holdings if certain triggering events occur as defined in the loan agreements.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Cash Flow  
    
  Brookfield DTLA s business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs.  The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover Brookfield DTLA s operating, financing and investing activities, resulting in  negative cash burn,  and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA s negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future.  If Brookfield DTLA s operating cash flow and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock.  In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.  See  Liquidity and Capital Resources Potential Uses of Liquidity Property Operations  above. 
    
  The following summary discussion of Brookfield DTLA s cash flow is based on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 1.  Financial Statements  and is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the changes in its cash flow for the periods presented below.   

Operating Activities 
    
  Brookfield DTLA s cash flow from operating activities is primarily dependent upon (1) the occupancy level of its portfolio, (2) the rental rates achieved on its leases, and (3) the collectability of rent and other amounts billed to tenants and is also tied to the level of operating expenses.  Net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $29.2 million  , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $32.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $3.6 million   decrease is primarily related to changes in other working capital amounts. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Brookfield DTLA s cash flow from investing activities is generally impacted by the amount of capital expenditures for its properties.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled   $47.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $48.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of a reduction of restricted cash, which was partially offset by cash received from the sale of land held for investment during 2015 for which there was no comparable activity during 2016.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Financing Activities 
    
  Brookfield DTLA s cash flow from financing activities is generally impacted by our loan activity, less any dividends and distributions paid to stockholders and distributions to affiliated companies, if any.  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $29.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , comprised primarily of cash received from the issuance of the Series B preferred interest, a contribution from Brookfield DTLA Holdings and proceeds from the modification of the 777 Tower mortgage loan, which was partially offset by the payment of dividends on the Series A preferred stock and payments made in connection with the refinancing of the Gas Company Tower mortgage loan.   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  Brookfield DTLA did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table provides information with respect to Brookfield DTLA s commitments as of   September 30, 2016  , including any guaranteed or minimum commitments under contractual obligations (in thousands):

Critical Accounting Policies  
    
  Please refer to Brookfield DTLA s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 28, 2016   for a discussion of our critical accounting policies for  Business Combinations,   Consolidation,   Impairment Evaluation,   Revenue Recognition,  and  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.   There have been no changes to these policies during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09 establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    ASU 2014-09 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.    This topic provides guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and requires related footnote disclosures.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   to     ASC Topic 810  , Consolidation  .  ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain entities.  The guidance in ASU 2015-02 became effective for Brookfield DTLA beginning January 1, 2016.  The implementation of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to being presented as assets.  Brookfield DTLA elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 effective as of December 31, 2015.  There was no effect on our consolidated statements of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of adopting this pronouncement.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   to ASC Topic 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  .  ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on Brookfield DTLA s consolidated financial statements.

  See Part II, Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in Brookfield DTLA s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 28, 2016   for a discussion regarding our exposure to market risk.  Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since year end   2015  . 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 
       
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  Brookfield DTLA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
    
  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), Brookfield DTLA carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Brookfield DTLA s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, Paul L. Schulman, our principal executive officer, and Edward F. Beisner, our principal financial officer, concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in Brookfield DTLA s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or that are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    Legal Proceedings. 
       
  General 
    
  Brookfield DTLA and its subsidiaries may be subject to pending legal proceedings and litigation incidental to its business.  After consultation with legal counsel, management believes that any liability that may potentially result upon resolution of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or consolidated financial statements as a whole. 
    
  Merger-Related Litigation 
    
  Following the announcement of the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended (the  Merger Agreement ),   seven   putative class actions were filed against Brookfield Office Properties Inc. ( BPO ), Brookfield DTLA, Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Inc., Brookfield DTLA Fund Properties (collectively, the  Brookfield Parties ), MPG Office Trust, Inc., MPG Office, L.P., and the members of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors.    Five   of these lawsuits were filed on behalf of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s common stockholders: (i)   two   lawsuits, captioned   Coyne v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al  ., No. BC507342 (the  Coyne Action ), and   Masih v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al.  , No. BC507962 (the  Masih Action ), were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in Los Angeles County (the  California State Court ) on April 29, 2013 and May 3, 2013, respectively; and (ii)   three   lawsuits, captioned   Kim v. MPG Office Trust, Inc. et al  ., No. 24 C-13-002600 (the  Kim Action ),   Perkins v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al.  , No. 24-C-13-002778 (the  Perkins Action ) and   Dell Osso v. MPG Office Trust, Inc., et al.,   No. 24 C-13-003283 (the  Dell Osso Action ) were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland on May 1, 2013, May 8, 2013 and May 22, 2013, respectively (collectively, the  Common Stock Actions ).    Two   lawsuits, captioned   Cohen v. MPG Office Trust, Inc. et al.  , No. 24-C-13-004097 (the  Cohen Action ) and   Donlan v. Weinstein, et al  ., No. 24 C-13-004293 (the  Donlan Action ), were filed on behalf of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s preferred stockholders in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland on June 20, 2013 and July 2, 2013, respectively (collectively, the  Preferred Stock Actions ). 
    
  In each of the Common Stock Actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger by failing to maximize the value of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and ignoring or failing to protect against conflicts of interest, and that the relevant Brookfield Parties named as defendants aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty.  The Kim Action further alleges that MPG Office, L.P. also aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors, and the Dell Osso Action further alleges that MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors.  On June 4, 2013, the Kim and Perkins plaintiffs filed identical, amended complaints in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland.  On June 5, 2013, the Masih plaintiffs also filed an amended complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California in Los Angeles County.  The   three   amended complaints, as well as the Dell Osso Action complaint, allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by MPG Office Trust, Inc. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on May 21, 2013 is false and/or misleading because it fails to include certain details of the process leading up to the merger and fails to provide adequate information concerning MPG Office Trust, Inc. s financial advisors.

     Table of Contents  

In each of the Preferred Stock Actions, which were brought on behalf of MPG Office Trust, Inc. s preferred stockholders, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that, by entering into the Merger Agreement and tender offer, MPG Office Trust, Inc. breached the Articles Supplementary, which governs the issuance of the MPG preferred shares, that MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to a merger agreement that violated the preferred stockholders  contractual rights and that the relevant Brookfield Parties named as defendants aided and abetted those breaches of contract and fiduciary duty.  On July 15, 2013, the plaintiffs in the Preferred Stock Actions filed a joint amended complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland that further alleged that MPG Office Trust, Inc. s board of directors failed to disclose material information regarding BPO s extension of the tender offer.  
    
  The plaintiffs in the   seven   lawsuits sought an injunction against the merger, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the merger was consummated, an award of fees and costs, including attorneys  and experts  fees, and other relief. 
    
  On July 10, 2013, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, the Brookfield Parties and the other named defendants in the Common Stock Actions signed a memorandum of understanding, regarding a proposed settlement of all claims asserted therein.  The parties subsequently entered into a stipulation of settlement dated November 21, 2013 providing for the release of all asserted claims, additional disclosures by MPG concerning the merger made prior to the merger s approval, and the payment, by the defendants, of an award of attorneys  fees and expenses in an amount not to exceed   $475,000  .  After a hearing on June 4, 2014, the California State Court granted plaintiffs  motion for final approval of the settlement, and entered a Final Order and Judgment, awarding the plaintiffs  counsel s attorneys  fees and expenses in the amount of   $475,000  , which was paid by MPG Office LLC on June 18, 2014.   
    
  On   July 13, 2016  , BPO and the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the insurance carrier under the MPG directors and officers liability insurance policy that was in effect at the time of the merger.  On   August 17, 2016  , the Company received a settlement totaling   $1,106,344  , which partially reimbursed the Company for amounts paid to settle both the Common Stock Actions and the Preferred Stock Actions.  The Company included the settlement in interest and other revenue in its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  In the Preferred Stock Actions, at a hearing on July 24, 2013, the Maryland State Court denied the plaintiffs  motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the tender offer.  The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on November 22, 2013 that added additional arguments in support of their allegations that the new preferred shares do not have the same rights as the MPG preferred shares.  The defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on December 20, 2013, and briefing on the motion concluded on February 28, 2014.  At a hearing on June 18, 2014, the Maryland State Court heard oral arguments on the defendants  motion to dismiss and reserved judgment on the decision.  On October 21, 2014, the parties sent a joint letter to the Maryland State Court stating that since the June 18 meeting, the parties have commenced discussions towards a possible resolution of the lawsuit, requesting that the court temporarily refrain from deciding the pending motion to dismiss to facilitate the discussions.

On March 30, 2015, the plaintiff in the Cohen Action and the defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding setting forth an agreement in principle to settle the Preferred Stock Actions on a class-wide basis and dismiss the case with prejudice in exchange for the payment of   $2.25   per share of Series A preferred stock of accumulated and unpaid dividends (the  Dividend Payment ) to holders of record on a record date to be set after final approval of the settlement by the Maryland State Court, plus any attorneys  fees awarded by the Maryland State Court to the plaintiff s counsel.  The dividend will reduce the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A preferred stock, and the terms of the Series A preferred stock will otherwise remain unchanged.   
    
  On August 18, 2015, the Maryland State Court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and scheduling a final fairness hearing for October 27, 2015.  On September 28, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for final certification of the settlement class, final approval of the class action settlement and approval of attorneys  fees and reimbursement of expenses, seeking a total fee and expense award of   $5,250,000  .  The defendants submitted their opposition to the plaintiff s fee application on October 13, 2015. 
    
  On October 16, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking discovery related to the valuation of the Dividend Payment in connection with its fee application and served related discovery requests on the defendants.  On October 23, 2015, the defendants filed their opposition to that motion, as well as a motion for a protective order precluding discovery.  On October 27, 2015, the Maryland State Court held a hearing to decide whether to grant final approval of the settlement and to rule on the parties  discovery motions.  At the hearing, the Court ordered limited discovery to occur prior to ruling on the fee application.  
    
  On October 28, 2015, the Maryland State Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement.  The time to appeal the order expired on November 30, 2015 without any appeals having been filed.

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors. 
       
  Factors That May Affect Future Results  
  (Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)  
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of  safe harbor  provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (as set forth in Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )).  Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, include statements regarding our operations, business, financial condition, expected financial results, performance, prospects, opportunities, priorities, targets, goals, ongoing objectives, strategies and outlook, as well as the outlook for North American and international economies for the current fiscal year and subsequent periods, and include words such as  expects,   anticipates,   plans,   believes,   estimates,   seeks,   intends,   targets,   projects,   forecasts,   likely,  or negative versions thereof and other similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as  may,   will,   should,   would,  and  could.  
    
  Although Brookfield DTLA believes that its anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and information are based upon reasonable assumptions and expectations, the reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and information because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond its control, which may cause Brookfield DTLA s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and information. 
    
  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

Risks generally incident to the ownership of real property, including the ability to retain tenants and rent space upon lease expirations, the financial condition and solvency of our tenants, the relative illiquidity of real estate and changes in real estate taxes, regulatory compliance costs and other operating expenses; 

Risks associated with the Downtown Los Angeles market, which is characterized by challenging leasing conditions, including limited numbers of new tenants coming into the market and the downsizing of large tenants in the market such as accounting firms, banks and law firms; 

Risks related to increased competition for tenants in the Downtown Los Angeles market, including aggressive attempts by competing landlords to fill large vacancies by providing tenants with lower rental rates, increasing amounts of free rent and providing larger allowances for tenant improvements; 

The impact or unanticipated impact of general economic, political and market factors in the regions in which Brookfield DTLA or any of its subsidiaries does business; 

The use of debt to finance Brookfield DTLA s business or that of its subsidiaries; 

53 

     Table of Contents  

The behavior of financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates; 

Uncertainties of real estate development or redevelopment; 

Global equity and capital markets and the availability of equity and debt financing and refinancing within these markets; 

Risks relating to Brookfield DTLA s insurance coverage; 

The possible impact of international conflicts and other developments, including terrorist acts; 

Potential environmental liabilities; 

Dependence on management personnel; 

The ability to complete and effectively integrate acquisitions into existing operations and the ability to attain expected benefits therefrom; 

Operational and reputational risks; 

Catastrophic events, such as earthquakes and hurricanes; and 

Other risks and factors relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including, but not limited to: 

Increases in operating costs resulting from expenses related to the MPG acquisition; 

Failure to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including as a result of an increase in costs associated with integration or difficulty in integrating the businesses of Brookfield DTLA, BOA Plaza and EY Plaza and their respective subsidiaries, and MPG; 

Risks resulting from any lawsuits that may arise out of or have arisen as a result of the MPG acquisition or other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and 

The impact of legislative, regulatory and competitive changes and other risk factors relating to the real estate industry, as detailed from time to time in the reports of Brookfield DTLA and BPO filed with the SEC. 
       
  Brookfield DTLA cautions that the foregoing list of important factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive.  When relying on Brookfield DTLA s forward-looking statements or information, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events.  Except as required by law, Brookfield DTLA undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether written or oral, that may be as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Additional material risk factors are discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 28, 2016  .  Those risks are also relevant to our performance and financial condition.  Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
