SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Unless the context requires otherwise, references to  Innophos,   the Company,   we,   us  or  our  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Innophos Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the words  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   might,   objective,   ongoing,   plan,   predict,   project,   potential,   should,   will,  or  would,  and/or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  
  Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our expectations of the future, about which we cannot be certain. 
  The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include, among other things, statements about our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, the demand for our products and services, the markets in which we compete and other information that is not historical information 
  You should refer to  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2016, for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.  As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
  Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame or at all. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
  You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any documents that we reference in this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

1. Basis of Statement Presentation 
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Innophos have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) for interim financial reporting and do not include all disclosures required by US GAAP for annual financial reporting, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated and combined financial statements of the Company at December 31, 2015 and for the three years then ended. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim periods and is subject to year-end adjustments. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The December 31, 2015 condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by US GAAP. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  Adopted 
  In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued guidance which requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In January 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules which remove the concept of extraordinary items from US GAAP. Under the existing guidance, an entity is required to separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is of an unusual nature and occurs infrequently. This separate, net-of-tax presentation (and corresponding earnings per share impact) will no longer be allowed. The new rules will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the criteria for determining which entities are considered variable interest entities (VIEs) and to the criteria for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the deferral granted to investment companies for application of the VIE consolidation model. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures, although it did change the financial statement classification of our debt issuance costs. 
  Issued but not yet adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual

periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 (early adoption is permitted to the interim periods within the year of adoption). In July 2015 the FASB deferred the effective date by one year. The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance which establishes management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles in US auditing standards. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016; early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires entities to measure most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable value ( NRV ),  thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under the new guidance, inventory is  measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value,  which eliminates the need to determine replacement cost and evaluate whether it is above the ceiling (NRV) or below the floor (NRV less a normal profit margin). The guidance defines NRV as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. We do not anticipate the adoption of the new accounting rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated.  Measurement period adjustments are calculated as if they were known at the acquisition date, but are recognized in the reporting period in which they are determined.  Additional disclosures are required about the impact on current-period income statement line items of adjustments that would have been recognized in prior periods if prior-period information had been revised. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is to be applied prospectively to adjustments of provisional amounts that occur after the effective date.  Early application is permitted. We do not anticipate the new accounting rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Clarification on Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments on the Statement of Cash Flows. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of contingent consideration arising from a business combination, insurance settlement proceeds, and distributions from certain equity method investees. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

2. Earnings per Share (EPS) 
  The Company accounts for earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, which requires two calculations of earnings per share (EPS) to be disclosed: basic EPS and diluted EPS. Under ASC Subtopic 260-10-45, as of January 1, 2009 unvested awards of share-based payments with rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our restricted stock, are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating EPS. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and therefore is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. 
  The numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings attributable to shareholders reduced by dividends attributable to unvested shares. The denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. The denominator for diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock awards. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the weighted average basic number of common shares outstanding to the diluted number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding and the calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method:

3. Dividends 
  The following is the dividend activity for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  :    

Innophos Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, it is dependent upon cash dividends, distributions and other transfers from its subsidiaries, most directly Innophos, Inc., its primary operating subsidiary, and Innophos Investments Holdings, Inc., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Innophos Holdings, Inc. and the parent of Innophos, Inc., to make dividend payments on its common stock. 

4. Stockholders  Equity / Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Restricted Stock 
  In April 2016 there were a total of   88,590   restricted shares granted to certain employees with a fair value of   $2.8 million  . These awards are classified as equity awards and vest annually over a weighted average of   2.9 years  . The related compensation expense is based on the date of grant share price of   $31.44  . The compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period and accelerated for those employees that are retirement eligible during the vesting period. 
  Stock Options 
  In April 2016 the Company made grants of   400,216   non-qualified stock options at a weighted average exercise price of   $31.18   per share to certain employees with a fair value of   $1.8 million  . The non-qualified stock options vest annually over three years and expire in ten years. 
  The fair value of the options granted in 2016 were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows for the April 1, 2016 and April 13, 2016 grants, respectively: 
    
                   Non-qualified stock options 
      
      Expected volatility 
    33.8 
    % 
      Dividend yield 
    6.6 
    % 
      Risk-free interest rate 
    1.42 
    % 
      Expected term (years) 
    6.6 
      
      Weighted average grant date fair value of stock options 
    4.62 

For the 2016 grants the expected volatility and the expected term are based on the Company's historical data. The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend payments divided by the average stock price since announcement of the latest dividend change up to the date of grant. The risk-free interest rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury securities in effect on the date of grant whose maturity period equals the options expected term. The Company applies an expected forfeiture rate to stock-based compensation expense. The estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover. As actual forfeitures become known, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.

Stock Grants 
  In May 2016 the   seven   non-employee members of the Board of Directors were granted a combined total of   16,457   shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregated fair value of approximately   $0.6 million   which immediately vested as part of their director fees. 
  The following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation expense, all of which has been classified as selling, general and administrative expense: 

(a) The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include a charge of   $269   and a net benefit of   $255   due to restructuring activities. 

5. Inventories 
  Inventories consist of the following: 

Inventory reserves for excess quantities, obsolescence or shelf-life expiration as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $13,571   and   $16,946  , respectively. The Company decreased its net realizable value reserve for GTSP by   $536   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

9. Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt, and Interest Expense 
  Short-term borrowings and long-term debt consist of the following: 

The Company's credit facility includes a term loan of   $100.0 million   and a revolving line of credit from the lenders of up to   $225.0 million  , including a   $20.0 million   letter of credit sub-facility, all maturing on December 21, 2017. Repayments of the term loan are required at the rate of   1%   of original principal amount per quarter beginning on March 31, 2013. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $85.0 million   was outstanding under the term loan and   $115.0 million   was outstanding under the revolving line of credit, both of which approximate fair value because they have a floating interest rate (determined using level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy) with total availability at   $109.0 million  , taking into account   $1.0 million   in face amount of letters of credit issued under the sub-facility. The current weighted average interest rate for all debt is   2.8%  . 
  Among its affirmative covenants, the credit agreement governing this credit facility requires the Company to maintain the following consolidated ratios (as defined and calculated according to the credit agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter: 
  (a)  Total Leverage Ratio  less than or equal to   3.00   to   1.00  . 
  (b)  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  greater than or equal to   1.25   to   1.00  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in full compliance with all debt covenant requirements. 
  Simultaneous with the term of the credit facility, Innophos entered into an interest rate swap, swapping the LIBOR exposure on   $100.0 million   adjusting monthly, with a fixed rate of   0.9475%   plus the applicable margin on the debt expiring in December 2017. This interest rate swap has been designated as a cashflow hedge (Level 2) with the changes in value recorded through other comprehensive income. The fair value of this interest rate swap of approximately   $0.3 million   is recorded in other long-term liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on   $100.0 million   outstanding borrowings as floating rate debt (amount not covered by the swap), an immediate increase of one percentage point would cause an increase to interest expense of approximately   $1.0 million   per year. 
  We manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt to the extent practicable consistent with our credit status. 
  Total interest paid by the Company for all indebtedness for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was   $5,298   and   $4,089  , respectively.

Interest expense, net consists of the following: 

10. Other Long-Term Liabilities 
  Other long-term liabilities consist of the following: 

11. Income Taxes 
  The effective income tax rate on income before taxes was approximately   32%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately   32%   for the comparable period in 2015. The change in the components of the effective tax rate are primarily due to a permanent adjustment attributable to an inventory obsolescence reserve in Mexico which increased the effective tax rate by   1%   in the current year, which was offset by foreign tax benefits, mainly in Mexico related to de-consolidation of our Mexican subsidiaries for income tax reporting purposes, which decreased the effective tax rate by   1%  . 
  Business is conducted in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. A significant number of tax returns are filed and subject to examination by various federal, state and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex, as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported requiring several years to resolve. As such, the Company maintains liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures for uncertain income tax positions. The Company s policy is to accrue associated penalties in selling, general and administrative expenses and to accrue interest in net interest expense. Currently, the Company is under examination, or has been contacted for examination on income tax returns, for the years 2007 through 2013. In addition, Innophos Canada, Inc. was assessed approximately   $4.0 million   for the tax years 2007 and 2008 by the Canadian tax authorities. The Company is contesting the full assessment. After lengthy discussions, the Canadian tax authorities have reassessed these amounts in August 2014 and the Company filed a Notice of Objection with the Canada Revenue Agency Appeals Board in November 2014. The Company filed a petition to Competent Authority who has agreed to accept our matter. The Company believes that its tax position is more likely than not to be sustained. Also, certain state income tax assessments are under protest and the Company believes its financial position is sustainable. The Company estimates the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately   $1.2 million   during the next twelve months as a result of possible settlements of income tax authority examinations. Other than the items mentioned above, as of   September 30, 2016  , no material adjustments have been proposed to the Company's tax positions and the Company currently does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position during the next   twelve   months.

Income taxes paid were   $34.8 million   and   $10.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

12. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Environmental 
  The Company's operations are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and international environmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company's manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial use, and soil and groundwater contamination have or may have occurred in the past and might occur or be discovered in the future. 
  Environmental efforts are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the discovery of new remedial sites, discovery of new information and scarcity of reliable information pertaining to certain sites, improvements in technology, changes in environmental laws, rules and regulations, numerous possible remedial techniques and solutions, difficulty in assessing the involvement of and the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the extended time periods over which remediation occurs. Other than the items listed below, the Company is not aware of material environmental liabilities which are probable and estimable. As the Company's environmental contingencies are more clearly determined, it is reasonably possible that amounts may need to be accrued. However, management does not believe, based on current information, that environmental remediation requirements will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  Future environmental spending is probable at our site in Nashville, TN, the eastern portion of which had been used historically as a landfill, and a western parcel therein, previously acquired from a third party, which reportedly had housed, but no longer does, a fertilizer and pesticide manufacturing facility. We have an estimated liability with a range of   $0.9 million  -  $1.3 million  . The remedial action plan for that site has yet to be finalized, and as such, the Company has recorded a liability, which represents the Company's best estimate, of   $1.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Purchase Commitments and Supplier Concentration 
  The Company s business depends on its ability to source raw materials used in its products. Most of the Company s raw materials are supplied to it by either one or a small number of suppliers. Some of those suppliers rely, in turn, on sole or limited sources of supply for raw materials included in their products. The Company s raw materials are purchased under supply contracts that vary from long term multi-year supply arrangements to annual agreements. The Company also relies on spot suppliers. In any given year, one or more of these contracts may come up for renewal. As such, on June 23, 2016, the Company received written notice from PCS Purified Phosphates, or PCSPP, an affiliate of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, or PCS, that PCSPP does not wish to extend the term of the Amended and Restated Purified Wet Phosphoric Acid Supply Agreement, dated March 23, 2000, beyond July 29, 2018, the end of the current renewal term. The Company currently purchases purified phosphoric acid supply from PCSPP under the agreement and it will continue to qualify and develop additional sources for future supply needs after July 29, 2018. 
  Litigation 
  2008 RCRA Civil Enforcement - Geismar, Louisiana plant 
  Following several inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, at our Geismar, Louisiana purified phosphoric acid, or PPA, plant and related submissions we made to support claimed exemptions from the federal Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, in March 2008, EPA referred our case to the Department of Justice, or DOJ, for civil enforcement. Although no citations were ever issued or formal proceedings instituted, the agencies claim we violate RCRA by failing to manage appropriately two materials that DOJ/EPA alleges are hazardous wastes. Those materials are: (i) Filter Material from an enclosed intermediate filtration step to further process green phosphoric acid we receive as raw material via pipeline from the adjacent site operated by an affiliate of PCS; and (ii) Raffinate, a co-product we return to PCS under a long-term contract we have with PCS. 
  Since referral of the case to DOJ, we and PCS have engaged in periodic discussions with DOJ/EPA and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, or LDEQ, or collectively the Government Parties, in order to resolve the matter. In addition to asserting that the two materials in question are not hazardous wastes, we have also sought to demonstrate that both the nature and character of the materials as well as their use, handling and disposition were detailed in a solid waste permit amendment application filed in 1989 by PCS's predecessor, when our plant was first constructed, and approved by the LDEQ under the state RCRA program.

  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts, share amounts or where otherwise noted)  

In the course of discussions with the Government Parties, the DOJ/EPA has required that we undertake, as an interim measure, the construction of a new filter unit to replace the enclosed system and allow the removal and separate handling of the Filter Material. We built that unit, which has been operating since 2012. 
  In an attempt to address the remaining concerns of the Government Parties, we and PCS undertook joint efforts to explore possible technical solutions to the issue of Raffinate treatment. Based upon work so far, there appears to be at least one technically viable approach, namely that of  deep well injection,  which we believe is acceptable to regulators as part of a negotiated solution among the parties.  
  Although we cannot give assurances as to the future course or ultimate outcome of ongoing negotiations, including whether litigation may ultimately ensue, we believe, based on our appreciation of the current state of the proceedings, that deep well injection is likely to be employed as the technologically acceptable approach for Raffinate. PCS has applied to the relevant government agencies for a deep well permit. We have also applied for our own deep well permit for future business reasons. In negotiated settlements leading to consent decrees with the Governmental Parties, it is also common for penalties relating to previous  non-compliance  to be assessed and, in that connection, we have been advised by the Governmental Parties that they expect to seek penalties against both PCS and us in this case. Although we have argued and made submissions to the effect that for purposes of settlement penalties there is no basis for any substantial penalty to be levied against us, nevertheless, we can give no assurance as to that outcome, or if a penalty is initially assessed as to its amount, or whether it will be necessary for us to oppose or seek indemnity for the assessment by further litigation. Based upon our receipt of a draft consent decree from the Government Parties in June 2014 and subsequent discussions with them, the Company now confirms an assessment of and has increased its estimated liability to   $1.4 million   for this penalty from its original assessment of   $0.9 million  . However, further discussions among all parties will be necessary to determine the civil penalties liability and if the matter can be resolved by settlement. 
  Other Legal Matters 
  In July 2013, Innophos, Inc. was assessed approximately   $1.2 million   of sales/use taxes by the State of Louisiana and Ascension Parish. This tax assessment covers certain raw materials used in the production of Phosphoric Acid. The Company is contesting both tax assessments. This assessment covers periods 2004 to 2010 for the Parish and 2007 to 2010 for the State. We have concluded that the contingent liability arising from this matter is neither remote nor probable, but reasonably possible. 
  In addition, we are party to legal proceedings and contractual disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Except as to the matters specifically discussed, management believes that these matters represent remote liabilities. However, these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

15. Restructuring Costs 
  During 2015 management evaluated several initiatives to improve the overall operating efficiency of the organization. As a result of this evaluation we launched an initiative to reduce our cost structure by implementing various staff reduction actions during the third quarter of 2015.  
  In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a management transition of certain high-level positions, most notably the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, additional amounts recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations in connection with continued restructuring were   $1,508   and   $1,844   (including accelerated stock compensation of   $269   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016), respectively, and cost of goods sold were   $0   and   $145  , respectively. These amounts were all included in the GTSP   Other segment. 
  The following table summarizes the fiscal year 2016 activities related to severance and benefits: 

(a) Accelerated stock-based compensation expense due to management transition. 
  The Company closed its Paterson, NJ location as of March 31, 2016 and consolidated a majority of the Paterson operations to its Green Pond, South Carolina location. In addition, as a result of further business restructuring, the sale of the Company's Ogden, Utah administration building was completed in July 2016. 

16. Segment Reporting 
  The company discloses certain financial and supplementary information about its reportable segments, revenue by products and revenues by geographic area. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, in order to decide how to allocate resources and assess performance. The primary performance indicators for the chief operating decision maker are sales and EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization), with sales presented on a ship-from basis. All references to sales in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, either on a ship-from or ship-to basis, are on the same basis of revenue recognition and are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which occurs either upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the agreed sales terms with customers. 
  The Company's reportable segments reflect the core businesses in which Innophos operates and how it is managed. The Company reports its core specialty phosphates business separately from granular triple super-phosphate, or GTSP, and other non-specialty phosphate products (GTSP   Other). Specialty Phosphates consists of three products lines: Specialty Ingredients; Food   Technical Grade PPA; and STPP   Detergent Grade PPA. Innophos Nutrition, Inc. is included in the Specialty

Phosphates US   Canada segment and in the Specialty Ingredients product line. GTSP   Other includes fertilizer co-product GTSP and other non-specialty phosphate products. 
  Prior to 2016, the primary performance indicators for the chief operating decision maker were sales and operating income. As of January 1, 2016, the primary performance indicators for the chief operating decision maker as of 2016 are sales and EBITDA and all prior periods have been recasted to reflect the change from operating income to EBITDA. The Company's chief operating decision maker, its new Chief Executive Officer as of December 14, 2015, decided that EBITDA is the measure for assessing the performance of the Company's segments.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     Innophos is a leading international producer of performance-critical and nutritional specialty ingredients, with applications in food, beverage, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical, oral care and industrial end markets. Innophos combines more than a century of experience in specialty phosphate manufacturing with a growing capability in a broad range of other specialty ingredients to supply a product range produced to stringent regulatory manufacturing standards and the quality demanded by customers worldwide. Many of Innophos' products are application-specific compounds engineered to meet customer performance requirements and are often critical to the taste, texture and performance of foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, oral care products and other applications. For example, Innophos products act as flavor enhancers in beverages, electrolytes in sports drinks, texture additives in cheeses, leavening agents in baked goods, pharmaceutical excipients, cleaning agents in toothpaste and provide a wide range of nutritional fortification solutions for food, beverage and nutritional supplement manufacturers. 

Recent Trends and Outlook 
       
  Specialty Phosphates volumes are expected to decline by 6-8% for full year 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to reduced sales in lower margin, less differentiated applications and weak end market demand due to continued pressures on packaged foods. 
  Market phosphate rock and sulfur prices declined modestly for the third quarter 2016. Raw material costs are expected to continue at current levels in the fourth quarter.  
  Cost improvements from the restructuring program implemented in the third quarter 2015 were in line with expectations, with $3 million lower costs realized in the current quarter against the third-quarter 2015 baseline. Additional year-on-year cost savings were delivered due to detailed cost management. Management continues to review cost actions and productivity initiatives given the challenging market conditions.  
  Net income and EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the fourth quarter are expected to be somewhat softer compared with first and second quarter 2016 when considering the following net effects.  
     Seasonably weaker Q4 revenues along with continued headwinds in sales 
     Strength of US Dollar continuing to attract competition from overseas and to pressure exports from the US 
     Raw material costs at current levels and continued operational excellence cost savings

Historical Performance 
  Results of Operations 
  The following table sets forth a summary of the Company s operations and their percentages of total revenue for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales represent the selling price of the products, net of any customer-related rebates, plus freight and any other items invoiced to customers. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were   $186.0   million, a decrease of   $13.6   million, or   6.8%  , as compared to   $199.6   million for the same period in 2015. Specialty Phosphates sales were down 9.0%, or $16.8 million, with volumes lower by 8.5%, or $15.8 million, due to reduced sales in lower margin, less differentiated applications, and reduced demand across product lines in core markets served, and selling prices lower by 0.5%, or $1.0 million. The volume decrease was mostly recognized in the United States and Canada Specialty Phosphates segment. GTSP   Other sales were up 23.5%, or $3.2 million, with volumes higher by 50.4%, or $6.9 million, but prices lower by 26.9%, or $3.7 million, as market prices remained at the lowest levels seen in six years.  
  The Company calculates pure selling price dollar variances as the selling price for the current year to date period minus the selling price for the prior year to date period, and then multiplies the resulting selling price difference by the prior year to date period volume. Volume variance is calculated as the total sales variance minus the selling price variance and refers to the revenue effect of changes in tons sold at the relative prices applicable to the variation in tons, otherwise known as volume/mix.

Gross Profit 
  Gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   $40.5   million, an increase of   $3.4   million, or   9.2%  , as compared to   $37.1   million for the same period in 2015. Gross profit percentage of net sales increased to   21.8  % for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus   18.6  % for the same period in 2015. Gross profit in 2016 was favorably affected by $6.7 million lower raw material costs, largely phosphate rock and sulfur, $1.4 million favorable exchange rates from our Mexican peso and Canadian dollar based costs, and $1.3 million lower manufacturing costs due to savings from the 2015 restructuring program and focus on cost controls. These favorable effects were partially offset by $4.7 million lower selling prices, $3.1 million lower sales volume and $1.0 million higher depreciation. Included in 2015 gross profit was $2.8 million restructuring cost. 
  Operating Expenses and Research and Development 
  Operating expenses consist primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were   $18.6   million, a decrease of   $5.9   million, or   24.1  %, as compared to   $24.5   million for the same period in 2015. The decrease is due to $4.3 million lower restructuring costs and $2.6 million lower costs related to savings from the 2015 restructuring program and lower discretionary spending. These favorable effects were partially offset by $1.0 million higher short term incentive accruals.  
  Operating Income 
  Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   $21.9   million, an increase of   $9.3   million, or   73.8  %, as compared to   $12.6   million for the same period in 2015. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to   11.8  % versus   6.3  % for the same period in 2015, for the reasons noted above.  
  Interest Expense, net 
  Net interest expense, including deferred financing amortization expense, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   $1.9   million, unchanged from the   $1.9   recorded in the same period in 2015.  
  Foreign Exchange 
  Foreign exchange for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of   $0.1   million as compared to a loss of   $2.6   million for the same period in 2015. The US Dollar is the functional currency of our Mexican and Canadian operations. The Company has greater foreign denominated asset balances (largely Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar), such as VAT receivables and prepaid income taxes in foreign jurisdictions, than offsetting foreign denominated liability balances. As the US Dollar strengthened throughout the prior year period versus the Mexican Peso and the Canadian Dollar, the re-measurement of the net foreign asset denominated balances contributed to a net foreign exchange loss. Consequently, foreign exchange gain or loss is recorded on re-measurement of non-US Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Such gains and losses  
  
   Page    26   of 39 

Table of Contents  

fluctuate from period to period as the foreign currencies strengthen or weaken against the US Dollar and the amount of non-US Dollar denominated assets and liabilities increases or decreases. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective income tax rate was 31% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 33% for the same period in 2015. The variance in the effective tax rate is primarily due to higher taxable income in low tax rate jurisdictions which decreased the effective tax rate by 2% in the current period.  
  Net Income 
  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   $13.6   million, an increase of   $8.2   million, as compared to   $5.4   million for the same period in 2015, due to the factors described above. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales represent the selling price of the products, net of any customer-related rebates, plus freight and any other items invoiced to customers. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $557.5   million, a decrease of   $61.0   million, or   9.9%  , as compared to   $618.5   million for the same period in 2015. Specialty Phosphates sales were down 8.9%, or $50.3 million, with volumes lower by 8.0%, or $44.9 million, and selling prices lower by 0.9%, or $5.4 million. The volume decrease was mostly recognized in the United States and Canada Specialty Phosphates segment due to reduced sales in lower margin, less differentiated applications, and reduced demand across product lines in core markets served. GTSP   Other sales were down 21.0%, or $10.7 million, with volumes lower by 1.2%, or $0.6 million, and prices lower by 19.8%, or $10.1 million, due to weak fertilizer market conditions.  
  The Company calculates pure selling price dollar variances as the selling price for the current year to date period minus the selling price for the prior year to date period, and then multiplies the resulting selling price difference by the prior year to date period volume. Volume variance is calculated as the total sales variance minus the selling price variance and refers to the revenue effect of changes in tons sold at the relative prices applicable to the variation in tons, otherwise known as volume/mix. 
   The following table illustrates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the percentage changes in net sales by reportable segment compared with the same period of the prior year, including the effect of price and volume/mix changes upon revenue:

Gross Profit 
  Gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $117.4   million, a decrease of   $1.2   million, or   1.0%  , as compared to   $118.6   million for the same period in 2015. Gross profit percentage of net sales increased to   21.1  % for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus   19.2  % for the same period in 2015. Gross profit in 2016 was unfavorably affected by $15.5 million lower selling prices and $14.5 million lower sales

volume. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by $13.9 million lower raw material costs, largely phosphate rock and sulfur, $6.8 million lower manufacturing costs due to savings from the 2015 restructuring program and focus on cost controls, $4.1 million favorable exchange effects from our Mexican peso and Canadian dollar based costs, and $1.2 million lower depreciation. Included in 2015 gross profit was $2.8 million restructuring cost. 
  Operating Expenses and Research and Development 
  Operating expenses consist primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $54.6   million, a decrease of   $8.8   million, or   13.9%  , as compared to   $63.4   million for the same period in 2015. The decrease is due to $7.2 million lower costs related to savings from the 2015 restructuring program, $4.3 million lower restructuring costs and $0.7 million favorable exchange effects from our Mexican peso based costs. These favorable effects were partially offset by $1.9 million of strategy consulting fees and first quarter 2016 CEO transition costs, and $1.5 million higher short term incentive accruals.

  Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $62.8   million, an increase of   $7.6   million, or   13.8%  , as compared to   $55.2   million for the same period in 2015. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to   11.3  % versus   8.9  % for the same period in 2015, for the reasons noted above.  
  Interest Expense, net 
  Net interest expense, including deferred financing amortization expense, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $5.6   million, an increase of   $1.2   million, or   27.3%  , as compared to   $4.4   million for the same period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to higher average loan balances and interest rates.  
  Foreign Exchange 
  Foreign exchange for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of   $0.5   million as compared to a loss of   $5.1   million for the same period in 2015. The US Dollar is the functional currency of our Mexican and Canadian operations. The Company has greater foreign denominated asset balances (largely Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar), such as VAT receivables and prepaid income taxes in foreign jurisdictions, than offsetting foreign denominated liability balances. As the US Dollar strengthened throughout the prior year period versus the Mexican Peso and the Canadian Dollar, the re-measurement of the net foreign asset denominated balances contributed to a net foreign exchange loss. Consequently, foreign exchange gain or loss is recorded on re-measurement of non-US Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Such gains and losses fluctuate from period to period as the foreign currencies strengthen or weaken against the US Dollar and the amount of non-US Dollar denominated assets and liabilities increases or decreases. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective income tax rate was 32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 32% for the same period in 2015. A permanent adjustment attributable to an inventory obsolescence reserve in Mexico which increased the effective tax rate by   1%   in the current year was offset by foreign tax benefits, mainly in Mexico related to de-consolidation of our Mexican subsidiaries for income tax reporting purposes, which decreased the effective tax rate by   1%  .  
  Net Income 
  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $38.6   million, an increase of   $7.6   million, as compared to   $31.0   million for the same period in 2015, due to the factors described above.

A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA follows: 

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Segment Net Sales: 
  Specialty Phosphates US   Canada net sales decreased   12.2%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Average selling prices decreased by   0.7%   and volumes decreased   11.5%   due to reduced sales of lower margin, less differentiated applications, and reduced demand across product lines in core markets served.  
  Specialty Phosphates Mexico net sales increased   2.5%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 due to higher STPP and Detergent Grade PPA sales. Average selling prices increased   0.2%   and volumes increased   2.3%  .  
  GTSP   Other net sales increased   23.5%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Volumes increased   50.4%   while average selling prices decreased   26.9%   due to the lowest market price levels seen in six years.  
  Segment EBITDA Percentage of Net Sales: 
  The 240 basis point decrease in Specialty Phosphates US   Canada EBITDA margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 is due to lower sales volume/mix which decreased margins by 490 basis points and lower selling prices which decreased margins by 60 basis points, partially offset by lower manufacturing and operating expenses which increased margins by 180 basis points, lower raw material costs, largely PPA, which increased margins by 80 basis points, and favorable translation effects which increased margins by 50 basis points.  
  The 2,650 basis point increase in Specialty Phosphates Mexico EBITDA margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 is due to lower raw material costs, phosphate rock and sulfur, which increased margins by 2,290 basis points, favorable exchange rate and translation effects which increased margins by 610 basis points, and increased sales volume/mix which increased margins by 90 basis points. This increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses which decreased margins by 340 basis points.  
  The 5,420 basis point increase in GTSP   Other EBITDA margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 is due to lower restructuring costs which increased margins by 5,200 basis points, increased sales volume/mix which increased margins by 2,130 basis points, lower raw material cost which increased margins by 1,860 basis points, lower manufacturing expenses which increased margins by 1,070 basis points, and favorable exchange rate and translation effects which increased margins by 770 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower selling prices which decreased margins by 5,610 basis points.

Nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Segment Net Sales: 
  Specialty Phosphates US   Canada net sales decreased   10.4%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Average selling prices decreased by   0.5%   and volumes decreased   9.9%   due to reduced sales of lower margin, less differentiated applications, and reduced demand across product lines in core markets served.  
  Specialty Phosphates Mexico net sales decreased   3.3%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Average selling prices decreased   2.4%  , primarily due to competitive pressures on PPA, and volumes decreased   0.9%  .  
  GTSP   Other net sales decreased   21.0%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Volumes decreased   1.2%   and average selling prices decreased   19.8%   due to weak fertilizer market conditions.  
  Segment EBITDA Percentage of Net Sales: 
  The 60 basis point decrease in Specialty Phosphates US   Canada EBITDA margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 is due to lower sales volume/mix which decreased margins by 150 basis points, higher raw material costs, largely merchant green acid, which decreased margins by 100 basis points, and lower selling prices which decreased margins by 50 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by lower manufacturing and operating expenses which increased margins by 190 basis points and favorable translation effects which increased margins by 50 basis points.  
  The 1,400 basis point increase in Specialty Phosphates Mexico EBITDA margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 is due to lower raw material costs, phosphate rock and sulfur, which increased margins by 1,040 basis points, favorable exchange rate and translation effects which increased margins by 430 basis points, and lower manufacturing and operating expenses which increased margins by 210 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower selling prices which decreased margins by 210 basis points and lower sales volume/mix which decreased margins by 70 basis points.  
  The 670 basis point increase in GTSP   Other EBITDA margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 is due to lower restructuring costs which increased margins by 1,390 basis points, lower raw material cost which increased margins by 970 basis points, higher sales volume/mix which increased margins by 740 basis points, and favorable exchange rate and translation effects which increased margins by 350 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower selling prices which decreased margins by 2,740 basis points and higher turnaround costs which decreased margins by 40 basis points.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table sets forth a summary of the Company s cash flows for the periods indicated. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 
  Net cash from operating activities was a source of   $81.8   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to source of   $75.9   million for 2015, an increase of $5.9 million. The increase in cash from operating activities resulted from favorable changes of   $7.6   million in net income, as described earlier, and $5.5 million in working capital, partially offset by unfavorable changes of $6.5 million in other long term assets and liabilities and $0.7 million in non-cash adjustments to income.  
  The favorable change in working capital was derived from it being a source of cash of $16.4 million in 2016 compared to a source in 2015 of $10.9 million, an increase in cash of $5.5 million. The favorable change in working capital was due to favorable changes in inventory of $18.0 million due to lower raw material costs and adjustments for lower customer demand, $10.0 million in accounts receivable due to lower sales levels, and accounts payable of $8.1 million due to large vendor payables at December 31, 2014, which were paid during the first quarter of 2015. These favorable changes in working capital were partially offset by unfavorable changes in other current liabilities of $21.5 million largely due to U.S. income tax payments of $18.6 million for immediate recognition of revenue for income tax purposes which is not expected to recur, and other current assets of $9.1 million because of high other current assets related to income and VAT taxes at December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable as a percent of quarterly sales, when adjusted for GTSP open accounts receivable of $0.2 million, $1.8 million, $1.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.9 million as of September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively, was consistent with the last four quarters' average. 
  Net cash used for investing activities was   $25.7   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to   $21.8   million for 2015, an increase in capital spending of $3.9 million. 
   Approximately 68% of the capital spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was for maintenance and the remaining 32% was for strategic growth initiatives. The majority of the strategic growth investments were focused on improving the production efficiency and packaging at our Nashville, Tennessee facility, continuous reliability improvement at our Coatzacoalcos, Mexico facility and investments to support the manufacturing restructuring. Our expectation for 2016 capital expenditures is in the range of $34 million to $36 million, which is below prior projections due to timing of certain projects that will fall into 2017. The capital expenditures are due to requirements to support strategic manufacturing initiatives and restructuring, along with continuous improvement in our plants.  
   Net cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a use of   $41.6   million, compared to a use of   $4.0   million in 2015, a decrease in cash of $37.6 million. This decrease in cash was largely due to $120.0 million decreased loan borrowings and $43.0 million increased loan repayments, partially offset by $125.1 million decreased stock repurchases. The loan borrowings in 2015 were largely used to fund the share repurchases. 
  Innophos and its subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time seek to acquire or otherwise retire outstanding debt through privately negotiated transactions, exchanges or otherwise. Debt repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, Company liquidity requirements, restrictive financial covenants and other factors applicable at the time. The amounts involved may be material.  
  Given the 2015 margin compression that the Company experienced, management evaluated several initiatives to improve the overall operating efficiency of the organization. As a result of this evaluation which was concluded during the third quarter of 2015, we launched an initiative to reduce our cost structure by implementing various staff reduction actions. During the nine

Table of Contents  

months ended September 30, 2016, the Company spent $6.2 million related to these activities, and anticipates to spend $5.9 million within the next twelve months. 
  On September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents outside the United States of $24.6 million, or 75% of the Company's balance. Furthermore, the foreign cash amounts are not restricted by law to be used in other countries. In the event we plan to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. 
  The Company s available financial resources allow for the continuation of dividend payments, pursuit of acquisition projects and further geographic expansion initiatives. We further believe that on-hand cash combined with cash generated from operations, including our Mexican and Canadian operations, and availability under our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our obligations such as debt service, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We expect to fund all of these obligations through our existing cash and our future operating cash flows. However, future operating performance for the Company is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and various other factors that are uncertain. If the cash flows and other capital resources available to the Company, such as its revolving loan facility, are insufficient to fund our debt and other liquidity needs, the Company may have to take alternative actions that differ from current operating plans. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
  Goodwill 
  The GTSP and Other reporting unit fair value currently exceeds the carrying value of the assets. 
  However, if GTSP market softness continues as we have experienced during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and if GTSP pricing does not return to historical levels, this reporting unit may incur a goodwill impairment charge in the future. The GTSP   Other reporting unit has an allocated goodwill value of $3.3 million. In addition, if we were to decrease the long-term growth rate by 1% or increase the discount rate used in the calculation by 1%, assuming all other variables constant, there would be a goodwill impairment for the GTSP   Other reporting unit. 
  Other than the above, there have been no material changes from the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations. Primary exposures include changes in interest rates, as borrowings under our credit agreement will bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable borrowing margin. We manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt to the extent practicable consistent with our credit status. For fixed-rate debt, interest rate changes do not affect earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate debt, interest rate changes generally affect our earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $85 million   principal amount of variable-rate debt remaining on a term loan and a $225.0 million revolving credit facility, of which   $115.0 million   of variable-rate debt was outstanding, both of which approximate fair value (determined using level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy). Total remaining availability was   $109 million  , taking into account   $1.0 million   in face amount of letters of credit issued under the sub-facility. Simultaneously with initiating the new senior facility, Innophos entered into an interest rate swap, swapping the LIBOR exposure on   $100.0 million   of floating rate debt with a fixed rate of   0.9475%   plus the applicable margin on the debt expiring in December 2017. This interest rate swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge with the changes in value recorded through other comprehensive income. The fair value of this interest rate swap of approximately   $0.3 million   (determined using level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy) is recorded in other long-term liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense on our revolving line of credit. Changes in economic conditions may also result in lower operating income, reducing our funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. In addition, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow and available borrowing capacity on our credit facility has been used to repurchase shares, pay dividends, fund capital expenditures, fund working capital needs and service debt, which may affect our ability to make future acquisitions. We have and may continue from time to time use interest rate protection agreements to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuation. Regardless of hedges, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations. Based on   $100.0 million   outstanding borrowings as floating rate debt (amount not covered by the swap), an immediate increase of one percentage point would cause an increase to interest expense of approximately   $1.0 million   per year. 
  From time to time, we may enter into longer term natural gas supply contracts in an effort to eliminate some of the volatility in our energy costs. We did not enter into any economic hedges in the past three years. 
  We do not currently, but may from time to time, hedge our currency rate risks. 
  We believe that our concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable is limited since these receivables are spread among a number of customers and are geographically dispersed. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales in the last 3 years. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
  The US Dollar is the functional currency of the Canadian and Mexican operations. Accordingly, these operations  monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at current exchange rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates and at historical exchange rates for the related revenue and expenses of non-monetary assets and liabilities. All transaction gains and losses are included in net income. 
  Our principal source of exchange rate exposure in our foreign operations consists of expenses, such as labor expenses, which are denominated in the foreign currency of the country in which we operate. A decline in the value of the US Dollar relative to the local currency would generally cause our operational expenses (particularly labor costs) to increase (conversely, a decline in the value of the foreign currency relative to the US Dollar would cause these expenses to decrease). We believe that normal exchange rate fluctuations consistent with recent historical trends would have a modest impact on our expenses, and would not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Nearly all of our sales are denominated in US Dollars and our exchange rate exposure in terms of sales revenues is minimal. However, the strength or weakness of the USD versus other currencies can affect our competitiveness in the US and export markets. 
  Inflation and changing prices 
  Our costs and expenses will be subject to inflation and price fluctuations. Significant price fluctuations in raw materials, freight and energy costs, if not compensated for by cost savings from production efficiencies or price increases passed on to customers, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as  structured finance or special purpose entities , which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Disclosure Control and Procedures 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements and filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during or with respect to the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
