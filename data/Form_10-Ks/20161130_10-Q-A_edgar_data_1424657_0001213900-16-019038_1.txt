1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS    

Next Group Holdings, Inc, (the  Company )
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on September 21, 2005 to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries,
both current and future. Its subsidiaries are Meimoun and Mammon, LLC (100% owned), Next Cala, Inc (94% owned). NxtGn, Inc. (65%
owned) and Next Mobile 360, Inc. (100% owned). Additionally, Next Cala, Inc. has a 60% interest in NextGlocal, a subsidiary
formed in May 2016. 

Meimoun
and Mammon, LLC ( M M ) was formed under the laws of the State of Florida on May 21, 2001 as a real estate investment
company. During the year ended December 31, 2010, M M began winding down real estate operations and engaged in telecommunications
services. M M acquired telecom registrations, licenses and authorities to provide telecom services to the retail and wholesale
markets including sales of prepaid long distance telecom services and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services. The services
are sold under the brand name Next Mobile 360 and through the subsidiary of the same name.  

Next
Cala, Inc, ( Cala ) was formed under the laws of Florida on July 10, 2009 to the purpose of offering prepaid and reloadable
debit cards to the retail market. Cala serves consumers in the underbanked and unbanked populations through Incomm, a leading
provider of payment remittance services worldwide.  

NxtGn,
Inc. ( NxtGn ) was formed under the laws of Florida on August 24, 2011 to develop a unique High Definition telepresence
product (AVYDA) which allows users to connect with celebrities, public figures, healthcare and education applications via a mobile
phone, tablet or personal computer.  

On
January 1, 2016, NGH completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Pleasant Kids, Inc. ( Pleasant
Kids ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, NGH Acquisition Corp. ( Acquisition Sub ), pursuant to which NGH merged
with Acquisition Sub and Acquisition Sub was then merged into PLKD effective January 1, 2016. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the NGH shareholders received shares of PLKD common stock such that the NGH shareholders received approximately 80% of the total
common shares and 100% of the preferred shares of PLKD issued and outstanding following the merger. Due to the nominal assets
and limited operations of PLKD prior to the merger, the transaction was accorded reverse recapitalization accounting treatment
under the provision of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC ) 805 whereby
NGH became the accounting acquirer (legal acquiree) and PLKD was treated as the accounting acquiree (legal acquirer). The historical
financial records of the Company are those of the accounting acquirer (NGH) adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the accounting
acquire (PLKD).     As the transaction was treated as a recapitalization, no intangibles, including goodwill, were
recognized. Concurrent with the effective date of the reverse recapitalization transaction, the Company adopted the fiscal year
end of the accounting acquirer of December 31.  

On
May 27, 2016, the Cala entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Glocal Payments Solutions, Inc
( Glocal ) to form a joint venture in which Cala has a 60% controlling interest and Glocal has a 40% interest. The
Joint Venture will seek to launch and activate up to 45,000 prepaid debit cards under the Cala brand by December 31, 2016 and
360,000 additional cards during the 2017 calendar year. Either party may terminate the agreement at December 31, 2016 if certain
objectives are not met.  

On
July 22, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Transaction Processing Products, Inc. ( TPP ) which has a
64% interest in Accent InterMedia, LLC ( AIM ) and no other assets or liabilities. AIM operates as a leading gift
card provider and in business activities very synergistic with those the Company is currently engaged in.  

On
August 10, 2016, M M, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the acquisition of Tel3 from a related party. Tel3
provides prepaid international long distance telephone services.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The accompanying
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for reporting of interim financial information. Pursuant to such rules and regulations,
certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, these statements do not include all the disclosures
normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for annual financial statements and should be
read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained
in this report. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from our unaudited financial
statements. The consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations or cash flows to be expected for any future period or for
the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management and in the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position
and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods presented. 

Effective
January 12, 2016, the Company changed its name from Pleasant Kids, Inc. ( PLKD ) to Next Group Holdings, Inc. ( NGH ).  

Basis
of Presentation   

This summary of accounting policies
for Next Group Holdings, Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The Company uses
the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP 
accounting) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

Use
of Estimates   

The preparation of unaudited consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting
for allowances for bad debts, collectability of loans receivable, potential impairment losses of the capitalized license fee and
fair value calculations related to embedded derivative features of outstanding convertible notes payable. 

Cash

For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company held
no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

As discussed in  Note 1   Organization and Description of Business Activities  the Company acquired
a majority interest in AIM through its acquisition of TPP. AIM operates as a leading gift card processing provider and carries
cash in trust on behalf of its clients. The cash is carried on the balance sheet as restricted as a result. 

Revenue
recognition    

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99 of the FASB  Accounting Standards Codification  for revenue recognition. The Company
will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and
earned when all the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

Property
and equipment    

Property and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to five years.   Maintenance and
repair costs are expensed as they are incurred while renewals and improvements which extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
At the time of retirement or disposal of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization
are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated results of operations. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, formerly SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  the
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company s ability to
recover the carrying value of its asset based on estimates of its undiscounted future cash flows. If these estimated future cash
flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset's
estimated fair value and its carrying value. There was no impairment to its long-lived assets as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

Non-Controlling
Interest   

The
Company reports the non-controlling interest in its majority owned subsidiaries in the consolidated balance sheets within the
stockholders  deficit section, separately from the Company s stockholders  deficit. Non-controlling interest
represents the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share of the equity of the Company s majority-owned
subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is adjusted for the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share of the
earnings or losses and other comprehensive income (loss) and the non-controlling interest continues to be attributed its share
of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments   

Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management
determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion
feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470, the Company will
continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under ASC 815.  

Once
determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
value of certain of the Company s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, account payable, accrued expenses,
notes payables, and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports
fair value in accordance with ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure  defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair
value investments.  

Fair
value, as defined in ASC 820, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best
use by market participants, principal (or most advantageous) markets, and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair
value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Company s credit
risk.  

Valuation
techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The
selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the
characteristics of the asset or liability, and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides
fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows:  

Level
1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;
and  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant
to the fair values.  

Fair
value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements
in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to
expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes
during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating
those gains or losses included in earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported
in the statement of income.  

Except as discussed in  Note 7  
Derivative Liabilities  the Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value in accordance with ASC 825-10 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Reclassifications   

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified
in order to conform to the current-year presentation. Reclassifications are limited to the combination of related party payables
accounts which were presented individually in the Company s 10Q filing for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. 

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Use
of net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes may be limited by Internal Revenue Code section 382 if a change of
ownership occurs.  

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share   

Basic
income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income available
to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company   had thirteen outstanding convertible notes payable with conversion rights that are
exercisable. The amount of outstanding principal on these convertible notes total $870,500 plus accrued interest of $42,751
for total convertible debts as of September 30, 2016 of $913,251 representing 35,665,724 new dilutive common shares if
converted at the applicable rates. The effects of these notes have been excluded as the conversion would be anti-dilutive due
to the net loss incurred in each period presented.  

Dividends   

The
Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown.  

As discussed in the 8K filed on May 18,
2016, the Company declared a special dividend on its outstanding common stock of one share of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock.
 Pursuant to the dividend, the special stock dividend will be distributed to owners of the Company's common stock as of the
record date in a ratio of one share of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock common stock for every 1 share of common stock owned
as of the record date.  The Company originally had set the record date as June 10, 2016 but was later modified to July 22,
2016. The Class D Preferred Stock must be redeemed within six months within six (6) months (or as soon thereafter as permitted
by law) following final resolution of the Corporation's affiliates lawsuit against ViberMedia , Inc. (Next Communications, Inc.
and Nxtgn, Inc. v. Viber Media, Inc.) which is, as of the date of this filing, pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York or any successor or other lawsuit relating to the subject matter thereof in which the Corporation (or any
successor-in-interest) is named as a plaintiff (the  Lawsuit ). The Designation fixes the redemption price of each share
of class D Preferred stock as the greater of par value or the amount obtained by dividing (a) 9.03 percent of the net proceeds
to the Corporation of the Lawsuit after payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with such law suit and the resolution
of  any creditor claims against Next Communications and all taxes on net income accrued or paid with respect to such amount,
by (b) the total number of shares of Class D Preferred stock issued and outstanding as of the Redemption Date, which amount shall
be rounded to the nearest whole cent.  

The Company has accrued common stock dividends
payable of $30,000 as of September 30, 2016.  

Advertising
Costs   

The
Company's policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance
of subtopic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Sub-topic 505-50 ) and subtopic 718-20 for awards
classified as equity to employees.   

Related
Parties   

The
registrant follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and
disclosure of related party transactions.  

Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20 the Related parties include (a) affiliates of the registrant; (b) entities for which investments in their
equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section
825 10 15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c) trusts for the benefit of employees,
such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d) principal owners of
the registrant; (e) management of the registrant; (f) other parties with which the registrant may deal if one party controls or
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) Other parties that can significantly influence the
management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties
and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests.  

The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall
include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b) description of the transactions, including transactions to which
no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other
information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar
amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the
method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d) amounts due from or to related parties as of
the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable balances are established for amounts owed to the Company from its customers from the sales of services and products.

based on estimated collections of outstanding amounts.  

Loans
Receivable   

The
Company carries loans receivable for unsecured amounts lent to unrelated and related parties. The balance due to the Company monitored

License
Fee   

The
Company entered into an agreement with a certain vendor whereby it obtained a license to market and distribute certain closed
loop general purpose reloadable debit cards for an initial term of three years. The Company remitted $250,000 as a license fee
in connection with the agreement which it is recognizing over the initial term of the agreement on a straight line basis. The
unamortized balance of the license fee was $138,889 and $201,385 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

the year ended December 31, 2014, Cala accepted a $10,000 subscription receivable that remains outstanding as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. The subscription receivable is shown as a reduction to equity on the balance sheet pursuant to ASC
505.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards    

In April 7, 2015 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update  ASU  2015-03 on  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)  To simplify
presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this Update would require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The recognition
and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs would not be affected by the amendments in this Update. This ASU 2015-3  is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter.  We reviewed
the provisions of this ASU and determined there was an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition ( ASC
605 ) and most industry-specific guidance throughout ASC 605. The standard requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective on December 15, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively
to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized
at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated
financial position and results of operations.  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 amends
the existing guidance to require that inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal,
and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory
method. ASU 2015- 11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities
arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases. The ASU will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures
to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating ASU 2016-02 and its impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations.  This Update provides clarifying
guidance regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers when another party, along with the
reporting entity, is involved in providing a good or a service to a customer. In these circumstances, an entity is required to
determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal)
or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). The
amendments in the Update clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The Update is effective,
along with ASU 2014-09, for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016- 08 is not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016- 09 ). ASU 2016-09 requires an entity to simplify
several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-09 and its
impact on its consolidated financial position or results from operations. 

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-1O ). The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606: identifying
performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The
entity first identifies the promised goods or services in the contract and reduce the cost and complexity. An entity evaluates
whether promised goods and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether an entity's
promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied
at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The Company is currently
evaluating ASU 2016-10 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption
until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.  

NOTE
3   GOING CONCERN    

The Company's unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability
and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expense, has experienced losses from operations
since inception, and it does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. Its continued existence is
dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There
can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the
Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
4   LOANS RECEIVABLE   

At
the time of the reverse recapitalization discussed in  Note 1   Organization and Description of Business , the Company
had a loan that was made to an individual totaling $40,000 which was the balance on September 30, 2016 and on December 31, 2015,

Additionally, the Company acquired a total of $83,353 of loans receivable through its acquisition of TPP as discussed in  Note
1   Organization and Description of Business . The balance due on this loan was $83,353 as of September 30, 2016. The
total loans receivable balances were $123,353 and $40,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

As
discussed in  Note 8   Related Party Transactions , during the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company made a series
of loans to the sister of Mr. Arik Maimon, our Chief Executive Officer totaling $60,000. No repayments have been made leaving
a total principal balance of $60,000 due at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These loans were not memorialized
in writing and accordingly, carry no terms as to repayment, interest or default.

own stock and is therefore not afforded equity treatment. In accordance with AC 815, the Company has bifurcated the conversion
feature of the note and recorded a derivative liability. 

The embedded derivative for the note is carried on the Company s balance sheet at fair value. The
derivative liability is marked-to-market each measurement period and any unrealized change in fair value is recorded as a component
of the income statement and the associated fair value carrying amount on the balance sheet is adjusted by the change. The
Company fair values the embedded derivative using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The note became convertible six
months after issuance or September 9, 2016. The aggregate fair value of the derivative at September 9, 2016 to be $38,357 which
was recorded on the balance sheet as a debt discount on the convertible note and will be recognized over the life of the instrument. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company marked-to-market
the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to notes and determined an aggregate fair value of $11,014 and recorded a
$27,343 gain from change in fair value of derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The fair value of the embedded
derivatives for the notes was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend
yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 655%, (3) risk-free interest rate of .29%, (4) expected life of 0.44 of a year, and (5)
estimated fair value of the Company s common stock of $0.035 per share.  

In addition to derivative liabilities associated
with convertible notes payable, the Company recorded a derivative liability due to a ratchet strike price feature associated with
the options issued in the acquisition of TPP. The options are exercisable at $0.18 per share unless the Company s common
stock is quoted at a price greater than $0.50 per share at which point the options are exercisable at $0.001 per share. At the
time of issuance, the Company measured the fair value of the options issued and recorded a derivative liability of $898,490. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company marked-to-market the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to
options and determined an aggregate fair value of $262,500 and recorded a $635,990 gain from change in fair value of derivatives
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The fair value of the embedded derivatives for the options was determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 913%,
(3) risk-free interest rate of .88%, (4) expected life of 2.79 years, and (5) estimated fair value of the Company s common
stock of $0.035 per share. 

A summary of the changes in derivative liabilities
balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

NOTE 8   STOCK OPTIONS  

The following table summarizes all stock option
activity for the nine months ended September 30: 

The following table discloses information regarding
outstanding and exercisable options at September 30, 2016: 

On May 31, 2016, the Company issue 10,000,000
options to a board member pursuant to its agreement with the member. One third of the 10,000,000 options issued vested immediately
upon execution of the related agreement, resulting in an immediate stock based expense of $558,323 being recognized. The remaining
shares of this issuance vest based on performance milestones which the Company believes is 50% likely of occurring resulting in
stock based expense of $558,328. The remaining fair value of the unvested shares will be recognized according to the estimated
probability of the performance obligations being achieved. 

On July 14, 2016, the Company issued 7,500,000 options as part of its acquisition of TPP. The options are
exercisable for a period of three years and carry an exercise price of $0.18 per share. The options carry a ratchet pricing feature
whereby they become exercisable at $0.001 per share if the Company s common stock trades at a price greater than $0.50 per
share. The options carried a value of $898,490 which was recorded as a derivative liability as discussed in  Note 7   Derivative
Liabilities . 

The Company issued 1,000,000 stock options exercisable
at $1.00 pursuant to its agreement with Glocal. This agreement was amended on August 9, 2016 in which the option owners forfeited
these options. The fair value of the 1,000,000 stock options granted with an exercise price of $1.00 was amortized through the forfeiture
resulting in stock based compensation expense of $14,166. 

Total stock based compensation expense was
$7,083 and $1,130,818 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 leaving an unrecognized expense of $558,328 as
of September 30, 2016. In determining the compensation cost of the stock options granted, the fair value of each option grant has
been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in these calculations are
summarized as follows:

determined the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the agreement using the close price of our common stock as quoted by
the OTCBB on February 11, 2016 of $0.2244 per share. The Company did not execute its option to purchase a controlling interest

NOTE 12   CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION  

The Company did not have any one customer account
for more than 10% of its revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2015 or 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company generated 14% and 91% of its revenues from five and six separate customers, respectively. Of the 91%
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 40% was from related parties. The loss of any one of these customers would have
a material adverse effect on the Company s operations. The concentration of revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were: 

NOTE 13   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

If the assessment of a contingency indicates
that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated
liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential
material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of
the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. 

On April 7, 2016, the Company executed an
agreement with a third party to provide certain services for the Company. The agreement requires 1% of the outstanding common
share equivalent to be issued to the third party when the market capitalization of the Company reaches $500,000,000 and an additional
1% when it reached $750,000,000. The probability of this event is uncertain at present and the Company has not accrued a contingent
loss as of September 30, 2016 as a result.  

On September 20, 2016, the Company received
a notice it has been named as a defendant in a suit brought against Next Communications, an entity controlled by our CEO. In addition
to being named a defendant, it was requested the Company provide certain documents for the discovery process. Due to the original
suit being filed against a related party and not against the Company or its subsidiaries, we believe it likely the Company and
its subsidiaries be dismissed as defendants and has not accrued a contingent loss as of September 30 as a result. 

NOTE 14   ACQUISITIONS  

Transaction Processing Products, Inc.   

As discussed in  Note 1   Organization
and Description of Business  Company completed its acquisition of Transaction Processing Products, Inc. ( TPP )
on July 22, 2016. The Company executed two separate agreements as part of the transaction; the first to purchase outstanding debt
totaling $5.2 million owed by TPP to the seller in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of common stock and 7,500,000 options to purchase
additional shares of stock at $0.18 per share and the second to purchase the sellers interest in Accent InterMedia, LLC for cash
consideration of $10. Where the agreements were executed simultaneously, they were accounted for as a single transaction. The
common shares issued were valued at $1,270,000 and the options issued at $898,490 resulting in total consideration of $2,168,500
when combined with the $10 of cash paid. The Company assumed net liabilities of $1,792,912 at fair value and identifiable intangible
assets totaling $1,310,058, resulting in goodwill of $2,651,354. Net liabilities assumed consisted of the following: 

Goodwill  

Goodwill of $2.65 million represents the excess
of consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed
and is attributable to TPPs strategic position value and projected profits from new products. 

Identifiable Intangible Assets  

The Company acquired intangible assets
that consisted of client contracts and client relationships which had estimated fair values of $93,190 and $1,216,868, respectively.
The value of the identifiable intangible assets has yet to be verified by an independent valuation expert and as such, the values
are subject to future measurement period adjustments. The intangible assets were measured at fair value using an income approach
that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The Company will amortize the intangible assets on a straight line
basis over their expected useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets were recorded as follows: 

Tel3   

As discussed in  Note 1   Organization
and Description of Business  Company completed its acquisition of Tel3 on August 9, 2016 from a related party for cash considerations
of $10. As part of the acquisition, the company assumed net liabilities of $780,137 whose book values equaled fair values at the
time of acquisition. The Company did not record goodwill for the amount of consideration in excess of the fair values of net liabilities
assumed due to the acquisition being from a related party. The excess instead was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in
capital. Net liabilities assumed consisted of the following: 

Pro Forma Information   

The unaudited pro forma information
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 presented below include the effects of the TPP acquisition as if
it had been consummated as of July 22, 2015, and the Tel3 acquisition had it been consummated on August 10, 2015 with adjustments
to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions, specifically adjustments related to the
amortization of acquired intangible assets in TPP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These adjustments are
based upon information and assumptions available to us at the time of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the
unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the actual
results of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented, nor is
it indicative of the future results of operations. 

NOTE 15   RESTATEMENT   

The Company filed its Form 10Q for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 on November 21, 2016 in which it disclosed in  Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

miscommunication. The special dividend has not been rescinded and the Company has restated its financial statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as a result. The impacts of the restatement are:  

There was no impact on the Company s statements

On July 22, 2016, the Company entered
into four separate agreements with convertible note holders agreed not to convert any amount of outstanding principal or accrued
interest to shares of common stock for a period of 60 days. These agreements were extended for an additional 30 days upon expiration
on September 22, 2016 then an additional 30 days upon expiration of the original extensions on October 22, 2016. Currently, the
agreements will expire on November 26, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may prepay the outstanding principal
and accrued interest of the notes for 130% of the then outstanding amounts. Additionally, the Company amended the notes with Noteholder

Results of operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Revenue  

Total revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, were $515,230, compared to revenue of $41,527 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from non-related parties totaled $502,472 and revenues from related parties totaled
$12,758 compared to $42,146 from non-related parties and ($619) from related parties during the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in revenue was due to the acquisitions of TPP and Tel3 which contributed revenues of $113,812 and $387,703,
respectively, representing total revenues of $501,515 from acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Cost of Goods Sold  

The Company incurred total cost of goods sold of $441,907 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $164,002 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting in gross margins of $73,322 and negative $122,475. The increase
in gross margins was due to the elimination of variable costs of revenue from the decline in services being provided during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. These services have been discontinued given the losses
incurred on the service. Additionally, the Company experienced improved gross margins from its acquisitions of each TPP and Tel3
as each business has a history of profitability. 

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, were $1,868,409 compared to $101,669 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses
were greater in the three months ended September 30, 2016 due mainly to an increase in professional services of $1,296,012 due
to common shares valued at $1,065,039 being issued for professional fees and the reverse recapitalization transaction and incremental
costs associated with operating as a public company. Additionally, officer and director compensation increased $139,146 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased management
and board costs associated with operating as a public company and stock based compensation to directors totaling $7,083 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Loss from Operations  

Loss from operations was $1,795,087 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $224,144
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in losses from operations is the result of decreased revenue, higher
cost of revenue and higher operating expenses as discussed previously. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Total other income (expense) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a net gain of $779,222 compared
to $25,000 for the same period in 2015. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $412,017, and is the
result of the recognition of debt discounts associated with convertible notes payable, excess fair market value of derivative liabilities
being charged to interest upon initial measurement, imputed interest on related party loans and interest accruals on outstanding
debt. The Company did not incur interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as there was not outstanding
debt at that time. Additionally, the Company recorded a gain on the change in fair market values of derivative liabilities of $1,191,239
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as the liabilities
did not exist during the 2015 calendar year. The Company cannot predict the losses or gains from the changes in the fair market
values of outstanding derivative liabilities due the variables involved but does not anticipate recording the same amount of gains
in future periods. 

Net Loss  

Net loss before non-controlling interest
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,015,865 compared to a loss of $199,144 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is due mainly to an increase in operating costs of
$1,766,740 and an increase in interest expense of $412,017.

to $343,620 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulting in gross margins of $9,038 and negative $74,042. The decrease
in gross margins was due to the decline in services being provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared

were greater in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due mainly to an increase in professional services of $2,751,858 due to
common shares valued at $2,130,077 being issued for professional fees and the reverse recapitalization transaction and incremental
costs associated with operating as a public company. Additionally, officer and director compensation increased $1,390,767during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased management and

to $25,000 for the same period in 2015. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,302,199, and is the
result of the recognition of debt discounts associated with convertible notes payable, the excess fair market value of derivatives

did not incur interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as there was not outstanding debt at that time.

of outstanding derivative liabilities due the variables involved but does not anticipate recording the same amount of gains in
future periods.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $4,765,329 compared to a loss of $478,690 for the nine months ended September

and $0 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Operational Activities  

The Company used $967,736 of cash in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $494,848
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s primary uses of cash have been for professional support, marketing
expenses and working capital. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of
a net loss of $4,765,329, non-cash losses and gains totaling $3,069,163 and changes in working capital of $728,430. All cash received
has been expended in the furtherance of growing future operations. 

Investing Activities  

The Company generated $85,486 of cash from
investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $75,247 used during the nine months ended September

The Company had net cash proceeds of $998,801
from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $543,487 during the nine months ended September

of $30,000 and proceeds from related party loans of $512,906. 

The Company may not have sufficient resources
to fully develop any new products or expand our market area unless it is able to raise additional financing. The Company can make
no assurances these required funds will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If additional capital is raised through the
sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
Additionally, these conditions may increase costs to raise capital and/or result in further dilution. The failure to raise capital
when needed, will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could force the Company to
reduce or cease operations. 

The Company believes that
it will be able to meet the costs of growth and public reporting with funds generated from operations and additional amounts generated
through debt and equity financing, Although management believes that the required financing to fund product development and increasing
inventory levels can be secured at terms satisfactory to the Company, there is no guarantee these funds will be made available,
and if funds are available, that the terms will be satisfactory to the Company. 

Impact of Inflation  

The Company does not expect inflation to be
a significant factor in operation of the business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements
between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial conditions,
changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to stockholders. 

Going Concern  

The Company has a working capital deficiency of $8,474,884 and accumulated deficit of $8,515,517 as of September
30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent on the ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon The Company s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Management believes that the application of
these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results
and financial condition. Some of the critical accounting estimates are detailed below. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and New Accounting
Pronouncements 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be
critical if: 

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and   

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.   

The Company base estimates and judgments on
experience, current knowledge, and beliefs of what could occur in the future, observation of trends in the industry, information
provided by customers and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that are believed
to be the most critical to the financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective
and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense, income taxes, and
derivative financial instruments. 

Share-Based Compensation Expense   

We calculate share-based compensation expense
for option awards and warrant issuances ( Share-based Awards ) based on the estimated grant/issue-date fair value using
the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model ( Black-Scholes Model ), and recognize the expense on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions
including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting period of the Share-based
Award in determining the fair value of Share-based Awards. Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation
expense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which are open to interpretation and
inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded
in a given period. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might
have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .
We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.
The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

The Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, and as discussed in greater detail below, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and procedures are
not effective:  

to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that are file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and   

to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are file or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and our Treasurer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

On October 14, 2014, one of our operating subsidiaries,
NxtGn, Inc. and Next Communications, Inc., an entity controlled by our CEO, (collectively the  Plaintiffs ) filed
suit in the United States District Court for the Southern district of New York against Viber Media, Inc.  Plaintiffs filed
an Amended Complaint asserting four claims: misappropriation of a business idea, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of
contract, and unjust enrichment.  Viber moved the Court to dismiss the Amended Complaint.  On March 30, 2016, U.S. District
Judge Richard Sullivan issued an opinion and order on Viber s motion to Dismiss.  Specifically, Judge Sullivan ordered
that Viber s motion to dismiss is granted on Plaintiffs  misappropriation of a business idea claim, but denied as
to their misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment claims.  

On September 20, 2016, the Company received
a notice it has been named as a defendant in a suit brought against Next Communications, an entity controlled by our CEO. In addition
to being named a defendant, it was requested the Company provide certain documents for the discovery process. Due to the original
suit being filed against a related party and not against the Company or its subsidiaries, we believe it likely the Company and
its subsidiaries be dismissed as defendants.

(2)  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary

      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all

(4)  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls

(a)  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,

    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

(b)  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

(5)  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control

    (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

(a)  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

(b)  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
