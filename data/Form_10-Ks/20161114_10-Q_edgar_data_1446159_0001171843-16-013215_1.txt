NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Nature of Operations and Continuance of Operations  

On October 27, 2016, the Company effected a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of its common
stock. All share information in the financial statements for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of the reverse stock
split. 

Skyline Medical Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 2002. Effective August 6, 2013, the Company changed its name to Skyline Medical Inc.
As of September 30, 2016, the registrant had 3,404,860 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, outstanding. Pursuant
to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated effective December 16, 2013, the Company merged with and into a Delaware corporation with
the same name that was its wholly-owned subsidiary, with such Delaware Corporation as the surviving corporation of the merger.
The Company has developed an environmentally safe system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids that result from
surgical procedures and post-operative care. The Company also makes ongoing sales of our proprietary cleaning fluid and filters
to users of our systems. In April 2009, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to authorize the Company to market and
sell its STREAMWAY  FMS products. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and had a stockholders 
deficit until August 31, 2015 whereupon the Company closed its public offering of units of common stock, Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock and Series A Warrants (the  Units ). There remains though, substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Since inception to September 30, 2016, the Company raised approximately
$22,325,091 in equity, inclusive of $2,055,000 from a private placement of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $13,555,003 from
the public offering of Units and $5,685,000 in debt financing. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

Recent Accounting Developments  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  and created a new topic in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
("ASC"), Topic 606. The new standard provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition framework for all entities and
supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle
of the revenue model is that an entity should recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. The standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and also
requires enhanced disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance
may have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  "Compensation
- Stock Compensation"  providing explicit guidance on how to account for share-based payments granted to employees in which
the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period.
The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our financial
statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The new standard requires management to assess an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective
for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented on the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts, rather than as an asset. Amortization
of these costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have an impact on our
financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic
330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs
of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our financial
statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income
Taxes (Topic 740)  providing guidance on the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The guidance requires that deferred
tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the Balance Sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact this guidance may have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial
Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ("ASU
2016-01"). The standard changes how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial
liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. Under the new guidance, entities will
be required to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method
at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicability exception.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases 
(Topic 842    ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize
the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. The standard states that a lessee would recognize
a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset
for the lease term. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact that the updated standard
will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation
- Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accountin g  ( ASU 2016-09 ).
ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective
for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

During August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public business entities
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied
using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If retrospective application is impractical for some of the issues
addressed by the update, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Early
adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have
a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

We reviewed all other significant newly issued accounting
pronouncements and determined they are either not applicable to our business or that no material effect is expected on our financial
position and results of our operations. 

Valuation of Intangible Assets  

We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance
with ASC 350   Intangibles  Goodwill and Other, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. Our intangible assets are currently solely the costs of obtaining trademarks and patents. Events or changes
in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant change
in the medical device marketplace and a significant adverse change in the business climate in which we operate. If such events
or changes in circumstances are present, the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the intangible asset is
impaired. Cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges. If the carrying
value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset, the asset is considered
impaired, and the impairment is measured by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value using the discounted cash
flows method. The discount rate utilized is based on management s best estimate of the related risks and return at the time
the impairment assessment is made. 

Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Presentation of Taxes Collected from Customers  

Sales taxes are imposed on the Company s sales to nonexempt
customers. The Company collects the taxes from customers and remits the entire amounts to the governmental authorities. The Company s
accounting policy is to exclude the taxes collected and remitted from revenues and expenses. 

Shipping and Handling  

Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are recorded
as revenue. Shipping and handling costs are recorded within cost of goods sold on the statement of operations. 

Advertising  

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses
were $10,343 and $57,004 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and were $500 and $1,917 in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and Development  

Research and development costs are charged to operations as
incurred. Research and development expenses were $79,936 and $302,330 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
were $58,792 and $179,739 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the SEC s
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 Revenue Recognition and ASC 605-Revenue Recognition. 

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. Delivery is considered to have
occurred upon either shipment of the product or arrival at its destination based on the shipping terms of the transaction. The
Company s standard terms specify that shipment is FOB Skyline and the Company will, therefore, recognize revenue upon shipment
in most cases. This revenue recognition policy applies to shipments of the STREAMWAY FMS units as well as shipments of filters
and fluids. When these conditions are satisfied, the Company recognizes gross product revenue, which is the price it charges generally
to its customers for a particular product. Under the Company s standard terms and conditions, there is no provision for installation
or acceptance of the product to take place prior to the obligation of the customer. The customer s right of return is limited
only to the Company s standard one-year warranty whereby the Company replaces or repairs, at its option, and it would be
rare that the STREAMWAY FMS unit or significant quantities of cleaning solution or filters may be returned. Additionally, since
the Company buys the STREAMWAY FMS units, cleaning solution and filters from  turnkey  suppliers, the Company would
have the right to replacements from the suppliers if this situation should occur. 

Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with
a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximate
fair value. 

Certificates of Deposit  

Short-term interest bearing investments are those with maturities
of less than one year but greater than three months when purchased. Certificates with maturity dates beyond one year are classified
as noncurrent assets. These investments are readily convertible to cash and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates
fair value. 

Investment Securities  

Readily marketable investments in debt and equity securities
are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive
income. Unrealized gains are charged to earnings when an incline in fair value above the cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Realized gains and losses on dispositions are based on the net proceeds and the adjusted book value of the securities sold, using
the specific identification method. 

Fair Value Measurements  

Under generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in
the Financial Accounting Standards Board s  Accounting Standards Certification  (ASC) 820, fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. The accounting standards ASC 820 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information
used in developing assumptions when pricing as asset or liability as follows: 

Level 1   Observable inputs such as
quoted prices in active markets; 

Level 2   Inputs other than quoted
prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3   Unobservable inputs where
there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The Company uses observable market data, when available, in
making fair value measurements. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant
to the valuation. 

The fair value of the Company s investment securities
were determined based on Level 1 inputs. 

Receivables  

Receivables are reported at the amount the Company expects to
collect on balances outstanding. The Company provides for probable uncollectible amounts through charges to earnings and credits
to the valuation based on management s assessment of the current status of individual accounts, changes to the valuation
allowance have not been material to the financial statements. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with
cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory balances are as follows: 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets. Estimated useful asset life by classification is as follows: 

Years   
 
      Computers and office equipment  
       
      3  
      -  
      7   
 
      Leasehold improvements  

5

      3  
      -  
      7   
 
      Demo Equipment  

3  

The Company s investment in Fixed Assets consists of the
following: 

Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to operations as incurred. 

Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets consist of trademarks and patent costs. Amortization
expense was $2,515 and $6,225 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and was $1,632 and $4,520 in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The assets are reviewed for impairment annually, and impairment losses, if any, are charged
to operations when identified. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC
740- Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted
tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. 

The Company reviews income tax positions expected to be taken
in income tax returns to determine if there are any income tax uncertainties. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain
tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities,
based on technical merits of the positions. The Company has identified no income tax uncertainties. 

Tax years subsequent to 2012 remain open to examination by federal
and state tax authorities. 

Patents and Intellectual Property  

On January 25th, 2014 the Company filed a non-provisional PCT
Application No. PCT/US2014/013081 claiming priority from the U.S. Provisional Patent Application, number 61756763 which was filed
one year earlier on January 25th, 2013. The Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT ) allows an applicant to file a single
patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the 148 countries of the PCT, including
the United States. By filing this single  international  patent application through the PCT, it is easier and more
cost effective than filing separate applications directly with each national or regional patent office in which patent protection
is desired. 

Our PCT patent application is for the new model of the surgical
fluid waste management system. We obtained a favorable International Search Report from the PCT searching authority indicating
that the claims in our PCT application are patentable (i.e., novel and non-obvious) over the cited prior art. A feature claimed
in the PCT application is the ability to maintain continuous suction to the surgical field while measuring, recording and evacuating
fluid to the facilities sewer drainage system. This provides for continuous operation of the STREAMWAY System unit in suctioning
waste fluids, which means that suction is not interrupted during a surgical operation, for example, to empty a fluid collection
container or otherwise dispose of the collected fluid. 

The Company holds the following granted patents in the United
States and a pending application in the United States on its earlier models: US7469727, US8123731 and U.S. Publication No. US20090216205
(collectively, the  Patents ). These Patents will begin to expire on August 8, 2023. 

In July 2015, Skyline Medical filed an international (PCT) patent
application for its fluid waste collection system and received a favorable determination by the International Searching Authority
finding that all of the claims satisfy the requirements for novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. Skyline anticipates
that the favorable International Search Report will result in allowance of its various national applications. 

Credit Risk  

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. The Company has a credit risk concentration as a result
of depositing $454,369 of funds in excess of insurance limits in a single bank.

Segments  

The Company operates in one segment for the sale of its medical
device and consumable products. Substantially all of the Company s assets, revenues and expenses for the three and nine months
ending September 30, 2016 and for 2015 in entirety were located at or derived from operations in the United States. There were

Subsequent Events  

The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment effecting a 1:25 reverse stock split (the
 Reverse Stock Split  with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective under Delaware law
at 5:00 p.m. New York time on October 27, 2016. The Company s common stock opened for trading on October 28, 2016 on a post-split
basis. At the effective time (the  Effective Time ) of the Reverse Stock Split, the issued and outstanding Common Stock
of the Company was combined on a 1-for-25 basis such that every twenty-five shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time was combined into one share of Common Stock. The share combination was effected through the exchange and
replacement of certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Effective Time, together with
immediate book-entry adjustments to the stock register of the Company maintained in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law. In the event that the share combination would have resulted in a shareholder being entitled to receive less than a full share
of Common Stock, the fractional share that would so result was rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. The par value
of each share of issued and outstanding Common Stock was not affected by the share combination. 

Interim Financial Statements  

The Company has prepared the unaudited interim financial statements
and related unaudited financial information in the footnotes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
for interim financial statements. These interim financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals,
which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the interim periods. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
annual financial statements and the notes thereto contained in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2016. The nature of
the Company s business is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be expected
for the entire year. 

NOTE 2   DEVELOPMENT STAGE OPERATIONS  

The Company was formed April 23, 2002. Since inception to October 24, 2016, 3,804,860
shares of common stock have been issued between par value and $3,131.25 (as adjusted for the reverse stock split). Operations since
incorporation have been devoted to raising capital, obtaining financing, development of the Company s product, and administrative
services, customer acceptance and sales and marketing strategies. 

NOTE 3   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT, STOCK OPTIONS
AND WARRANTS  

The Company has an equity incentive plan, which allows issuance
of incentive and non-qualified stock options to employees, directors and consultants of the Company, where permitted under the
plan. The exercise price for each stock option is determined by the Board of Directors. Vesting requirements are determined by
the Board of Directors when granted and currently range from immediate to three years. Options under this plan have terms ranging
from three to ten years. 

Public Offering of Units 

On August 31, 2015 (the  Issuance Date ), the Company
completed a public offering (the  Offering ) of 1,666,667 Units (the  Units ) as described below. The public
offering price in the Offering was $9.00 per Unit, and the purchase price for the underwriter of the Offering (the  Underwriter )
was $8.28 per Unit, resulting in an underwriting discount and commission of $0.72 (or 8.00%) per Unit and total net proceeds to
the Company before expenses of $13.8 million. The Company had granted the Underwriter an option for a period of 45 days to purchase
up to an additional 250,000 Units solely to cover over-allotments. The Underwriter chose not to purchase any additional Units under
the over-allotment option. The Company paid to the Underwriter a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 1% of the gross proceeds
of the Offering and agreed to reimburse expenses incurred by the Underwriter up to $70,000. 

On August 31, 2015, as a result of the consummation of the Offering and the issuance
of the 228,343 Exchange Units in the Unit Exchange described below, the Company issued a total of 1,895,010 Units, comprised of
a total of aggregate of 75,800 shares of Common Stock (as adjusted for the reverse stock split), 1,895,010 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock and 7,580,040 Series A Warrants, (as adjusted for the reverse stock split). 

Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the  Common Stock ), one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series B Preferred
Stock ) and four Series A Warrants. The shares of Common Stock, the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the Series A Warrants
that comprise the Units automatically separated on February 29, 2016. 

For a description of the terms of the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock included within the Units, see  Series B Preferred Stock  below. For a description of the terms of the Series
A Warrants included within the Units, see  Series A Warrants  below. 

Series A Warrants.  The Series A Warrants separated from the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock included within the Units as described above and are currently exercisable. The Series A Warrants
terminate on August 31, 2020. Each Series A Warrant is exercisable into one share of Common Stock at an initial cash exercise price
of $123.75 per share. The Cash exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon cash exercise is subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting the Common Stock and the
exercise price. 

Holders may exercise Series A Warrants by paying the exercise
price in cash or, in lieu of payment of the exercise price in cash, by electing to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the Black-Scholes Value (as defined below) based upon the number of shares the holder elects to exercise. The number of shares
of Common Stock to be delivered according to the following formula, referred to as the  Cashless Exercise.  

Total Shares = (A x B)/C 

Where: 

Total shares is the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon a Cashless Exercise.   

A is the total number of shares with respect to which the Series A Warrant is then being exercised.   

B is the Black-Scholes Value (as defined below).   

C is the closing bid price of the Common Stock as of two trading days prior to the time of such exercise, provided that in no event may  C  be less than $0.43 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits or similar events affecting the Common Stock).   

The Black-Scholes Value (as defined above) as of September 30, 2016 was $4.319, and the
closing bid price of Common Stock as of September 30, 2016, was $4.125. Therefore, an exercise on that date would have resulted
in the issuance of .40 shares of Common Stock for each Series A Warrant. Approximately 6,141,115 Series A Warrants have been exercised
in cashless exercises as of September 30, 2016, resulting in the issuance of 2,318,663 shares of Common Stock. If all of the remaining
35,084 Series A Warrants that were issued as part of the Units sold in the Offering and part of the Units issued on August 31,
2015 were exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise and the closing bid price of our common stock as of the two trading days prior
to the time of such exercise was $10.75 per share or less and the Black-Scholes Value were $4.319 (the Black-Scholes Value as of
September 30, 2016), then a total of an additional approximately 564 shares of our common stock would be issued to the holders
of such Series A Warrants. 

The Series A Warrants will not be exercisable or exchangeable
by the holder of such warrants to the extent (and only to the extent) that the holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially
own in excess of 4.99% of the common stock of the Company, determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

In addition to (but not duplicative of) the adjustments to the
exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants in the event of stock dividends,
stock splits, reorganizations or similar events, the Series A Warrants provide for certain adjustments if the Company, at any time
prior to the three year anniversary of the Issuance Date, (1) declares or makes any dividend or other distribution of its assets
(or rights to acquire its assets) to all or substantially all of the holders of shares of Common Stock at any time after the Issuance
Date, or (2) grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other
property pro rata to all or substantially all of the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock. Further, if at any
time a Series A Warrant is outstanding, the Company consummates any fundamental transaction, as described in the Series A Warrants
and generally including any consolidation or merger into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets,
or other transaction in which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for other securities or other consideration, the
holder of any Series A Warrants will thereafter receive, the securities or other consideration to which a holder or the number
of shares of Common Stock then deliverable upon the exercise or exchange of such Series A Warrants would have been entitled upon
such consolidation or merger or other transaction. 

Unit Purchase Option.  The Company, in connection with the Offering, entered into
a Unit Purchase Option Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2015 (the  Unit Purchase Option ), pursuant to which the Company
granted the Underwriter the right to purchase from the Company up to a number of Units equal to 5% of the Units sold in the Offering
(or up to 83,333 Units) or the component securities of such Units at an exercise price equal to 125% of the public offering price
of the Units in the Offering, or $11.25 per Unit. The Unit Purchase Option was terminated in May 2016 in exchange for 135,995 shares
of common stock. 

Series B Preferred Stock.  Each share of Series B Preferred
Stock became convertible into one share of Common Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock
splits, reorganizations or similar events) as of February 29, 2016. In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically
convert into shares of common stock upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction, as described in the certificate of designations
for the Series B Preferred Stock but including mergers, shares of the company s assets, changes in control and similar transactions.
The Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible by the holder of such preferred stock to the extent (and only to the extent that
the holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the common stock of the Company. The Series B
Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except for the right to approve certain amendments to the certificate of designations or
similar actions. With respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation or dissolution or winding up
of the Company, the Series B Preferred Stock shall rank equal to the common stock of the Company. No sinking fund has been established
for the retirement or redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. 

Unit Exchange.  On February 4, 2014, the Company raised $2,055,000 in gross proceeds
from a private placement of 20,550 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01, with a stated value of $100
per share (the  Series A Preferred Shares ) and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. The
Series A Preferred Shares and warrants were sold to investors pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February
4, 2014. On August 31, 2015, the Company issued a total of 228,343 Units (the  Exchange Units ) in exchange for the
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock which were then cancelled pursuant to an agreement with the holders of the Series A Preferred
Shares. The warrants that were issued in connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares remained outstanding; however,
the warrant amounts were reduced so that the warrants are exercisable into an aggregate of 3,391 shares of the Company s
common stock. The Exchange Units were exempt from registration under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. On August 31, 2015,
the Company filed a termination certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State. Following that date there were no shares of Series
A Preferred Stock outstanding, and the previously authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock resumed the status of authorized
but issued and undesignated shares of preferred stock of the Company. 

Redemption of Convertible Notes.  In connection with the
closing of the Offering, $933,074 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes plus interest and a 40% redeemable premium were
redeemed for total payments of $1,548,792. See Note 4. Of this amount, approximately $167,031 was paid to its affiliates in redemption
of their Convertible Notes. 

Registered Exchange Offer for Warrants.  On March 25, 2016, the Company commenced
a registered exchange offer (the  Exchange Offer ) to exchange Series B Warrants (the  Series B Warrants )
to purchase shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Warrant Shares ), for up to an aggregate of
3,157,186 outstanding Series A Warrants (the  Series A Warrants ). On March 31, 2016, each Series A Warrant could be
exercised on a cashless basis for 10.05 shares of common stock. Each Series B Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis for
one share of common stock. For each outstanding Series A Warrant tendered by holders, we offered to issue 10.2 Series B Warrants,
which are subject to cashless exercise at a fixed rate of one share of common stock per Series B Warrant (subject to further adjustment
for stock splits, etc.). The Exchange Offer expired at midnight, Eastern time, on April 21, 2016. 1,770,556 Series A Warrants were
tendered by holders. The Company delivered an aggregate of 18,059,671 Series B Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer.
In addition, between March 31, 2016 and July 6, 2016 1,251,510 Series A Warrants were exercised in cashless exercises, resulting
in the issuance of 503,034 shares of common stock. 

Accounting for share-based payment  

The Company has adopted ASC 718- Compensation-Stock Compensation
("ASC 718"). Under ASC 718 stock-based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for
all new awards granted after January 1, 2006 and unvested awards outstanding at January 1, 2006. Compensation costs for unvested
stock options and non-vested awards that were outstanding at January 1, 2006, are being recognized over the requisite service period
based on the grant-date fair value of those options and awards, using a straight-line method. We elected the modified-prospective
method under which prior periods are not retroactively restated. 

ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock-based
payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model or other acceptable means. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option valuation model which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time
employees will retain vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock price
over the expected term, the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements, the expected
dividend rate and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based
compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognized. The assumptions the Company uses in calculating the fair value
of stock-based payment awards represent the Company's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application
of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company's equity-based
compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 

Since the Company's common stock has no significant public trading
history, and the Company has experienced no significant option exercises in its history, the Company is required to take an alternative
approach to estimating future volatility and estimated life and the future results could vary significantly from the Company's
estimates. The Company compiled historical volatilities over a period of 2 to 7 years of 15 small-cap medical companies traded
on major exchanges and 10 mid-range medical companies on the OTC Bulletin Board and combined the results using a weighted average
approach. In the case of ordinary options to employees the Company determined the expected life to be the midpoint between the
vesting term and the legal term. In the case of options or warrants granted to non-employees, the Company estimated the life to
be the legal term unless there was a compelling reason to make it shorter. 

When an option or warrant is granted in place of cash compensation
for services, the Company deems the value of the service rendered to be the value of the option or warrant. In most cases, however,
an option or warrant is granted in addition to other forms of compensation and its separate value is difficult to determine without
utilizing an option pricing model. For that reason the Company also uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value options
and warrants granted to non-employees, which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average
period the investors or consultants will retain vested stock options and warrants before exercising them, the estimated volatility
of the Company's common stock price over the expected term, the number of options and warrants that will ultimately be forfeited
before completing vesting requirements, the expected dividend rate and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in the assumptions
can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based consulting and/or compensation and, consequently, the related expense
recognized. 

Since the Company has limited trading history in its stock and
no first-hand experience with how its investors and consultants have acted in similar circumstances, the assumptions the Company
uses in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent its best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company's
equity-based consulting and interest expense could be materially different in the future. 

Valuation and accounting for options and warrants  

The Company determines the grant date fair value of options
and warrants using a Black-Scholes option valuation model based upon assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected dividend
rate, volatility and estimated term. 

In January 2014 the Company issued 174 shares of common stock
to the former CEO at $31.25 per share upon his exercising options.

an immediate approximately 11% reduction to the warrant agreement. Therefore, the warrant has been adjusted to purchase 194 shares
of common stock at an exercise price of $309.50 to SOK Partners, LLC in consideration for a bridge loan. 

In July 2014, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,160

notes. The shares above reflect approximately an 11% reduction resulting from the Resale Registration Statement that went effective
September 9, 2014. 

In August 2014, the Company issued warrants to purchase 2,462
of common stock at an exercise price of $609.50 to the Purchasers of the Preferred Shares. The Securities Purchase Agreement with
the Preferred Shareholders stipulated that if the Company was not listed on either the NASDAQ Stock Market, the New York Stock
Exchange or the NYSE MKT within 180 days of closing the agreement then warrants to purchase the above additional shares would be
issued in aggregate to the Preferred Shareholders.

were issued to 16 holders of Preferred Shares. 

For grants of stock options and warrants in 2014 the Company

The following table is the listing of stock options and warrants
as of September 30, 2016 by year of grant: 

NOTE 4   SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE   

From July through September 2014, we entered into a series of
securities purchase agreements pursuant to which we issued approximately $1.8 million original principal amount (subsequently reduced
to approximately $1.6 million aggregate principal amount in accordance with their terms) of convertible promissory notes (the  2014
Convertible Notes ) and warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,475,000.
Of this amount, we issued to SOK Partners, LLC, an affiliate of the Company, $122,196 original principal amount of the 2014 Convertible
Notes and warrants exercisable for 218 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000. In April and May
2015, we issued and sold to a private investor additional Convertible Notes in an aggregate original principal amount of $275,000
for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000, containing terms substantially similar to the 2014 Convertible Notes (the  2015
Convertible Notes  and, together with the 2014 Convertible Notes, the  Convertible Notes ). No warrants were
issued with the 2015 Convertible Notes. 

Under a provision in the existing agreements, upon effectiveness
of a resale registration statement covering certain shares, on September 9, 2014, the principal amount of the notes was reduced
by 11%, to $1,603,260 and the number of Warrants was reduced by 11%, to 2,851 shares. 

As of September 30, 2016 $927,663 aggregate principal amount
of Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereto, have been converted into shares of our common stock and no aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Notes remains outstanding. 

In connection with the Offering, the
holders of the Convertible Notes agreed to not exercise their right to convert the Convertible Notes into shares of the Company s
common stock, in exchange for the Company s agreement to redeem all of the outstanding Convertible Notes promptly following
the consummation of the Offering at a redemption price equal to 140% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the redemption date. On August 31, 2015, the closing date of the offering, the Company redeemed the remaining $933,074 aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Notes plus interest and a 40% redeemable premium, for a total payment of $1,548,792. Of this amount,
approximately $167,031 was paid to its affiliates in redemption of their Convertible Notes. Each holder of the Convertible Notes
agreed to the foregoing terms and entered into an Amendment to Senior Convertible Notes and Agreement with the Company. As of September
30, 2016, none of the Convertible Notes were outstanding. 

NOTE 5 - LOSS PER SHARE  

The following table presents the shares used in the basic and
diluted loss per common share computations: 

(1) The number of shares underlying options and warrants outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are 222,600 and 343,554 respectively. The effect of the shares that would be issued
upon exercise of such options, warrants and preferred stock has been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because
those shares are anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 6   INCOME TAXES  

Availability and Utilization of Net Operating Losses 

During September 2013, the Company experienced an  ownership
change  as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code which could potentially limit the ability to utilize the Company s
net operating losses (NOLs). The general limitation rules allow the Company to utilize its NOLs subject to an annual limitation
that is determined by multiplying the federal long-term tax-exempt rate by the Company s value immediately before the ownership
change. 

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company likely had another
ownership change that could further limit the Company s ability to fully utilize its NOLs however, the determination of the
annual limitation has not yet been made. 

Income Taxes 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $24.7 million
of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, the majority of which are expected to be available for use in 2016, subject
to the Section 382 limitation described above. The federal NOLs will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. The Company also had approximately
$13.4 million of gross NOLs to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2015, which will expire in years 2022 through
2036 if unused. The Company s net deferred tax assets, which include the NOLs, are subject to a full valuation allowance.
At December 31, 2015, the federal and state valuation allowances were $9.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $29.2 million
of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, the majority of which are expected to be available for use in 2017, subject
to the Section 382 limitations described above. The federal NOLs will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. The Company also had
approximately $15.0 million of gross NOLs to reduce future state taxable income at September 30, 2016, which will expire in years
2022 through 2037 if unused. The Company s net deferred tax assets, which include the NOLs, are subject to a full valuation
allowance. At September 30, 2016, the federal and state valuation allowances were $10.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. 

The components of deferred income taxes at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

NOTE 7   RENT OBLIGATION  

The Company leases its principal office under a lease that can
be cancelled after three years with proper notice per the lease and an amortized schedule of adjustments that will be due to the
landlord. The lease extends five years and expires January 2018. In addition to rent, the Company pays real estate taxes and repairs
and maintenance on the leased property. Rent expense was $16,356 and $50,106 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and was $15,900 and $50,156 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively. 

The Company s rent obligation for the next three years
is as follows: 

NOTE 8   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

The Audit Committee has the responsibility to review and approve
all transactions to which a related party and the Company may be a party prior to their implementation, to assess whether such
transactions meet applicable legal requirements. 

In connection with the sale of the Series A Preferred Share
on February 4, 2014, Josh Kornberg, our former, and then President, CEO and Interim Chairman of the Board, was one of the Purchasers.
Mr. Kornberg purchased 770 Preferred Shares for a purchase price of $25,000 and received warrants to purchase 3 shares of common
stock. 

SOK Partners, LLC ( SOK ), a large stockholder with
Mr. Kornberg and Dr. Samuel Herschkowitz as managing partners, invested in the July 2014 offering of convertible notes and warrants.
In November 2014, the convertible noteholders agreed to convert certain balances of the convertible notes in connection with the
public offering of the Existing Units, in consideration of the agreement to issue certain additional shares. See  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   History
Financing   2014 Sales of Convertible Notes and Warrants.  In connection with the Unit Offering in August 2015, all
such convertible notes were redeemed at a redemption price of 140% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Company paid approximately $163,000 to SOK in redemption of its convertible note. In addition, Rick Koenigsberger, a former
director who resigned on June 5, 2015, is a holder of membership units of SOK Partners. 

In connection with the Unit Exchange that was consummated on
August 31, 2015, 250 shares of Series A Convertible Stock held by Mr. Kornberg were exchanged for 2,778 Exchange Units. 

Note 9   RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN  

We have a pre-tax salary reduction/profit-sharing plan under
the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we matched 100%, of the employee s contribution up to 4% of their earnings. The employer contribution
was $7,401 and $28,196 for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 and was $7,021 and $21,735 for the three and nine
months ending September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Note 10   SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DATA

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

Overview  

We were incorporated in Minnesota in April 2002 under the name
BioDrain Medical, Inc. Effective August 6, 2013, the Company changed its name to Skyline Medical Inc. Pursuant to an Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated effective December 16, 2013, the Company merged with and into a Delaware corporation with the same name
that was its wholly-owned subsidiary, with such Delaware corporation as the surviving corporation of the merger. We are a development
stage company manufacturing an environmentally conscientious system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids that result
from surgical procedures and post-operative care.   Since our inception in 2002, we have invested significant resources
into product development.  We believe that our success depends upon converting the traditional process of collecting
and disposing of infectious fluids from the operating rooms of medical facilities to our wall-mounted Fluid Management System ( FMS )
and use of our proprietary cleaning fluid and filter kit. 

We currently have one regional sales manager to sell the STREAMWAY
FMS, and have recently hired a new Vice President of Sales to build our sales and marketing infrastructure. In 2014 we signed a
contract with an independent distributor covering New York and surrounding areas as well as, three other independent contracting
groups handling parts of the Midwest, the Southeast and Oklahoma. In 2016, we signed a contract with a large independent distributor
covering Georgia and South Carolina. We also signed a reseller agreement granting Munro Enterprises LLC certain exclusive rights
to market and distribute the STREAMWAY FMS to the U.S. federal government including U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Department
of Defense and U.S. Health and Human Services facilities, among others. Munro Enterprises LLC is an Economically-Disadvantaged,
Woman-Owned Small Business.   

Since inception, we have been unprofitable. We incurred net
losses of approximately $1.1 million and $5.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $1.1 million
and $2.5 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $46.3 million and $38.2 million, respectively. We received approval from
the FDA in April 2009 to commence sales and marketing activities of the STREAMWAY FMS and shipped the first system in 2009. However,
there was no significant revenue prior to 2011, primarily due to lack of funds to build and ship the product. 

In the first quarter of 2014, the Company commenced sales of
an updated version of the STREAMWAY FMS, which provides a number of enhancements to the existing product line including a more
intuitive and easier to navigate control screen, data storage capabilities, and additional inlet ports on the filters, among other
improvements. This updated version utilizes improved technology, including the capability for continuous flow and continuous suctioning,
as covered by our provisional patent application filed in 2013 and our non-provisional patent application filed in January 2014.
We sold ninety-six STREAMWAY FMS units to date. 

We expect the revenue for STREAMWAY FMS units to increase significantly
at such time as the hospitals approve the use of the units for their applications and place orders for billable units. We also
expect an increase in trial based units. Trial basis units are either installed in or hung on the hospital room wall. The unit
is connected to the hospital plumbing and sewer systems, as well as, the hospital vacuum system. The unit remains on the customer
site for 2   4 weeks, as contracted, at no cost to the customer. However, the customer does purchase the disposable products
(cleaning fluid and filters) necessary to effectively operate the units. Once the trial period has expired the unit is either returned
to the Company or purchased by the customer. If purchased, at that time, the Company invoices the customer based upon a contracted
price negotiated prior to the trial. 

We have never generated sufficient revenues to fund our capital
requirements. We have funded our operations through a variety of debt and equity instruments. In 2014 we completed private placements
of Series A Preferred Stock and convertible notes raising aggregate gross proceeds of $3,530,000. In September 2014, we commenced
a public offering that was delayed, and we did not complete our public offering until August 2015. During that period of time,
due to limited funding and continued operating losses, we curtailed our operations and delayed our expenditures to stay in operation.
These factors negatively affected our sales in late 2014 and the full year 2015. In August 2015, we completed a public unit offering
for $13,555,003, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses Our future cash requirements and the adequacy
of available funds depend on our ability to sell our products and the availability of future financing to fulfill our business
plans. See  Plan of Financing; Going Concern Qualification  below. 

Our limited history of operations makes prediction of future
operating results difficult. We believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied on as predictive
of our future results. 

Recent Developments  

On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into a letter of intent to form a joint venture
with Electronic On-Ramp, Inc. ( EOR ). EOR s partner contracts with government agencies are expected to provide
the Company with access to bid on procurement contracts for up to $550 million or more in federal funds budgeted for health, security,
life safety-systems support, humanitarian assistance and disaster preparedness. 

At a special meeting of stockholders held on September 15, 2016, the Company s
stockholders (i) approved an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 and (ii) approved an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation
to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares to its common stock within certain limits. On September 16, 2016, the
Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect the increase in the authorized capital stock.
On October 26, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock
split of the outstanding shares of its common stock at a ratio of one-for-twenty-five (1:25), and a proportionate decrease of the
authorized common stock from 200,000,000 shares to 8,000,000 shares. The reverse stock split took effect at 5:00 p.m. New York
time on October 27, 2016, and the Company s common stock commenced trading on a post-split basis on October 28, 2016. 

On September 20, 2016, the Company entered into a partnership and exclusive reseller
agreement with GLG Pharma ( GLG ). Under the terms of the agreement, GLG intends to develop rapid diagnostic tests
that utilize fluid and tissue collected by the STREAMWAY System during procedures. The Company will issue an aggregate of 400,000
shares common stock to GLG in four separate tranches of 100,000 shares of common stock in each tranche. The shares reserved in
each tranche will be released after the achievement of certain development milestones designated in the agreement. In addition,
the Company will pay a royalty to GLG on the sale of individual tests. 

On October 11, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department
(the  Staff ) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq ), indicating that the staff had determined to delist
the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market due to the Company s continued non-compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement as of October 10, 2016, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the
 Panel ). The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which request stayed any delisting or suspension
action by the Staff pending the issuance of the Panel s decision and the expiration of any extension granted by the Panel.
At the hearing, the Company intends to present its plan to address compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as well as
the minimum stockholders  equity requirement and to request the continued listing of its securities on The Nasdaq Capital
Market, pursuant to an extension if necessary. There can be no assurance that the Panel will determine to continue the Company s
listing or that the Company will be able to demonstrate compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time
that may be granted by the Panel. 

Effective October 27, 2016, the board of directors of the Company appointed J. Melville ( Mel )
Engle and Timothy A. Krochuk to serve as directors of the Company. These appointments increase the number of directors to five. 

Results of Operations  

On October 27, 2016, the Company effected a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of its common
stock. All share information in the financial statements for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of the reverse stock
split. 

Revenue.  The Company recognized $135,000 of revenue in
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $86,000 in revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company
recognized $317,000 of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $471,000 in revenue in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.There have been two sales of the STREAMWAY unit in 2016, both in the third quarter. Our sales efforts were curtailed
in late 2015 and early 2016 due to our concentrated efforts on customer management. We have hired a Vice President of Sales who
has implemented a nine point program focusing on gaining market presence and brand awareness. The Vice President of Sales is rebuilding
the infrastructure of our sales team and we expect a positive impact on future sales. 

Cost of sales.  Cost of sales was $26,000 in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and $20,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales was $149,000 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and $199,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The gross profit margin was approximately
53% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 58% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We expect our margins
to increase over the next several quarters as our manufacturing production becomes more consistent, and as increased sales allow
us to achieve volume purchasing discounts on both equipment components and our cleaning solution. Over the next several quarters,
we expect increases in revenues to exceed increases in costs related to increasing manufacturing and sales capabilities. 

General and Administrative expense.  General and administrative
expense primarily consists of management salaries, professional fees, consulting fees, travel expense, administrative fees and
general office expenses. 

General and Administrative (G A) expenses decreased by $128,000
from the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015. G A expenses increased by $3,095,000 from the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015. For the three month period ending September 30, 2016 payroll,
bonuses, payroll taxes, benefits, travel and automobile leases decreased by $133,000 due to the CEO resignation and zero dollar
compensation for the current Executive Chairman; license fees and payroll tax penalty and interest were also reduced by $38,000.
Another reduction resulted from zero expenses for convertible notes in 2016 versus $475,000 in such expenses in 2015. Investor
relations, stock based compensation and investor s stock compensation were offsets that increased by $319,000. A further
offset was a $220,000 increase in legal expenses in 2016 as a result of large credits issued in 2015. The nine month increase was
affected by severance pay increasing $1,018,000 due to the negotiated settlement with the former CEO. Investors stock compensation
and investor relations increased by $1,689,000 due to the new investment banker and the exercise of cashless warrants as a result
of the separation of the Units in February 2016. Legal fees increased by $723,000 in 2016 due to the Unit Exchange Offer, the Exchange
Offer, negotiations with our former CEO and as a result of large credits issued in the third quarter of 2015. Recruiting fees increased
by $107,000 due to hiring the new Vice President of Sales. Offsets include: convertible note expense reductions for $475,000, stock
based compensation of $116,000, tax and penalties of $143,000 and payroll expenses of $191,000. 

Operations expense.  Operations expense primarily consists
of expenses related to product development and prototyping and testing in the Company s current stage. 

Operations expense increased by $90,000 in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The three month increase was due to increased salaries
of $24,000 for new engineer and quality control positions; additional consulting expenses of $52,000 to assist in our STREAMWAY
software upgrades; employee stock options to retain employees with a value of $47,000 to stock based compensation, and by $21,000
for research and development. Offsets were from decreases to bonuses in 2016 of $43,000 and to reduced miscellaneous expenses of
$13,000. Operations expense increased by $553,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The nine month increase was due to $94,000 in increased salaries, taxes and benefits for the two new positions
mentioned above; $206,000 in bonuses as a result of the 2015 reversal of bonus accruals as waived by officers and the additional
bonus in 2016 resulting from options exercised; employee stock options to retain employees with a value of $47,000 to stock based
compensation; $66,000 in consulting expenses for the STREAMWAY software upgrades and $123,000 for research and development expenses. 

Sales and Marketing expense.  Sales and marketing expense
consists of expenses required to sell products through independent reps, attendance at trades shows, product literature and other
sales and marketing activities .  

Sales and marketing expenses increased by $71,000 in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The three month increase was due to $71,000
in bonuses negated in the 2015 quarter (there were no bonuses in 2016); $15,000 in value for employee options recorded to stock
based compensation; $23,000 in increased commissions; $7,000 in increased travel expenses with the addition of the Vice President
of Sales to our staff and enhanced sales programs; and $18,000 for increased advertising and trade show participation. Partially
offsetting the increases were reduced salaries of $64,000 due to the reduction of our sales staff in 2015. Sales expense decreased
by $91,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The nine month decrease
was due to $207,000 reduction in salaries, payroll taxes and benefits; $9,000 in commissions; and $20,000 in reduced stock based
compensation all due to a reduced sales staff in 2016. These increases were partially offset due to $68,000 in increased advertising
and trade show participation, $45,000 in increased consulting expenses as we seek to increase our government sales, $7,000 in increased
travel due to the addition of our Vice President of Sales and the enhanced sales programs instituted, and $15,000 as result of
reversed bonuses in 2015. 

Interest expense.  Interest decreased by $52,000 in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and by $395,000 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as there was no outstanding debt during this period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flows   

Net cash used in operating activities was $3,704,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared with net cash used of $4,637,000 for the 2015 period. The $933,000 decrease in cash used in operating activities
was primarily due to the issuance of common stock in cashless warrant exchanges and equity instruments issued for consulting as
a result of hiring an investment banking firm and as a result of large payments to accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2015
after the public offering. There was an offset due to the increased net loss of 3,266,000. 

Cash flows used in investing activities was $604,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and $23,800 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company invested in marketable securities. There was
a moderate increase to purchases in fixed assets and minimal fees related to patents. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $86,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided of $12,378,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer exercised options in 2016, and there was a public offering in 2015
that resulted in $13 million net brought into the Company. 

Capital Resources   

We had a cash balance of $634,000 as of September 30, 2016.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$46,300,000. 

From inception to September 30, 2016, our operations have been
funded through a bank loan and private convertible debt of approximately $5,685,000 and equity investments totaling approximately
$22,325,000. 

In the first nine months of 2016, we recognized $317,000 in revenues. Our product sales
since the end of the third quarter have resulted in approximately $33,000 in revenues. 

Payment Obligations Under Separation Agreement With Former CEO   

Effective May 5, 2016, Joshua Kornberg resigned as the Chief Executive Officer and President
and an employee of the Company. In connection with Mr. Kornberg s resignation, the Company and Mr. Kornberg entered into
a separation agreement on June 13, 2016 (the  Separation Agreement ). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, on July
15, 2016, the Company was required to pay Mr. Kornberg: (a) $15,443.20 less any required tax withholdings in a lump sum on July
15, 2016; and (b) $75,000 less any required tax withholdings on July 15, 2016. The Company is required to pay Mr. Kornberg an
additional $75,000 less any required tax withholdings payable in 6 monthly installments of $12,500, due on the first regular payday
of each month, starting on August 15, 2016; and (d) an additional $450,000 less any required tax withholdings payable in 11 monthly
installments of $40,909, due on the first regular payday of each month, starting on February 15, 2017. The Company issued to Mr.
Kornberg a restricted stock award (the  Award ) under the Company s stock incentive plan consisting of 20,000
shares. The Award vested on July 15, 2016. The value of the Award for purposes of the Separation Agreement (the  Award Value )
is $90,350.61, based on a ten day volume-weighted average closing sale price per share of the Company s common stock. Mr.
Kornberg agreed that the withholding taxes in connection with the Award will be offset against cash payments otherwise due to
him in four monthly installments. In addition, the Company agreed to, at its option, either (a) pay Mr. Kornberg $309,649.39 (the
 Additional Cash Amount ), equal to the difference between $400,000 and the Award Value, payable in equal monthly
installments of $40,909, due on the first regular payday of each month, starting on January 15, 2018, less any required tax withholding,
or (b) issue to Mr. Kornberg shares of common stock of the Company (the  Additional Shares ) on January 15, 2018 with
an aggregate fair market equal to the Additional Cash Amount, based on a ten day volume-weighted average closing sale price per
share. Under the Separation Agreement, all of Mr. Kornberg s outstanding stock options and outstanding restricted stock
prior to the date of the Separation Agreement were canceled, consisting of options to purchase 22,085 shares and 2,667 shares
of restricted stock. The Separation Agreement included a waiver and release of claims by Mr. Kornberg. He will also continue to
be bound by the terms of any restrictive covenant agreements he had with the Company. 

The foregoing summary of the Separation Agreement does not purport to be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Separation Agreement, a copy of which was filed on June 17, 2016 as an exhibit
to our Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Plan of Financing; Going Concern Qualification   

Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses, and
our accumulated deficit was approximately $46.3 million as of September 30, 2016. Our operations from inception have been funded
with private placements of convertible debt securities and equity securities, in addition to a past bank loan (not currently outstanding)
and a qualified public offering raising a net $13,555,003, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses. We
currently have no outstanding bank debt and no secured indebtedness. 

We have not achieved profitability and anticipate that we will
continue to incur net losses at least through fiscal 2016. 

We had revenues of $317,000 in 2016, but we had negative operating
cash flows of $3.7 million. In August 2015, we received proceeds of $13.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions
and expenses, as a result of our public offering. During the first quarter of 2016 and the remainder of 2015, we paid $10.2 million
in cash to cover accrued debts and obligations, most of which were required to be paid upon completion of the offering or were
considered past due. Additionally, we have covered our monthly operating expenses, research and development costs and expanded
effort in sales and marketing including the successful search for our newly hired Vice President of Sales. Our cash balance was
$0.6 million as of September 30, 2016, and our accounts payable and accrued expenses were an aggregate $2.0 million. We have reduced
our monthly negative cash flow to approximately $350,000 beginning in June 2016. Although we are attempting to curtail our expenses,
there is no guarantee that we will be able to reduce these expenses significantly, and expenses for some periods may be higher
as we prepare our product for broader sales efforts and maintain adequate inventories. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no debt. We will require
additional funding to finance operating expenses and to invest in our sales organization and new product development and to enter
the international marketplace. We will attempt to raise these funds through equity or debt financing, alternative offerings or
other means. If we are successful in securing adequate funding we plan to make significant capital or equipment investments, and
we will also continue to make human resource additions over the next 12 months. Such additional financing will be dilutive to existing
stockholders, and there is no assurance that such financing will be available upon acceptable terms. If such financing or adequate
funds from operations are not available, we will be forced to limit our business activities, which will have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

As a result of the above factors, our independent registered
public accounting firm has indicated in their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements included in our annual report
on Form 10-K, that they have serious doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. 

Terminated Exchange offer for Units  

In January 2016 we commenced a registered offer (the  Unit
Exchange Offer ) to exchange, on a one-for-one basis, new units in exchange for the 1,895,010 outstanding units (the  Units )
that were issued in our August 2015 public offering and a concurrent issuance of Units in exchange for previously outstanding Series
A Preferred Stock. Each new unit, if issued, would have consisted of shares of common stock and certain warrants to purchase common
stock. On March 2, 2016, we announced the termination of the Exchange Offer. None of the Units were accepted for exchange in the
Unit Exchange Offer. 

Exchange Offer for Series A Warrants  

On March 25, 2016, the Company commenced a registered exchange offer (the  Exchange
Offer ) to exchange Series B Warrants (the  Series B Warrants  to purchase shares of our common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the  Warrant Shares ), for up to an aggregate of 3,157,186 outstanding Series A Warrants (the  Series
A Warrants ). On March 31, 2016, each Series A Warrant could be exercised on a cashless basis for .40 shares of common stock. 

For each outstanding Series A Warrant tendered by holders, we offered to issue .40 Series
B Warrants, which are subject to cashless exercise at a fixed rate of one share of common stock per Series B Warrant (subject to
further adjustment for stock splits, etc.). 

The Exchange Offer expired at midnight, Eastern time, on April 21, 2016. 1,770,556 Series
A Warrants to purchase 722,387 shares of the Company s common stock were tendered by holders of Series A Warrants. On April
25, 2016, the Company delivered an aggregate of 18,059,671 Series B Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer. 

Additional Exercise of Warrants  

In addition, between March 31, 2016 and July 6, 2016, 1,251,510 Series A Warrants were
exercised in cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 20,121 shares of common stock. 

Inflation  

We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on
our business and operating results during the periods presented. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined
in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Recent Accounting
Developments  

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations are based upon our audited Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements,
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented, as well as our disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited
to, fair value of stock-based compensation, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets
and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. 

We base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience.
We also used any other pertinent information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made.  We
believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for our making judgments
about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results
and outcomes could differ from our estimates. 

Our significant accounting policies are described in  Note
1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  in Notes to Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and reflects those areas that require
more significant judgments, and use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our Financial Statements. 

Revenue Recognition.    We recognize revenue
in accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 Revenue Recognition and ASC 605   Revenue Recognition. 

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. Delivery is considered to have
occurred upon either shipment of the product or arrival at its destination based on the shipping terms of the transaction. Our
standard terms specify that shipment is FOB Skyline and we will, therefore, recognize revenue upon shipment in most cases. This
revenue recognition policy applies to shipments of our STREAMWAY FMS units as well as shipments of cleaning solution and filter
consumables. When these conditions are satisfied, we recognize gross product revenue, which is the price we charge generally to
our customers for a particular product. Under our standard terms and conditions, there is no provision for installation or
acceptance of the product to take place prior to the obligation of the customer. The customer s right of return is limited
only to our standard one-year warranty, whereby we replace or repair, at our option. We believe it would be rare that the
STREAMWAY FMS unit or significant quantities of cleaning solution and filter consumables may be returned. Additionally, since we
buy both the STREAMWAY FMS units and cleaning solution and filter consumables from  turnkey  suppliers, we would have
the right to replacements from the suppliers if this situation should occur. 

Stock-Based Compensation .   Effective January
1, 2006, we adopted ASC 718- Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ).  Under ASC 718 stock-based employee
compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all new awards granted after January 1, 2006 and unvested
awards outstanding at January 1, 2006. Compensation costs for unvested stock options and non-vested awards that were outstanding
at January 1, 2006, are being recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of those options
and awards, using a straight-line method. We elected the modified-prospective method in adopting ASC 718 under which prior periods
are not retroactively restated. 

ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock-based
payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires
the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees and directors will retain vested
stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, the number of
options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements and the risk-free interest rate. 

When an option or warrant is granted in place of cash compensation
for services, we deem the value of the service rendered to be the value of the option or warrant.  In most cases, however,
an option or warrant is granted in addition to other forms of compensation and its separate value is difficult to determine without
utilizing an option pricing model.  For that reason we also use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value options and
warrants granted to non-employees, which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period that
investors or consultants will retain vested stock options and warrants before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our
common stock price over the expected term, the number of options and warrants that will ultimately be forfeited before completing
vesting requirements and the risk-free interest rate.  Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate
of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognizes that. Since we have no trading history
in our common stock and no first-hand experience with how our investors and consultants have acted in similar circumstances, the
assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.  As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions,
our equity-based consulting and interest expense could be materially different in the future. 

Since our common stock has no significant public trading history
we were required to take an alternative approach to estimating future volatility and the future results could vary significantly
from our estimates.  We compiled historical volatilities over a period of 2 to 7 years of 10 small-cap medical companies traded
on major exchanges and 15 medical companies in the middle of the market cap size range on the OTC Bulletin Board and combined the
results using a weighted average approach.  In the case of standard options to employees we determined the expected life to
be the midpoint between the vesting term and the legal term.  In the case of options or warrants granted to non-employees,
we estimated the life to be the legal term unless there was a compelling reason to make it shorter.   

Valuation of Intangible Assets     

We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance
with ASC 350-  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other,  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. Our intangible assets are currently solely the costs of obtaining trademarks and patents. 
Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a
significant change in the medical device marketplace and a significant adverse change in the business climate in which we operate.
If such events or changes in circumstances are present, the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the intangible
asset is impaired. Cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges. If the
carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset, the asset is considered
impaired, and the impairment is measured by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value using the discounted cash
flows method. The discount rate utilized is based on management's best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the
impairment assessment is made. The Company wrote off the entire original STREAMWAY FMS product patent of $140,588 in June 2013.
The balance represented intellectual property in the form of patents for our original STREAMWAY FMS product. The Company's enhanced
STREAMWAY FMS product has a new patent pending, see  Patents and Intellectual Property. . 

Recent Accounting Developments  

See Note 1 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
to the Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting developments. 

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

This Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements 
that indicate certain risks and uncertainties related to the Company, many of which are beyond the Company s control. The
Company s actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements
as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report. Important factors that may cause
actual results to differ from projections include: 

Inability to raise sufficient additional capital to operate our business;  

Terms of any future financing, which may be highly dilutive and may include onerous terms;  

Unexpected costs and operating deficits, and lower than expected sales and revenues, if any;  

Potential delisting of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with adverse effects
        on liquidity and coverage of our common stock;  

No assurance of timely development of technologies by GLG Pharma, or of ability to consummate
        our joint venture with Electronic On-Ramp, Inc.  

Adverse economic conditions;   

Adverse results of any legal proceedings;   

The volatility of our operating results and financial condition;   

Inability to attract or retain qualified senior management personnel, including sales and marketing personnel; and   

Other specific risks that may be alluded to in this report.   

All statements other than statements of historical facts, included
in this report regarding the Company s growth strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenue or losses,
projected costs, prospects and plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the
words  will ,  may ,  believe ,  anticipate ,  intend ,  estimate ,
 expect ,  project ,  plan  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. All forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date of this report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other
information contained herein. Potential investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although
Skyline believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this
report are reasonable the Company cannot assure potential investors that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved.
The Company discloses important factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from its expectations
in the  Risk Factors  section and elsewhere our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These
cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf. 

Information regarding market and industry statistics contained
in this report is included based on information available to the Company that it believes is accurate. It is generally based on
academic and other publications that are not produced for purposes of securities offerings or economic analysis. The Company has
not reviewed or included data from all sources, and the Company cannot assure potential investors of the accuracy or completeness
of the data included in this report. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to
the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties accompanying any estimates of future market size, revenue and market acceptance
of products and services. The Company has no obligation to update forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes
in assumptions or other factors that could affect those statements. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

Not required. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in  Internal Control-Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. 

With the participation of the Interim Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the three months ended September 30,
2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings  

None. 

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information set forth in the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the reader should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes in
the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 with the exception of the amendment and replacement of the first risk factor below and
the addition of the second risk factor below.  

We will require additional financing to finance operating
expenses and fulfill our business plan. Such financing will be dilutive. Our independent public accounting firm has indicated in
their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements, that they have serious doubts about our ability to remain a going concern.   

We had revenues of $317,000 in the quarters ended September
30, 2016, but we had negative operating cash flows of $3.7 million in those quarters. In August 2015, we received proceeds of $13.5
million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, as a result of our public offering. During the first
quarter 2016 and the remainder of 2015, we paid $10.2 million in cash to cover accrued debts and obligations, most of which were
required to be paid upon completion of the offering or were considered past due. Additionally, we have covered our monthly operating
expenses, research and development costs and expanded effort in sales and marketing including the successful search for our newly
hired Vice President of Sales. Our cash balance was $0.6 million as of September 30, 2016, and our accounts payable and accrued
expenses were an aggregate $2.0 million. We expect our monthly negative cash flow to reduce to approximately $350,000 beginning
in June 2016. Although we are attempting to curtail our expenses, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reduce these expenses
significantly, and expenses for some periods may be higher as we prepare our product for broader sales efforts and maintain adequate
inventories. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no debt. We will require
additional funding to finance operating expenses and to invest in our sales organization and new product development and to enter
the international marketplace. We will attempt to raise these funds through equity or debt financing, alternative offerings or
other means. If we are successful in securing adequate funding we plan to make significant capital or equipment investments, and
we will also continue to make human resource additions over the next 12 months. Such additional financing will be dilutive to existing
stockholders, and there is no assurance that such financing will be available upon acceptable terms. If such financing or adequate
funds from operations are not available, we will be forced to limit our business activities, which will have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

As a result of the above factors, our independent registered
public accounting firm has indicated in their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements included in our annual report
on Form 10-K filed on March 16, 2016, that they have serious doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. See  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

Our common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital
Market, which delisting could hinder your ability to obtain accurate quotations on the price of our common stock, or dispose of
our common stock in the secondary market.    

In order to maintain our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market,
our common stock must sustain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share and we must satisfy the other requirements for continued
listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. On October 11, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department
(the  Staff ) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq ), indicating that the Staff had determined to delist
the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market due to the Company s continued non-compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement as of October 10, 2016, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the
 Panel ). The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which request stayed any delisting or suspension
action by the Staff pending the issuance of the Panel s decision and the expiration of any extension granted by the Panel.
At the hearing, the Company intends to present its plan to address compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as well as
the minimum stockholders  equity requirement and to request the continued listing of its securities on The Nasdaq Capital
Market, pursuant to an extension if necessary. There can be no assurance that the Panel will determine to continue the Company s
listing or that the Company will be able to demonstrate compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time
that may be granted by the Panel. 

In the event our common stock is delisted from The NASDAQ Capital
Market and we are also unable to maintain listing on another alternate exchange, trading in our common stock could thereafter be
conducted in FINRA s OTC Bulletin Board or in the over-the-counter markets in the so-called pink sheets. In such event, the
liquidity of our common stock would likely be impaired, not only in the number of shares which could be bought and sold, but also
through delays in the timing of the transactions, and there would likely be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and
the news media, thereby resulting in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise prevail. 

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds  

On July 1, 2016, the Company issued inducement stock options
in accordance with NASDAQ listing rules for 40,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01, at $3.75 per share to the Company s
newly hired Vice President of Sales. The options will vest in six equal increments: on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth
and sixth quarters of the hiring date anniversary. The options were granted outside of the Company's stock incentive plan but are
subject to terms and conditions generally consistent with the plan.The issuance of these inducement options were made pursuant
to the exemption set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended for transactions not involving a public offering,
and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

On October 4, 2016, the Company issued 400,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01, to be held in escrow in connection with the Company s Partnership and Exclusive Reseller Agreement
with GLG Pharma, LLC. For this issuance, the Company relied on the exemption from federal registration under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act or 1933 and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, based on the Company s belief that the offer and sale of the
shares did not involve a public offering. 

ITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

None. 

ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

Not applicable.

1.  
      I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Skyline Medical Inc.;   

2.  
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
