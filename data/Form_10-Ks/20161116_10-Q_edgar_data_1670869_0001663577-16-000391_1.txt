  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

  For the Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

NOTE 1   General  

Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. ( RMHB 
or the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. On July 17, 2014, the Company changed its
name from Republic of Texas Brands Incorporated to Totally Hemp Crazy, Inc. and on October 23, 2015, the Company changed its name
to Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. 

On June 30, 2016 the Company entered into a business
alliance with Poafpybitty Family, LLC and formed Rocky Mountain High Water Company LLC ( RMHW ). The Company has a
non-controlling interest in RMHW and accounts for its investment in RMHW on the equity method. In connection with this business
alliance, the Company formed Eagle Spirit Land   Water Company ( ESLW ) effective June 30, 2016. ESLW is a wholly-owned
consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 

RMHB has developed and is currently
selling in the marketplace a lineup of five hemp-infused beverages, hemp-infused 2oz. energy shots, and hemp-infused relaxation
brownies through its nationwide distributor network and online.  Effective June 30, 2016, the Company entered into a business
alliance with Poafpybitty Family, LLC to launch Eagle Spirit Spring Water, a line of purified, high-alkaline spring water sourced
from Native American tribal land in Oklahoma. The Company also plans to launch a hemp-infused Energy Bar, Protein Bar and Chia
Crisp Bar. 

NOTE 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim
financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s
management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only
of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on October 4, 2016. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain of the Company s estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique
to its industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on the Company s
estimates that could cause actual results to differ from its estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates
at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary. 

Investments
in non-consolidated subsidiaries   

Investments
in non-consolidated entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and/or
the Company's ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When the equity
method is used, investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company's proportionate share
of the investees' net income or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from an investment accounted for under the
equity method exceed its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not provided for.
The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently reports net income and the
Company's share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended.
Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred.  

Cash   

The Company considers all short-term
highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Revenue Recognition  

The Company follows the guidance of
the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  It records revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable
and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. The Company has not experienced any significant returns from customers
and accordingly, in management s opinion, no reserve for returns has been provided. Payments received prior to shipment of
goods are recorded as deferred revenue. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Receivable  

The Company has a policy of reserving
for uncollectible accounts based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable.
We extend credit to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. The Company generally does
not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable and perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and
maintain an allowance for potential bad debts if required. 

It is determined whether an allowance
for doubtful accounts is required by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability
to meet financial obligations. In these cases, we use assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances,
to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected.
These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. The amounts calculated are analyzed
to determine the total amount of the allowance. The Company may also record a general allowance as necessary. 

Direct write-offs are taken in the period
when we have exhausted our efforts to collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate other circumstances that indicate
the collectability of receivables. 

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
2016, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $60,163 and $60,163, respectively. 

Inventory  

Inventory, which consists of the Company s
raw materials, packaging, and finished products held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in,
first-out, and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price, in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs to dispose of the product. 

If the Company identifies excess, obsolete
or unsalable items, its inventory is written down to the net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified.
Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of sales in the Company s
statements of operations. 

Fair Value Measurements  

The Company adopted the provisions of
ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 

The estimated fair value of certain
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried
at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying
amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations,
which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded
conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. 

Table of Contents     

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1   quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2   quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable. 

 Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example
cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions). 

The derivative liability in connection
with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a Level 3 liability, is the only financial liability measure
at fair value on a recurring basis. 

The change in the Level 3 financial
instrument is as follows: 

The estimated fair value of the derivative
instruments were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following assumptions as of September 30, 2016: 

Estimated Dividends  
      None   
 
      Expected Volatility  
      2.0%   
 
      Risk Free Interest Rate  
      .59%   
 
      Expected Term  
      .1 to 1.0 years   

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment is stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company evaluates intangible assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The
Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow and recognizes an impairment loss
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset plus the net proceeds expected from
disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When the Company identifies an impairment, it
reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available
and appropriate, to comparable market values.  No impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. 

Table of Contents     

Share-based Payments  

Share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values,
in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide
services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company had no common
stock options or common stock equivalents granted or outstanding for all periods presented. 

The Company issued restricted stock
to consultants and employees for various services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the common stock
is to be measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity
instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete. 

Convertible Instruments  

The Company evaluates and accounts for
conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
Applicable GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as freestanding
derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics
and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host
contract is not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. 

Preferred Stock  

We apply the guidance enumerated in
ASC 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  when determining the classification and measurement of preferred stock.
Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value.
We classify conditionally redeemable preferred shares (if any), which includes preferred shares that feature redemption rights
that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control, as temporary equity. At all other times, we classified our preferred shares in stockholders  equity. Our preferred
shares do not feature any redemption rights within the holders  control or conditional redemption features not within our
control. Accordingly all issuances of preferred stock are presented as a component of consolidated shareholders  deficit. 

Advertising  

Advertising and marketing expenses are
charged to operations as incurred. 

Income Taxes  

The Company uses the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax
expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences
of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it
is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 3   Going Concern  

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. The Company has a shareholders  deficit of $1,739,907 and an accumulated deficit of $17,608,659
as of September 30, 2016, and has generated operating losses since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to generate revenues and its ability to continue raising capital from third parties. 

On September 9, 2016, the
Company, its controlling shareholder, and an outside investor group executed a letter of intent granting the investor group
the option to purchase 100% of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock, which represents a controlling interest in the
Company. The agreement between the parties requires that the investors provide the Company sufficient capital to move forward
with its expansion plans. The acquisition is expected to close on or before December 31, 2016. 

NOTE 4   Inventory  

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, inventory consisted
of the following: 

NOTE 5   Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets  

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, prepaid expenses
and other current assets were as follows:

NOTE 6   Property and Equipment  

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, property and
equipment were as follows: 

NOTE 7   Investments  

Dollar Shots Club  

On September 18, 2015, the Company,
through a series of transactions acquired 5,000,000 shares of Dollar Shots Club, Inc. ( DSC ) in exchange for 2,000,000
shares of common stock. The shares of DSC are being carried on the accompanying balance sheet based on the shares of stock given
in exchange for the investment. The Company is accounting for the investment on the cost basis of accounting being that the shares
represent approximately 5% of the total outstanding shares of DSC and the Company does not have any significant influence in DSC.
The investment in DSC was fully impaired as of June 30, 2016. 

Rocky Mountain High
Water Company LLC  

 In July 2016, the Company entered
into a business alliance with Poafpybitty Family, LLC to launch Eagle Spirit Spring Water, a line of purified, high-alkaline spring
water sourced from Native American tribal land in Oklahoma. The agreement calls for the Company to pay a royalty on each gallon
of water collected at the spring. Production of filtered spring water filled bottles commenced in August 2016 and sales began in
October 2016. 

 In consideration for the 20-year water
and surface rights, and a related 10-year renewal option, the Company paid Poafpybitty Family, LLC cash payments of $22,500 and
issued a warrant for 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock exercisable at $.03 per share over a three-year period
beginning July 27, 2016. 

The agreement grants the Company an
exclusive right to develop land adjacent to the spring for commercial purposes as agreed to by both parties. Additionally, the
Company has agreed to grow hemp for experimental or commercial purposes on the land within three years.

Incorporation as of March 21, 2016 to create the Series D Preferred stock class, a non-voting, non-interest bearing convertible
preferred stock. Each Series C preferred share is convertible to 100 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, there are
no Series D preferred shares outstanding. 

Warrants   

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 the Company granted 5,850,000 common stock warrants and 35,338,704 were exercised. In the three months ended September

NOTE 12  Concentrations  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company s two largest customers accounted for approximately 81% and 3% of sales, respectively. During the three
months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s two largest customers accounted for approximately 37% and 21% of sales, respectively.   

NOTE 13     Income Taxes  

The reconciliation of income tax benefit
at the U.S. statutory rate of 34% to the Company s effective rate for the periods presented is as follows: 

The tax effects of temporary differences
that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax liability as of September 30 and June 30, 2016 are as follows:    

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had approximately $8,500,000 of federal and state net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs ), which begin to expire in 2027.
Utilization of the NOLs may be subject to limitation under the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 should there be a greater than
50% ownership change as determined under regulations. 

In assessing the realization of deferred
tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has
established a full valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more
likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

RMHB
is a consumer goods brand development company specializing in developing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing high quality,
health conscious, hemp-infused food and beverage products and spring water. The Company currently markets a lineup of five hemp-infused
beverages. RMHB is also researching the development of a lineup of products containing Cannabidiol (CBD). The Company s
intention is to be on the cutting edge of the use of CBD in consumer products while complying with all state and federal laws
and regulations. See New Product Pipeline below.  

After
developing the beverage products, RMHB completed its first production run in February of 2015. Since then RMHB has had production
runs for hemp-infused beverages totaling over 3,700,000 cans. Each beverage contains approximately 100mg of hempseed extract,
and all of the non-alcoholic beverages will consist of all-natural ingredients. The non-alcoholic products are shelf stable (no
refrigeration necessary) with a shelf life of two (2) years. The Wine Based Ready-to-Drink Cocktails contain 12.5% alcohol and
are packaged in 375ml, 750ml and 1.5 liter PET bottles. These alcoholic beverages are also shelf stable (no refrigeration necessary)
and have a shelf life of 18 months. Packaging for our line-up of products containing cannabinoids (CBD) will be determined at
a later date.  

The
Company has also run its first production run of both Energy Shots and Relaxation Brownies. In addition, in August, the Company
bottled its first high alkaline spring water, Eagle Spirit Spring Water.

The
Company recently executed a one-year agreement with MBA Beverage to coordinate the manufacturing of our products. MBA Beverage
acts as our outsourced supply-chain management and coordinates every aspect of the manufacturing process. MBA Beverage also purchases
all ingredients that are used in the manufacturing process since it has established relationships with all suppliers. MBA Beverage
purchases hemp from Global Essence, Global Essence provides MBA Beverage independent third party testing documentation that all
hemp used in our manufacturing process is THC free.  

Blues
    City Brewery, LLC ( Blues City ) in Memphis, Tennessee, a subsidiary of City Brewing Company, LLC, manufactures
    and bottles our products. Blues City is an FDA registered facility that is audited annually to ensure compliance with FDA
    GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) for food safety. MBA Beverage schedules beverage production with Blues City. The Company
    does not contract with Blues City directly. A copy of the MBA Beverage contract is included as an exhibit to this filing.   

Sovereign
    Flavors of Santa Ana, California collaborates with the Company for product formulation under an oral agreement. The Company
    owns the propriety formulas to our products.   

Upstart
    Foods Marketing of St. Louis, Missouri and Advertising Arts of Brookfield, Wisconsin provide the packaging design. Once any
    packing design (label) is approved, Ball Metal Beverage Container Corporation or Rexam Beverage Can Company manufactures the
    cans. Upon completion, the cans are shipped to Blues City. Payments are made in advance to MBA Beverage. MBA Beverage, in
    turn, makes payments in advance at both manufacturing plants. There are no written contracts, other than with MBA Beverage
    and Upstart Food Marketing

The
CBD beverage line is in pre-development stage. Any CBD beverages will be THC-free. Therefore, these products will be 100% legal
in all 50 states. Products containing Cannabidiol (CBD) can be a source of essential fatty acids, vitamin E, and trace minerals
in addition to containing high amounts of protein. CBD is extracted and separated from specific varieties of cannabis, often known
as hemp. Chemically, CBD is one of 85 chemical substances known as cannabinoids, which are all found in the cannabis plant.
CBD is the second most abundant compound in hemp, typically representing up to 40% of its extracts. CBD is actually unrelated
to the chemical chain that results in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). They share some characteristics but are created via different
paths. The chemical properties of CBD and THC vary widely enough to classify THC as a psychotropic drug strictly controlled by
federal authorities, while CBD is considered a legal dietary supplement.  

The
Company will seek an independent legal opinion to ensure that it remains in compliance with the Controlled Substances Act prior
to marketing any products containing CBDs. Both plans are contingent upon appropriate legal vetting.  

Hemp-infused
Energy Shots   

Hemp-infused
energy shots have been developed and are ready to bottle. Energy shots are a unique form of energy drink. Usually, they are sold
in 2-oz containers, whereas most energy drinks are sold in larger cans or bottles. Energy shots can be considered concentrated
forms of energy drinks. The leading energy shot brand in the United States is 5-Hour Energy, based on sales of about $1.05 billion
in 2015 .  The Company completed its first production run of mango and mixed berry energy shots during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and began sales of the shots in October 2017.

Hemp
Protein Bars and Hemp Chia Seed Bars are in pre-development stage. Ingredients are projected to include: honey, butter, rice protein,
oats, coconut, almonds, hemp proteins, brown rice, vanilla bean, sea salt, and in one variety, chia seeds. The chia seed is calorie
sparse and nutrient dense, and contains anti-oxidants and other essential nutrients. It also contains protein, and a range of
essential and non-essential amino acids and fiber.  

The
Company is targeting the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 to market them.  

Hemp-infused
Natural Spring Water   

Adding
hemp-infused natural spring water to our beverage line is in pre-development stage.  The Company plans to bottle the water,
market and sell it later in fiscal year 2017. Revenue generation should commence in the same quarter.  

Expected
Changes In Number of Employees, Plant, and Equipment   

We
do not currently plan to purchase specific additional physical plant and significant equipment within the immediate future. We
do not currently have specific plans to change the number of our employees during the next twelve months.

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Financial
Summary    

The
Company s sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $295,587 compared to $269,083 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The sales increase was driven by increased distributor sales in 2016.  

The
Company s net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $730,277 compared to net income of $6,291,872 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Sales    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 sales were $295,587 compared to $269,083 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $26,504 or 10%. The sales increase was driven by increased distributor sales in 2016 as a result of the addition
of distributors in 2016. In both periods, sales consisted of approximately 95% distributor sales and 5% online sales.  

Cost
of Sales    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $90,020 or 31% of sales, compared to $138,248 or 51% of sales for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $48,228 or 35%. Cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales in 2016
as a result of cost settlements related to the Company s hemp drink production run.

Operating
Expenses    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses were $1,182,089 or 400% of sales, compared to $555,411 or 206% of
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Areas in which the Company experienced material changes in operating expenses
are discussed below.  

General
and Administrative   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $864,549 or 293% of sales, compared to $357,590
or 133% of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2016 was
driven by an increase in officer and employee compensation, rent and storage expenses, and expenses related to the start up of
the Eagle Spirit Water brand.  

Advertising
and Marketing   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, advertising and marketing expenses were $317,540 or 107% of sales, compared to $197,821
or 74% of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in advertising and marketing expenses in 2016 was
due to increased promotional spending, broker commissions, promotions contractors, and advertising and promotional expenses related
to the start up of the Eagle Spirit water brand.  

Other
(Income) Expense    

Interest
Expense   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense was $234,519, compared to $46,377 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in interest expense, which includes the amortization of the discount on convertible debt and interest on
Series C Preferred Stock, was due to the increase in debt during fiscal year 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gain
on the Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability
of $480,794, compared to a gain of $6,762,825 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gain in 2015 resulted from a
decrease in the price of the underlying stock price used in the derivative calculation at fair value. In 2016 the
gain resulted from the decrease in the Company s stock price coupled with stock  price used in the decrease in
the outstanding warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2016. In both periods, the decrease in the related
liability resulted in a gain.  

Income
Taxes    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded no income tax provision due to a full valuation
allowance provided on deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had current assets in the amount of $2,156,521, consisting of accounts receivable of $264,880, inventory
in the amount of $259,360, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1,632,011. As of September 30, 2016, we had current
liabilities in the amount of $4,070,046. These consisted of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the amount of $643,348,
related party convertible notes of $103,352, convertible notes of $677,923, other debt of $35,960, accrued interest of $180,514,
deferred revenue of $500,000, and a derivative liability of $1,928,949.

Cash
flows from operating activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $556,056 compared to $191,154 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change was principally driven by the net loss in 2016 as compared to income in
2015 and the increase in accounts receivable during 2016. This was partially offset by the expenditures related to a hemp
drink production run in 2015 with no corresponding production run in 2016. Other significant changes in cash from operating
activities in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were an increase in accounts payable in 2016 of $305,482 compared to
an increase of $45,334 in 2015, and the increase of deferred revenue in 2015 with no corresponding change in 2016. Non-cash
gain on change in fair value of derivative liability decreased from $6,762,825 in 2015 to $480,764 in 2016  

Cash
flows from investing activities    

Net
cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $41,409 compared to $30,719 during the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The change was primarily due to the Company s investment in Rocky Mountain High Water
Company and furniture and equipment, partially offset by the disposal of vehicles in 2016.   

Cash
flows from financing activities    

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $505,210 compared to $167,750 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016, proceeds of $220,000 were from the issuance of convertible notes payable compared
to $0 in 2015. The Company also issued $35,000 in related party convertible notes payable and a $35,960 note payable for the acquisition
of furniture and equipment in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 in 2015. In 2016 there were proceeds
of $214,450 from the issuance of stock compared to $318,750 in 2015.  

Outstanding
Material Indebtedness    

Recently,
our operations have been funded primarily through the issuance of convertible promissory notes, which are convertible to common
stock at fixed prices ranging from $0.001 to $0.04, at discounts to market price ranging from 50% to 80%, or combinations thereof.
Our ability to successfully execute our business plan is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing and/or upon realizing
sales revenue sufficient to fund our ongoing expenses. Until we are able to sustain our ongoing operations through sales revenue,
we intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital
expenditures, working capital, or other cash requirements. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sales
of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available
to us on acceptable terms, or at all.  

During
2011 and 2012, the Company entered into a series of convertible notes with six lenders aggregating $110,000. These were one-year
terms notes at 12% interest and convertible to Common Stock at a conversion price of $.05 per share. As a part of the Bankruptcy
Reorganization Plan confirmed in July 2014, the accrued interest on these notes was forgiven and the notes became zero interest
bearing notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $36,400 of these notes were converted into 16,800,000 shares
of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the principal balance on these notes was $33,600.   

Table of Contents     

In
2012, the Company entered into a $40,000 Convertible Note Payable with an individual. The notes matured one-year from the date
of issuance, bear interest at 12% per annum, and is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $.001. In 2015, the lender sold
and re-assigned $17,500 of this note. The new note holders converted the $17,500 of principal into 17,500,000 shares of Common
Stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the holder converted the remaining principal balance of $22,500 to 25,000,000
shares of common stock.  

On
March 25, 2015, the Company entered into an amended and restated convertible promissory note with Roy Meadows, which amended two
previously issued notes dated February 5, 2013 and July 17, 2014. According to the terms of the note, the Company may borrow up
to an aggregate of $1,500,000. The note bears interest at 12% per annum, and the holder may demand repayment of any portion of
the note after one year from the effective date of the note. The note is convertible in whole or in part at a conversion price
per share equal to the lesser of $.001 per share, or at an 80% discount to the average of the five lowest bid prices during the
thirty trading days prior to the date of the conversion notice. Mr. Meadows is limited in his conversions whereby he may not at
any time own more than 9.99% of the Company s outstanding common stock. Mr. Meadows may, at his option, file a UCC-1 financing
statement against all assets of the Company and have a guarantee and security agreement with the principal controlling for majority
shareholders of the Company. On November 16, 2015, the debtholder converted $1,107,606 of principal and accrued interest into
1,107,607 shares of Preferred C Shares of the Company. Each Series C Preferred Share can be converted to 50 Shares of Common Stock.  

In
connection with the conversion, and as an inducement for the debtholder to convert, the Company issued him warrants to purchase
41,454,851 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price per share of the lesser of $.005 or an eighty percent
discount to the average of the five lowest bid prices during the 30 trading days prior to the date of exercise. The warrant may
be exercised, in whole or in part, beginning on the date which is the earlier of six months from the Company becoming a Reporting
Company (as defined in the warrant) or one year from the date of issuance. The warrant is for a period of 3 years, and contains
customary anti-dilution provisions.  

In
October 2015, the Company entered into a $500,000 note payable at 12% simple interest for a one year period with Roy Meadows.
The note is convertible upon maturity if not paid by the company prior thereto at $0.02 per share and a 25,000,000 share maximum.
There is an option to renew with a fee of 10% principle and accrued interest.  

The
Company has determined that the conversion feature embedded in the notes referred to above, that contain a potential variable
conversion amount, constitutes a derivative which has been bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability, with
a corresponding discount recorded to the associated debt. The excess of the derivative value over the face amount of the note
is recorded immediately to interest expense at inception. The discounts related to the above notes were completely amortized as
of June 30 and September 30, 2016. on the accompanying balance sheet.   

Future
Liquidity Requirements     

The
anticipated operational shortfall for the next twelve months is $1,200,000. For the two year period beyond the next twelve months,
we anticipate securing a revolving business line of credit to finance inventory production and accounts receivable. We anticipate
the line of credit needs to be between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. This allows flexibility needed to meet short term funding needs.  

Table of Contents     

We
have recently entered into a non-exclusive agreement for institutional financing services with Carter, Terry   Company. Our
goal is to work with them and our private sources of capital to raise capital to finance inventory production, increase advertising
and promotion budgets, develop new products and cover any shortfall from continuing operations.  

We
anticipate that initial funds raised will be through debt financing with additional capital raised through the sale of restricted
securities through an offering memorandum, the structure of which has yet to be determined.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

As
of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Going
Concern   

We
have experienced recurring losses from operations and to date, we have not been able to produce sufficient sales to become cash
flow positive and profitable on a consistent basis. The success of our business plan during the next 12 months and beyond will
be contingent upon generating sufficient revenue to cover our costs of operations and/or upon obtaining additional financing.
For these reasons, our auditor has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
We believe that the following accounting policies currently fit this definition:  

    Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of the Company s estimates could be affected by external
conditions, including those unique to its industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors
could have an effect on the Company s estimates that could cause actual results to differ from its estimates. The Company
re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary.  

   Cash

The
Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.  

   Revenue
Recognition        

  The
Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition. 
It records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the selling price to the
customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. The Company has not experienced any
significant returns from customers and accordingly, in management s opinion, no reserve for returns has been provided. Payments
received prior to shipment of goods are recorded as deferred revenue.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable    

  The
Company has a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
in our existing accounts receivable. We extend credit to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other
factors. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable and perform ongoing
credit evaluations of customers and maintain an allowance for potential bad debts if required.  

  It
is determined whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is required by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates
the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. In these cases, we use assumptions and judgment, based on the
best available facts and circumstances, to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable
to the amount expected to be collected. These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received.
The amounts calculated are analyzed to determine the total amount of the allowance. The Company may also record a general allowance
as necessary.  

  Direct
write-offs are taken in the period when we have exhausted our efforts to collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate
other circumstances that indicate the collectability of receivables.   

   Inventories   

  Inventories,
which consist of the Company s product held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in,
first-out, and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price, in the ordinary course of business,
less estimated costs to complete and dispose of the product.  

  If
the Company identifies excess, obsolete or unsalable items, its inventories are written down to their realizable value in the
period in which the impairment is first identified. Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases and product shipments
are recorded in cost of sales in the Company's statements of operations.   

   Fair
Value Measurements    

  The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value
as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair
value measurements.  

  The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature
of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective
yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances
of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk.  

Table of Contents     

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:   

Level 1   quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2   quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable. 

 Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example
cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions). 

The
derivative liability in connection with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a Level 3 liability, is
the only financial liability measure at fair value on a recurring basis.  

  The
change in the Level 3 financial instrument is as follows:  

The
estimated fair value of the derivative instruments were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following
assumptions as of September 30, 2016:  

Estimated Dividends  
      None   
 
      Expected Volatility  
      2.0%   
 
      Risk Free Interest Rate  
      .59%   
 
      Expected Term  
      .1 to 1.0 years   

Property
and Equipment   

  Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the
useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.  

   Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

  The
Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of
an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow
and recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset
plus the net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When the
Company identifies an impairment, it reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted
cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.  No impairment charges were recorded
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Share-Based
Payments    

  Share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements
based on their fair values, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. That expense is recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting
period). The Company had no common stock options or common stock equivalents granted or outstanding for all periods presented.  

  The
Company issued restricted stock to consultants and employees for various services. Cost for these transactions are measured at
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The value of the common stock is to be measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the
counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.  

   Convertible
Instruments   

  The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging Activities . Applicable GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances
in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related
to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded
derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be
considered a derivative instrument.  

   Preferred
Stock   

  We
apply the guidance enumerated in ASC 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  when determining the classification
and measurement of preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments
and are measured at fair value. We classify conditionally redeemable preferred shares (if any), which includes preferred shares
that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of
uncertain events not solely within our control, as temporary equity. At all other times, we classified our preferred shares in
stockholders  equity. Our preferred shares do not feature any redemption rights within the holders  control or conditional
redemption features not within our control. Accordingly all issuances of preferred stock are presented as a component of consolidated
stockholders  equity (deficit).  

   Advertising    

  Advertising
and marketing expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Income
Taxes   

  The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes. 
Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year
and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s
financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available
positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   

  ASC
Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern
 (Subtopic 205-40), (ASU No. 2014-15), which requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going
concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, ASU
2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt
is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures
when substantial doubt is not alleviated. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is permitted.  

  In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The
new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for public company fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017. The standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this standard, including the transition method, on its consolidated results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.  

Item
3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

A
smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item
4.     Controls and Procedures    

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016.
This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Welch,
and our Chief Financial Officer, Jens Mielke. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.   

Table of Contents     

Our
management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative
of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both
US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   

Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily
prevent all fraud and material error.   Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time,
control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
