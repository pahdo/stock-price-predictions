N    ote 1   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The consolidated balance sheets as of   September 24  , 2016 and March 26  , 201  6  , the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the quarters   and six months   ended   September 24  , 2016 and   September 26  , 2015  ,    the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders  equity for the   six months   ended   September 24  , 2016  ,    and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended September   24, 2016 and September 26, 2015,   include financial information for Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Monro Service Corporation and Car-X, LLC (collectively,  Monro ,  we ,  us ,  our ).  These unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Monro.  We believe all known adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals or adjustments) have been made to fairly state the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the unaudited periods presented. 

Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  The year-end consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 2  6, 2016  . 

We   report   our results on a 52/53 week fiscal year with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in March of each year.  The following are the dates represented by each fiscal period reported in these condensed financial statements: 

Fiscal year 201  7  , ending March 2  5  , 201  7  , is a 52 week year. 

Reclassifications 

Certain   amounts in these financial statements have been reclassified to maintain comparability among the periods presented. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB     )   issued new accounting guidance for the reporting of revenue from contracts with customers.  This guidance provides guidelines a company will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized.    Additional guidance has subsequently been issued to amend or clarify the reporting of revenue from contracts with customers.        In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of the guidance to fiscal years   and interim periods within those years   beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date   of December 15, 2016  .  We are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the disclosure of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  This guidance establishes specific guidelines to an organization s management on their responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  This guidance is not expected to have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to leases.  This guidance establishes a right of use (     ROU     ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.   The   guidance   is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the   p  otential   impact of the   adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for share-based payments and their presentation in the financial statements.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to cash flow classification.  This guidance clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the Accounting Standards Codification) and the   Securities and Exchange Commission   did not, or are not expected to have a material effect on Monro s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Guarantees 

At the time we issue a guarantee, we recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligation we assume under that guarantee.  Monro has   guaranteed certain lease payments, primarily related to franchisees, amounting to   $9.  1     million.  This amount represents the maximum potential amount of future payme  nts under the guarantees as of   September 24  , 2016  .  The   leases   are guaranteed through April 2020  .  In the event of default by the franchise owner,   Monro   generally retain  s   the right to assume the lease of the related store, enabling   Monro   to re-franchise the location or   to operate that location as a C  om  pany-  operated   store.  As of   September 24  , 2016, we have   recorded a liability of   $.  7   million related to anticipated   defaults under the foregoing leases  .        As of September 26, 2015,   no   liability was recorded.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On June 26, 2016, we acquired   one   retail tire and automotive repair store located in Michigan from Harlow Tire Company.  This store   operates under the Monro name.

The  se   acquisitions resulted in goodwill related to, among other things, growth opportunities, synergies and economies of scale expected from combini  n  g    th  e  s  e   business  es   with ours,   as well as   unidentifiable intangible assets.  All of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  We have recorded finite-lived intangible assets at their estimated fair value related to customer   lists  , favorable leases and   trade name  s  . 

We expensed all costs related to acquisitions in the six months ended September 24, 2016.  The total costs related to completed acquisitions were   $.2   million and   $.4   million for the three and six months ended September 24, 2016, respectively.  These costs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily under operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Sales for the fiscal 201  7   acqui  red entities   for the three   and six   months ended   September 24  , 2016   totaled   $  16.7   million   and   $25.6   million, respectively,     for the period from acquisition date through   September 24  , 2016  . 

Supplemental pro forma information for the current or prior reporting periods has not been presented due to the impracticability of obtaining detailed, accurate or reliable data for the periods the acquired entities were not owned by Monro.  

The preliminary fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on preliminary valuations and estimates.  The excess of the net purchase price over net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.  The preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price as of   September 24  , 2016   was as follows:  

The total consideration of $129.1 million is comprised of   $129   million in cash, and a   $.1   million payable to a seller.  The payable is being   paid   via equal annual payments through   September   2019.

The   following   are the intangible assets acquired and their respective fair values and weighted average useful lives:  

Fiscal 201  6 

During   the first six months of   fiscal 2016, we acquired the following businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $49.6 million.  The acquisitions were financed through our existing credit facility.  The results of operations for these acquisitions are included in Monro s financial results from the respective acquisition dates. 

In July and August 2015, we acquired   three   retail tire and automotive repair stores located in Illinois and Indiana from   two   former Car-X franchisees.  These stores operate under the Car-X name.   

On August     16, 2015, we acquired   27   retail tire and automotive repair stores located in Central New York and Pennsylvania from Kost Tire.  These stores operate under the Mr. Tire name. 

On July     12, 2015, we acquired   four   retail tire and automotive repair stores located in Massachusetts from Windsor Tire Co., Inc.  These stores operate under the Monro name. 

On April     25, 2015, we acquired the Car-X Brand, as well as the franchise rights for   146   auto service centers from Car-X Associates Corp., a subsidiary of Tuffy Associates Corp.    At the time of acquisition,     the   Car-X stores   we  re owned and operated by   32     independent Car-X franchisees in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.  The franchise locations operate under the Car-X name.  Monro operates as the franchisor through a standard royalty agreement, while Car-X remains a separate and independent brand and business through Car-X, LLC, Monro s wholly-owned subsidiary, with franchise   operations based in Illinois. 

The acquisition  s   resulted in goodwill related to, among other things, growth opportunities, synergies and economies of scale expected from combining this business with ours, and unidentifiable intangible assets.      All of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.      We have recorded finite-lived intangible assets at their estimated fair value related to   customer relationships, trade name, favorable leases and   franchise agreements. 

We expensed all costs related to acquisitions in the   six   months ended   September 26  , 2015.      The total costs related to completed acquisitions were   $.3   million and   $.5   million   for the three   and six   months ended   September 26  , 2015  , respectively  .       These costs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily under operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Sales for the fiscal 2016 acquired entities, including franchise royalty income, for the three and six months ended September     26, 2015 totaled   $5.3   million and   $6.0   million, respectively, for the period from acquisition date through September     26, 2015. 

Supplemental pro forma information for the current or prior reporting periods has not been presented due to the impracticability of obtaining detailed, accurate or reliable data for the periods the acquired entities were not owned by Monro.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

We have recorded the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of their respective acquisition dates (including any measurement period adjustments), with the remainder recorded as goodwill as follows: 

The total consideration of   $49.6   million is comprised of   $43.6   million in cash, and a   $6.0   million payable to   a   seller.  The payable is being liquidated via equal monthly payments through August 2022. 

The following are the intangible assets acquired and their respective fair values and weighted average useful lives: 

As a result of the purchase price allocations   that have been updated from the   fiscal   year ended March 26, 2016  , certain of the fair value amounts previously estimated were adjusted during the measurement period.  These measurement period adjustments related to updated valuation reports and appraisals received from our external valuation specialists, as well as revisions to internal estimates.  The changes in estimates include an increase in   trade receivables   of   $.1   million; an increase in property, plant and equipment of   $1.  3     million; an increase in long-term deferred income tax assets of   $1.2   million; an increase in other current liabilities of   $.  5   million  ;   and an increase in long-term capital leases and financing obligations of   $  4  .0   million.  The measurement period adjustments resulted in an increase   of   goodwill of   $1.  9   million. 

These measurement period adjustments were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the quarter and six months ended September 24, 2016, respectively.       

We continue to refine the valuation data and estimates primarily related to inventory, road hazard warranty, intangible assets, real estate and real property leases for fiscal 2016 acquisitions which closed subsequent to September 26, 2015, and for the fiscal 2017 acquisitions, and expect to complete valuations no later than the first anniversary date of the respective acquisition.  We anticipate that adjustments will continue to be made to the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and those adjustments may or may not be material.

Note 3   Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) amounts are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders, after   deducting   preferred stock dividends, by the average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent securities outstanding. 

The   following   is a reconciliation of basic and diluted EPS for the respective periods: 

The computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the assumed exercise of approximately   2  43  ,000     and   241  ,000   stock   options for the three   and six   months ended   fiscal   September 24  , 2016  ,   respectively  , and   168,000   and   172,000   for the three and six months ended September 26, 2015, respectively  .  Such amounts were excluded as the exercise prices   of   these stock options were greater than the average market value of our Common Stock for those periods, resulting in an anti-dilutive effect on diluted EPS.    

Note 4   Income Taxes 

In the normal course of business, we provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties, and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties accordingly.  The total amounts of   unrecognized tax benefits were   $7.  5     million and   $  6.9     million at   September 24  , 2016     and March 26  , 201  6  , respectively, the majority of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.  As of   September 24  , 2016  , we had approximately   $  .  5   million of interest and penalties accrued related   to unrecognized tax benefits.

Results of Operations 

The following table   sets   forth income statement data of Monro expressed as a percentage of sales for the fiscal periods indicated: 

Second Quarter and Six Months Ended September 24, 2016 Compared to Second Quarter and Six Months Ended September   26,   2015 

Sales were $248.6 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 as compared with $239.2 million for the quarter ended September 26, 2015.  The sales increase of $9.4 million, or 3.9%, was due to an increase of $22.3 million related to new stores, of which $20.1 million came from the fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 acquisitions.  Largely offsetting this was a decrease in comparable store sales of 4.3%.  Additionally, there was a decrease in sales from closed stores amounting to $2.3 million.  There were 91 selling days in both the quarters ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015.   

Barter sales of slower moving inventory totaled approximately $1.4 million and $2.0 million for the quarters ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively.  There were no barter sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017. 

Sales were $485.5 million for the six months ended September 24, 2016 as compared with $475.7 million for the six months ended September 26, 2015.  The sales increase of $9.8 million, or 2.1%, was due to an increase of $40.9 million related to new stores, of which $37.0 million came from the fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 acquisitions.  Largely offsetting this was a decrease in comparable store sales of 5.6%.  Additionally, there was a decrease in sales from closed stores amounting to $4.6 million.  There were 181 selling days in the first six months of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Table of Contents  

At September 24, 2016, we had 1,097 Company-operated stores and 132 franchised locations as compared with 1,029 Company-operated stores and 143 franchised locations at September 26, 2015.  (At March 26, 2016, we had 1,029 Company-operated stores and 135 franchised locations.)  During the quarter ended September 24, 2016, we added 36 Company-operated stores (including one purchased from an existing franchisee) and closed three stores.  During the quarter ended September 24, 2016, one franchised location closed and we purchased one from an existing franchisee as a Company-operated store.  Year-to-date, we have added 72 Company-operated stores (including one purchased from an existing franchisee) and closed four stores.  Additionally, two franchised locations have closed   and   we purchased one franchised location from an existing franchisee as a Company-operated store. 

We believe that the   decline   in comparable store sales resulted mainly from a continued weak consumer spending environment and from the lingering impact of milder winter weather in our markets. 

Gross profit for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 was $100.0 million or 40.2% of sales as compared with $100.7 million or 42.1% of sales for the quarter ended September 26, 2015.  The decrease in gross profit for the quarter ended September 24, 2016, as a percentage of   sales  , was primarily due to an increase in material costs, including outside purchases, which increased as a percentage of sales as compared to the quarter ended September 26, 2015.  Product costs, especially in tires, were down this quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.  However, this was offset by a shift in mix from the higher margin service categories to the lower margin tire category, as well as the impact of acquisitions.   

On a consolidated basis, labor costs increased slightly as a percentage of sales due to the impact of negative comparable store sales.  Distribution and occupancy costs decreased moderately as a percentage of sales, largely due to distribution cost savings. 

On a comparable store basis, gross margin decreased by 30 basis points, driven by the deleveraging impact of fixed costs against negative   comparable   store sales. 

Gross profit for the six months ended September 24, 2016 was $198.1 million or 40.8% of sales as compared with $200.4 million or 42.1% of sales for the six months ended September 26, 2015.  The year-to-date decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales was largely due to   increased   material costs as described above.  Additionally, labor costs increased and distribution and occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year. 

On a   comparable   store basis, gross margin for the six months ended September 24, 2016 was relatively flat at 42.3% for the current year period versus 42.2% for the same period in the prior year. 

Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 were $68.1 million or 27.4% of sales as compared with $66.6 million or 27.9% of sales for the quarter ended September 26, 2015.  The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to decreased incentive compensation expense related to pay plans that pay based on performance.  Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in intangible amortization and loss on closed stores as compared to the prior year quarter.  In the prior year, the Company realized a gain on the sale of a closed store which did not occur in the current year quarter.  On a comparable store basis, operating expenses for the quarter   ended   September 24, 2016 decreased by approximately $2 million as compared to the same quarter of the prior year. 

For the six months ended September 24, 2016, operating expenses increased by $2.1 million to $134.8 million from the comparable period of the prior year and were 27.8% of sales as compared to 27.9% of sales for the six months ended September 26, 2015.  The increase primarily relates to increased expenses for new stores, as well as an increase in intangible amortization and loss on disposal of fixed assets,   partially   offset by reduced incentive compensation and benefit costs.  On a comparable store basis, operating expenses for the six months ended September 24, 2016 decreased by approximately $4.5 million as compared to the comparable period of the prior year.  We believe that this demonstrates the effectiveness of our strong cost control in a period of soft sales. 

Operating income for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 of approximately $31.9 million decreased by 6.4% as compared to operating income of approximately $34.1 million for the quarter ended September 26, 2015, and decreased as a percentage of sales from 14.3% to 12.8% for the reasons described above. 

Operating income for the six months ended September 24, 2016 of approximately $63.2 million decreased by 6.6% as compared to operating income of approximately $67.7 million for the six months ended September 26, 2015, and decreased as a percentage of sales from 14.2% to 13.0% for the reasons described above. 

Net interest expense for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 increased by approximately $.7 million as compared to the same period in the prior year, and increased from 1.6% to 1.8% as a percentage of sales for the same periods.  The weighted average debt outstanding for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 increased by approximately $56 million as compared to the quarter ended September 26, 2015.  This increase is due to an increase in debt outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility agreement, as well as an increase in capital lease debt recorded in connection with the fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 acquisitions.  The weighted average interest rate for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 remained relatively flat as compared to the second quarter of the prior year.

Table of Contents  

Net interest expense for the six months ended September 24, 2016 increased by approximately $1.8 million as compared to the same period in the prior year, and increased from 1.5% to 1.8% as a percentage of sales for the same periods.  Weighted average debt increased by approximately $75 million and the weighted average interest rate decreased by approximately 20 basis points as compared   to   the same period of the prior year. 

The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 was 36.3% and 38.0%, respectively, of pre-tax   income  .  The decrease in the rate was due to a variety of factors, none of which was individually significant. 

The effective tax rate for the six months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 was 37.1% and 38.0%, respectively, of pre-tax income. 

Net income for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 of $17.5 million decreased 7.0% from net income for the quarter ended   September   26, 2015.  Earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter ended September 24, 2016 of $.53 decreased 7.0%. 

For the   six   months ended September 24, 2016, net income of $34.3 million decreased 9.0% and diluted earnings per share of $1.03 decreased 9.6%. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Capital Resources 

Our primary capital requirements in fiscal 2017 are the upgrading of facilities and systems and the funding of our store expansion program, including potential acquisitions of existing store chains.  For the six months ended September 24, 2016, we spent approximately $148 million on these items.  Capital requirements were met primarily by cash flow from operations and from our revolving credit facility. 

In May 2016, our Board of Directors declared its intention to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.17 per common share or common share equivalent beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  We paid dividends of $11.2 million during the six months ended September 24, 2016.  However, the declaration of and any determination as to the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Monro s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with charter and credit facility restrictions, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. 

Additionally, the acquisitions subsequent to September 24, 2016 were financed through our existing credit facility. 

We plan to continue to seek suitable acquisition candidates.  We believe we have sufficient resources available (including cash flow from operations and bank financing) to expand our business as currently planned for the next twelve months. 

Liquidity 

In June 2011, we entered into a five-year, $175 million Revolving Credit Facility agreement with seven banks.  This Revolving Credit Facility also provided an accordion feature permitting us to request an increase in availability of up to an additional $75 million. 

In December 2012, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to include the following: the committed sum was increased by $75 million to $250 million; the term was extended for another one and a half years, such that the Facility expired in December 2017; and the $75 million accordion feature was maintained.  There were no other changes in terms including those related to covenants or interest rates.   

In January 2016, we entered into a new five-year $600 million Revolving Credit Facility agreement with nine banks (the  Credit Facility ).  Interest only is payable monthly throughout the Credit Facility s term.  The Credit Facility increases our current borrowing capacity from our prior financing agreement by $350 million to $600 million, and includes an accordion feature permitting us to request an increase in availability of up to an additional $100 million, an increase of $25 million from our prior financing agreement.  The expanded facility bears interest at 75 to 175 basis points over LIBOR.  The Credit Facility requires fees payable quarterly throughout the term between .15% and .35% of the amount of the average net availability under the Credit Facility during the preceding quarter.  There was $197.4 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at September 24, 2016.   

Within the Credit Facility, we have a sub-facility of $80 million available for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit.  The line requires fees aggregating 87.5 to 187.5 basis points over LIBOR annually of the face amount of each standby letter of credit, payable quarterly in arrears.  There was $26.5 million in an outstanding letter of credit at September 24, 2016. 

The net availability under the Credit Facility at September 24, 2016 was $376.1 million. 

16   

Table of Contents  

Specific terms of the Credit Facility permit the payment of cash dividends not to exceed 50% of the prior year s net income, and permit mortgages and specific lease financing arrangements with other parties with certain limitations.  Other specific terms and the maintenance of specified ratios are generally consistent with our prior financing agreement.  Additionally, the Credit Facility is not secured by our real property, although we have agreed not to encumber our real property, with certain permissible exceptions.  We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 24, 2016. 

In addition, we have financed certain store properties and equipment with capital leases/financing obligations, which amounted to $198.9 million at September 24, 2016 and are due in installments through fiscal year 2045.  We also have a $.1 million payable to a seller at September 24, 2016, due in equal installments through September 2019. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  in Note 1 of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 24, 2016 and the expected impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements for future periods.    

It    em   3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates.  There was no fixed rate debt outstanding at September 24, 2016.  Our cash flow exposure on floating rate debt would result in annual interest expense fluctuations of approximately $2.0 million based upon our debt position at September 24, 2016 and $1.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 26, 2016, given a 1% change in LIBOR. 

Debt financing had a carrying amount and a fair value of $197.5 million as of September 24, 2016, as compared to a carrying amount and a fair value of $103.3 million as of March 26, 2016.
